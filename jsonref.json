Emoitional: The Talk is also looking a frequent guests hosts Carrie Ann Inaba and Carnie Wilson per sources close to the production (Inaba in tears in the day Chen announced her exit)          Off they go: Chen is staying on for the next season of Big brother despite leaving The TalkThe Talk has used this tactic in the past as well, most recently prior to the show\u0027s decision to hire Eve.A host of women came on as guests hosts, including singer Michelle Williams and Inaba, after the departure of Aisha Tyler just before the start of the eighth season.Eve was not named as Tyler\u0027s replacement, however, until November, right in the middle of the most important time of the year for any television show - sweeps.It would be no surprise if history repeats itself, and a tune-in to unveil the new host comes in late October or November.In the immediate aftermath of Chen\u0027s departure Inaba stepped in to take her place as did Wilson, with more guest hosts slated to drop by this week. Chen announced the news at the end of the show\u0027s episode on Tuesday in a taped message, fighting back tears as she shared her decision with viewers.She had not yet appeared on the show\u0027s ninth season, and announced that she would be going on indefinite leave last Monday after CBS forced her husband to resign as CEO and chairman.Ten days later she made the leave definite, stating: \u0027I have been at The Talk since the day it started nine years ago and the cast, crew and staff have become family over the years.\u0027Right now I need to spend more time at home with my husband and our young son. So I have decided to leave The Talk.\u0027CBS applauded the hosts in the wake of the announcement on Tuesday.\u0027For eight seasons, Julie Chen has co-hosted The Talk with incredible energy, grace and professionalism. Her talents played a big role in our successful launch of CBS’ first network daytime talk show, and in the series growth into an Emmy Award-winning broadcast,\u0027 read the statement.\u0027All of us here have tremendous appreciation for the dedication and passion she brought to the show every day and for her generous role as an ambassador for CBS Daytime.

Ben Sherman struggled to keep up with demand and alternatives from Brutus and Jaytex were also available in similar styles. Boots were one of the most important parts of the skinhead uniform before being classified as weapons and the Doc Martens style moved in. The worker boots often worn by coal miners featured steel toecaps and hobnail boots which included metal studs on its sole.            The scene at Brighton railway station where two dozen police officers sorted out, searched and warned groups of skinheads as they arrived in the town on the Bank Holiday weekend in August 1970           Skinheads being marched back to the railway station at Southend Essex where a strong police turnout prevented the invading skinhead group from causing trouble although shop windows were broken earlier in the day in August 1982Police search for missing British millionaire and wife after feudPolice search for retired British millionaire and Thai wifeCouple take elderly woman\u0027s purse moments before heart attackTiger Woods wins his first tournament in five years after injuriesCorbyn says next Labour government will have \u0027majority of women MPs\u0027Duchess of Sussex had first date fabric sewn into wedding dressChristine Blasey Ford agrees to testify to Senate committeeElephants get angry after man jumps into enclosure at Copenhagen ZooPaul Gosar\u0027s siblings endorse rival in new campaign ad adOktoberfest kicks off in Munich as six million people are expected\u0027Stubbornly optimistic\u0027 Brexit secretary outlines risks of no-deal"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/24/17/509CD39700000578-6202067-image-a-61_1537806438653.jpg","title":"Weight Watchers slims WW","story":"    What\u0027s in a name: Weight Watchers has decided to trim its name down to WW to focus on overall wellness and not just weight loss          Recently appointed WW President and CEO Mindy Grossman, formerly of the Home Shopping Netwirj, drove the message home during her appearance on the Today Show this morning. \u0027We will never abdicate our leadership in the best healthy eating program for weight loss in the world, but we can be some much more today,\u0027 she said.  WW has seen a rise in subscribers, helped by a 2015 investment by Oprah Winfrey. The media mogul paid $43million for a 10 per cent stake, joined the company\u0027s board and has appeared in commercials promoting her weight loss. Earlier this year, Winfrey sold a portion of her shares. \u0027The role WW can play in people\u0027s lives goes far beyond a number on the scale,\u0027 Winfrey said in a press release announcing the company\u0027s renaming. \u0027As Weight Watchers becomes WW, I believe we will continue to inspire people not only to eat well, but to move more, connect with others and continue to experience the joys of a healthy life.\u0027           Spreading the word: WW President and Chief Executive Officer Mindy Grossman (left) went on the Today Show Monday to discuss the company\u0027s rebranding           Celebrity spokeswoman: The company got a major boost in 2015, when Oprah Winfrey bought a 10 per cent stake in Weight Watchers and joined its boardWW had 4.5 million subscribers at the end of June, a 28 per cent increase from the same period a year before.The company has been making efforts to draw more male subscribers.

Salvini presented the decree to journalists alongside Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte (left) on MondayThe remainder were rejected. If appeals fail, they face the prospect of being classed as economic migrants who must return home.Those seeking refugee status will now have their requests suspended if they are considered \u0027socially dangerous or convicted in the first instance\u0027 of crimes, while their appeals are ongoing.They will also in future be housed in bigger reception centres, while only minors and those with recognised refugee status will be housed in different parts of the country in order to facilitate integration.There are currently around 155,000 migrants held in reception centres, down from 183,000 at the end of 2017.The Italian mayors\u0027 association has railed against the change as having hundreds of unemployed migrants in reception centres can have a negative impact on small communities.     President Sergio Mattarella (above) has 60 days to sign the legislation and then it goes to Parliament for approvalThe new law also lets local police have Taser stun guns and makes it easier to evict squatters by getting rid of the obligation of finding provisional housing for the most vulnerable.The controversial bill has been heavily criticised in recent weeks, including by members of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) which governs in coalition with Salvini\u0027s far-right League.One of the most controversial measures in the bill provides for stripping immigrants of their Italian nationality if they are convicted of \u0027terrorism\u0027.Italian media reported that President Mattarella obtained amendments to the draft after threatening not to sign it, an obligatory step on the bill\u0027s way to parliament.The cabinet passed the decree unanimously but fellow deputy prime minister and M5S head Luigi di Maio warned that \u0027there are points (in the bill) that are not in the government programme and so will be discussed in parliament.\u0027The head of Italy\u0027s bishops\u0027 conference Nunzio Galantino has lamented the fact that security and the treatment of migrants are dealt with in the same bill.\u0027This means that the immigrant is already judged because of his condition and that he\u0027s already considered a public menace, whatever his behaviour.

Bills said without the untimely deaths and an inheritance left by his uncle there was no way Gainsborough could have afforded to train as a young artist in London.There are gaps in the story that may never be filled in, including who the perpetrators were, but the bones of the crime story are there. The uncle and and his son were successful businessmen with interests in Suffolk and London. Their downfall came when they were involved in pursuing debts owed to John Barnard, a Sudbury mercer, evidently leading them in to the path of dangerous criminals.The Art Newspaper has also been involved in the research, tracking down brutal threatening letters directed against the cousin. One read: “We will either shoot him or hang him up in gibbets, damn the … rogue’s arse.”The letters claim the Gainsboroughs ruined a friend, Richard Brock, who was being pursued over the debt. It demanded they stop. “We will come down and blow you up with gunpowder, God damn you” – or else feed “a meal that you will not like”.An ultimatum was given to drop the claim against Brock. Within a week the cousin was dead. The uncle was undeterred and continued to pursue the debt. He was killed six months later at the Golden Fleece in Cornhill in the City of London, a pub very close to the coach stop from Sudbury.Months before his murder, the uncle remade his will and one of his biggest wishes was that his young nephew Thomas should get a good start in life. He left £40 for him to find “a light handicraft”. It was money that allowed the family to send him to London aged 13 to train as an artist under the engraver Hubert Gravelot.Bills said there must have been fears for the safety of the artist’s father and family and that was a factor in moving the boy to the anonymity of the capital.The events, and the fact that Gainsborough’s father was hopeless with money and had been bankrupted, had a profound impact on Gainsborough. He married a woman with a guaranteed income and undertook portraiture that provided good money over his greater passion for painting landscapes.“I think people who have been really poor never lose that concern about money,” Bills said.The revelations feature in an exhibition opening at the museum in October, featuring 40 works from private and public collections.• Early Gainsborough: From the Obscurity of a Country Town is at Gainsborough’s House, Sudbury, 20 October-17 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cfe1a253f8ba344b095b0127ab9a2f5a15e3690/393_720_2949_1769/master/2949.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd38cb472ba65705944ea2c1cccc8ce5","title":"royal navy photographic competition winners in pictures","story":"The winners of the Royal Navy photographic competition, the Peregrine trophy awards, have been announced.

Her novel imagines those last moments It was the manner of her death that was so brutal. It was gruesome. When Louisa Collins became the first woman hanged at Darlinghurst jail and the last woman hanged in New South Wales, the executioner botched the job. The trap door didn’t open, and then, after being banged with a mallet, it did open, and she fell through with so much force that her head was nearly severed and her windpipe left exposed.It was an image, says author Janet Lee, “that stuck with me, the image of the woman on the scaffold. Here was this woman who had never been known to confess, who expected a reprieve – was that what she was thinking in those last few moments?”Collins had walked calmly to her death on 8 January 1889, stoic, pitiful, believing her life would be spared at the last minute. “They will never hang a woman,” she had declared in the last hours of her life.Her death was controversial. A saga covered in salacious detail by the newspapers of the day, fiercely debated in parliament, heavily petitioned by the men and women of the colony. The 41-year-old mother of 10 children had endured four trials for the deaths of both her husbands, allegedly by arsenic found in rat poison she was one of the only people in the world to be tried four times for murder.The evidence against her was circumstantial. She had nursed them both as they lay dying of similar violent stomach illnesses. One trial for the wilful murder of her first husband, Charles Andrews, and two for her second husband, Michael Collins, had returned hung juries – all of whom were men, 36 in total. The crown pressed on with a fourth trial, for Michael Collins, and finally got their guilty verdict. The chief witness was her 11-year-old daughter May, who testified that she had seen a box of the poison Rough on Rats in the kitchen.Louisa Collins represented a threat to the men of the colony, and her story was political. In opposition, Sir Henry Parkes had argued for mercy in a previous hanging case for rape. Now that he was premier he was decidedly in favour of the hanging of Louisa, who thundered that the alleged murder of her second husband was “one of the most cruel, inexcusable, and frightful murders ... in the world’s history.”Doctors who attended Michael noted that Louisa had been drinking alcohol, and the police reported that she was inebriated when arrested – unseemly behaviour for a woman. It was reported that she was “cold” in the courtroom during her trials. “She didn’t show a lot of expression, something that might have been held against her,” says Lee. “She wasn’t typical of that era, she was not weeping or weak.”Even so, she begged for her life in a letter to Govenor Carrington two days before her death. “Oh my Lord. Pray have mercy and pity on me and spare my life. I beg and implore you to have mercy on me. I have seven children ... spare me my Lord for their sake.”Lee’s novel The Killing of Louisa is written in the first person, as Collins awaits the gallows and talks about her life to the priest.Lee says: “In my head this is very much fiction I have picked out little pieces of the story and imagined things around those. There were hundreds of newspaper articles, I went and revisited all the primary sources the NSW archives has the judges records written in this beautiful spidery hand writing. I used the facts as we know them as a guide, and tried not to stray too far.”She describes how hard life was for poor, working-class women. Louisa was born in Belltrees, in the Hunter Valley, and was sent away at 14 to be a domestic in the Merriwa home of a solicitor, where she became a “country coquette”, it was reported.At the urging of her mother she married the local butcher, Charles Andrews, at 18 he was 13 years older and she later said “had always been boring”. She had children in quick succession, two dying in infancy, and the family moved to Botany. But it was a drudge feeding all those children, washing, cooking for the boarders the family took in Louisa would retreat to the pub.“They had incredibly hard lives, the clothing was so restrictive,” Lee says. “It just would have been every single day boiling the copper, washing clothes, lugging the water the day to day effort of that era would have just worn you down, everything was so labour intensive.”Louisa could also be overly fond of the boarders, in particular the much younger Michael Collins, whom Charles threw out in a fight in the street and who, Lee says, “was a bit of a rogue”. Collins was soon back after Charles’s death. Louisa was very eager to get Charles’s will drawn up as he lay dying, and rushed to collect his insurance policy after his death. She did not wear black mourning clothes, instead throwing a party and dancing with her lover. She was pregnant when she married Collins three months later their child, John, died in infancy, and 13 months after their marriage, Collins too was dead.It is hard to see what her motive might have been for this death: a woman with so many children had no way of supporting herself she needed a husband. By then the insurance money was gone – Michael Collins was a gambler.Lee’s book follows on from the 2014 book Last Woman Hanged: a meticulous five-year investigation into Louisa’s life and death by Caroline Overington. Neither woman will speculate on whether Collins was guilty. “I know enough to know I don’t know,” says Lee.“I don’t know if Louisa was guilty,” Overington tells  Australia, “but neither, beyond a reasonable doubt, did the fourth and final jury nor did the judge who sentenced her to hang, despite the prosecution having no weapon, no witnesses, and no motive for the death of Michael Collins.”The women who petitioned for Louisa would go on to form the suffragette movement. “There was an enormous move in Australia at that time to give women more rights women were starting to fight for the vote.”Louisa Collins represented a threat to the men of the colony, her story was political.“How can it be,” says Overington “that we know the names of the bushrangers, the gold diggers, the explorers, but not this fascinating story of a woman who faced four juries on a charge of murder. Our silence has allowed braying mobs to form around other women both in the dock (Lindy Chamberlain) and in the court of public opinion it allowed the framing of women as calculating and manipulative to continue for another century it encouraged the idea that a sexually adventurous, curious, rebellious woman – Louisa liked to drink and dance and be in love – is immoral, a danger to society. We must dispense with her at once!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5d868ef1d7c8c770371f6d02dc7bd972eb6c768/0_171_5256_3154/master/5256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=913028a4c196cb5c536afe04c817e084","title":"sleepless in seattle which city gets the least shuteye","story":"Around the world weary workers are staying late at the office or taking naps on the job – while data reveals the link between sleep and wagesKonomu Suido is a rarity among Tokyo executives: most evenings, he gets home in time to cook dinner with his girlfriend. “There’s an expectation in Tokyo that you shouldn’t leave work before your boss,” he explains. For many of the city’s suits, sleep is often fleeting.It’s the same in many cities around the world, with working hours and lengthy commutes encroaching on bedtimes. Sleeplessness seems a particular problem – even a badge of honour – in urban centres of power and innovation, with rest long derided as an opportunity cost by society’s leaders. Margaret Thatcher claimed to sleep just four hours a night – now it’s Elon Musk defending his 120-hour work weeks, telling Arianna Huffington that sleep is not an option.A growing industry has emerged to offer short-term respite to weary workers. In Tokyo, Madrid, New York and many other cities around the world, nap time is being monetised through sleep pods like those belonging to Pop \u0026amp Rest, a new startup in London. At its Shoreditch base customers pay £15 to sleep for an hour while listening to ocean waves and inhaling scented oils.When scoping out cities for further expansion, founder Mauricio Villamizar tells me he maps urban commuting times the longer people commute to work, the less time they spend in bed. “As long as a city has a dense population of commuters and a business district, there’s a market for us,” he says.But commuting times alone don’t show which city gets the least shuteye. Noise, light pollution, sunset times and inidual factors like income all play a part. Where researchers once depended on labs for data, the arrival of fitness-tracking wristbands has made it possible to study entire cities – and find out which one sleeps the least.According to 2014 data from Jawbone wearable technology, it is Japan’s capital city, where people clock an average five hours and 46 minutes each night. The data, collected from 1,600 people across 21 cities, found that Melbourne gets the most sleep, averaging 7 hours and 5 minutes each night. Close second is London, where people sleep for 7 hours and 2 minutes. Tokyo, Seoul and Dubai sit at the bottom end of the sleep spectrum. But the Jawbone data set, while sizeable, only represents those who were able to afford one of the gadgets.Matthew Gibson, an economist who studies sleep and productivity, reckons that rest is linked to a city’s sunset time – and its wages. Gibson began thinking about sleep late one night while driving to a conference with his colleague, Jeffrey Shrader. The two professors were discussing the papers that their advisors wouldn’t want them to write. “We thought: ‘sleep takes up a third of our lives, but nobody in economics is looking at it’,” he says by phone from his Massachusetts office.Using Salt Lake City and Denver as examples, Gibson and Shrader’s theory is striking. The two cities occupy the same US time zone, but in Denver the sun sets almost 30 minutes earlier. According to 2016 data from the US Census Bureau, Denver’s average household income was $7,446 (£5,695) higher than that of Salt Lake City.But there’s a chicken-and-egg relationship between sleep and wages, Gibson cautions – sleep can be both a cause and consequence of income. Getting little sleep may be one of the reasons why someone is paid less, because it runs down their productivity and physical health. Conversely, concerns about money may make it more difficult to sleep.This two-way relationship complicates researchers’ efforts to determine whether sleep deprivation causes poverty, or vice versa. It’s also tricky to figure out how much sleep deprivation among the urban poor is due to environmental factors like noise, crime and light pollution, which all affect one’s ability to sleep easy at night.But if poor sleep is generally correlated with lower wages, do poorer cities sleep less? It’s hard to test the hypothesis, there being far less information about sleep patterns in cities near the equator than about western cities.In Chennai, on India’s east coast, people fall asleep in improbable locations – by roadsides, on the back of cycle rickshaws, and in noisy and crowded streets. When development economist Heather Schofield first visited the city, she was struck by its numerous daytime sleepers. “They got me thinking – how tired must people be to fall asleep in these crazy places?” she says.Night-time is frenetic in Chennai, where overcrowding and noise stem from rapid urbanisation and widespread poverty. Schofield describes how four or five people might be trying to sleep in a single room, with trucks rumbling past their door, in 90F (32C) degree heat, circled by thirsty mosquitos. On top of this are the compounded stresses of living in poverty.Among development economists, sleep isn’t a mainstream subject. Schofield wants to change that, and as a result, the lab run by Schofield and colleagues in Chennai is pioneering a study into the impact of improved sleep on poverty reduction. So far, the lab has found that participants sleep an average of five and a half hours a night. By distributing sleep mats and earplugs, it has managed to increase night-time sleep by an extra 30 minutes.Yet if less sleep is associated with lower wages, shouldn’t people in Tokyo, where average incomes are higher, be getting more sleep than those in Chennai?The results don’t necessarily tally with what we expect. In fact, sleep may have more to do with whether people feel in control of their circumstances than the amount of money they earn. Michael Grandner, a psychologist at the University of Arizona, explains that exceeding a comfortable income bracket tends to be associated with sleeping less – not more.This pattern can be explained by how much control iniduals feel they have over their sleep patterns. As Grandner puts it, “Some people need to work three jobs to put food on the table. For others, their time is too valuable to take a break. Neither feels like they can afford to sleep”.Ultimately, that means for people living in crowded Chennai or overworked Tokyo, sleep is more likely to feel beyond their control – and therefore be fleeting.Follow  Cities on\u0026nbspTwitter,\u0026nbspFacebook\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspInstagram\u0026nbspto join the discussion, and\u0026nbspexplore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f5b6cfa3b4e3498afde846f34d0ae6d1a0b089b/0_62_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f262e51ee8a45ad2d53435ca1e3ccf31","title":"brexit parthenon marbles greece heritage","story":"The Acropolis Museum in Athens is an architectural marvel that has rightly won awards. The way the remaining Parthenon marbles are bathed in sunlight and overlooked by the temple that was their original site is profoundly beautiful. But what I found most affecting when I visited last week was the deliberate absences in the exhibits – spaces pointedly left blank for the day when, Greeks hope, the rest of the sculptures that were carved by Phidias and his assistants circa 447–438BC will be returned.In contrast, Greeks continue to care deeply, and Brexit has provided an opportunity for their government to exercise some pressure. After all, the UK government will need approval from all EU member states if a Brexit deal is reached. Rather cannily, Greece’s culture minister, Lydia Koniordou, this month sent a letter to Jeremy Wright, our culture secretary, requesting the opening of negotiations regarding the marbles. It’s ironic that, at a time when Brexit has revived the sort of jingoistic imperialism that turns many a remainer’s stomach, such symbols of British cultural chauvinism should be questioned. There are many powerful arguments for returning the marbles. I would advise anyone interested to listen to a podcast of a debate earlier this year, in which Andrew George, chair of Marbles Reunite and a Liberal Democrat MP, and the actor Stephen Fry called for the marbles to be returned to Athens. They appealed to a British sense of fair play, pointing out that it would be less a humiliating climbdown, more a gesture of friendship to Greece and its people.But the most persuasive argument came from a member of the audience, who pointed out that the Parthenon marbles were a single work of art that should not be ided. Wouldn’t it be bizarre, he argued, if the head of Michelangelo’s David was in the British Museum and the body in the Uffizi Gallery? As Greeks have been saying for years, at the moment the Parthenon marbles are like a family portrait in which loved ones are missing.One of the arguments most frequently made against returning the marbles is that the British Museum is a museum for the world hosting global treasure. By comparison, the one in Athens is insultingly portrayed as simply a national museum – despite the millions of tourists who visit the cradle of western civilisation every year. But to my mind Brexit makes such an argument totally redundant.Can the British Museum really lay claim to being a museum for the world when the British government has jettisoned freedom of movement in its Brexit negotiations? I think not. Send the Parthenon marbles back to Athens, and they are free to be viewed by any of the citizens of the European Union who should choose to travel there, free from restrictions. Furthermore, Greece would be happy to lend the marbles globally. Meanwhile, Britain can surely make do with plaster casts of the sculptures. The majority of visitors probably wouldn’t even notice, or care.There are many people who regard my generation as snowflakes for wanting to decolonise education curriculums or objecting to certain statues on university campuses. But we are also a generation of remainers firmly internationalist in outlook. For us, one of the greatest moral statements our government could make to express regret for past colonialist behaviour would be to return the Parthenon marbles to their rightful owners. They won’t, of course. Conservatism is after all a commitment to old-fashioned, traditional values. In contrast, Jeremy Corbyn says that any Labour government led by him would return the marbles. He gets it.The “slippery slope” reasoning that returning the marbles would prompt every country to ask for everything back is irrelevant – would you accept a thief hoarding stolen goods on such a basis? This is a question of doing what is right. Brexit Britain doesn’t much care about gestures of international friendship. But perhaps its hand will be forced. Whatever happens, the long-outdated case for hoarding the marbles will continue to crumble, just like plaster."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/917f93dac618043a3d03762d745e7d525a358a09/175_0_1787_1072/master/1787.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58806c7f14f9e1265b3d8be426d97490","title":"europe labour left alt right corbynites steve bannon","story":"Dotted around Labour conference in Liverpool are T-shirts bearing the slogan “Love Corbyn, Hate Brexit”, which is not an unusual combination but an increasingly unstable one. It is meant as a declaration but comes across as a plea – urging the leader to reward the devotion of his fans with a sign that he shares their pain at the prospect of leaving the European Union. He doesn’t.Jeremy Corbyn’s attitude towards Brexit is not mysterious. He was a critic of the EU before the referendum, declared himself a tepid supporter of membership during the campaign and showed not a flicker of sorrow at the result. Despite emotional aversion to Brexit among Labour members, the leader is up for leaving.Campaigners pushing for another referendum forced the issue on to the agenda in Liverpool, but in terms of policy change they got only a foot in the door. It was decided after hours of haggling that the second-vote option should be left “on the table” if the party’s preferred outcome – a general election – doesn’t materialise.Some of Corbyn’s oldest allies then made it clear that a plebiscite should exclude the option of remaining in the EU on current terms. Len McCluskey, the leader of the Unite union, and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, have both said the rival proposition to a Brexit deal would be exiting with no deal. But it is also Labour policy to “vigorously” oppose no deal and to vote against the Brexit that Theresa May is trying to negotiate. The absurd equation is that the opposition is against May’s deal, against no deal, but not against a referendum inviting people to choose between May’s deal and no deal.Much of Labour’s difficulty flows from the problem of appealing both to the current, pro-EU supporter base and a different, target electorate in constituencies that voted leave. The best defence of Corbyn’s position is that many of those Brexit backers thought they were delivering a once-in-a-generation ballot-box boot to the political class. Quitting the EU makes practical remedies harder to deliver for those people, but that is not an easy pitch. There is a noxious hauteur in telling people the thing they wanted is not what they really needed.The riposte is that politicians who see a national calamity unfolding have a patriotic duty to avert it. If voters are unpersuaded that Brexit is a mistake, the task is better persuasion, not surrender to the error. Corbyn’s most vaunted skill is meant to be evangelism. He is credited with single-handedly shifting Britain’s political centre of gravity leftward. If his magnetism really works as advertised it could surely be deployed to reorient European debate. But that never happens.The reason is not electoral calculus but allergy to defence of the status quo. There is a strain of Corbynism that is hostile to the set of postwar institutions that were bulwarks of the “west” during the cold war and, after it, upheld a hegemonic capitalist world order. In radical left demonology they are instruments of imperialist exploitation. The EU is not a prominent monster in that villainous hierarchy – it is no Nato or World Bank – but it is a member of the same extended family. It is not something leftists in the Corbyn-McDonnell-McCluskey mould instinctively defend.What makes this awkward in relations with younger and less doctrinaire Corbynites is that in 2018 the prominent challenge to that western institutional order comes from the far right. For many Labour people, Brexit was one of twin traumas in 2016, the other being Donald Trump’s election. The most effective insurgency against the European status quo today is racist and nationalistic. And so, regardless of any noble interior motive, the practical result of tagging along with an anti-EU project is tactical alignment with a wrecking enterprise that has Steve Bannon as its guru, Boris Johnson as its British proconsul and Russia as its immediate strategic beneficiary.Corbyn’s team will never recognise in themselves a symmetrical alt-left to the “alt-right” menace they revile. The two tribes envisage very different end-states. But there is between them a cultural affinity in the romantic fantasy of creative destruction a similar quickening of the pulse at the prospect of the old order crumbling. Tory Brexit-pushers and Labour Brexit-enablers both have an ear for the music of breaking glass and a shared secret: their plans require things to get worse for most people before anything would get better.None of this means that Labour’s European position is settled. The leader’s team likes power more than it dislikes the EU and is capable of pragmatism. It is mindful of the “Love Corbyn, Hate Brexit” crowd and if it looks as though pro-remain feeling is cannibalising affection for the man they call just “Jeremy”, he will shift.But there is also a looming scenario in which the UK crashes out of the EU, causing chaos and misery, for which the Tories get all the blame. Labour then scoops up the votes of the immiserated. It isn’t a position that anyone around Corbyn will express out loud because it sounds brutal and cynical: no one will trumpet a plan of complicity with Conservative no-deal maniacs to engineer a crisis in the hope of capitalising on public pain. The Tory right and Labour left are supposed to be miles apart on the spectrum, diametrically opposed foes. But that doesn’t mean they have nothing in common – only that they have no interest in drawing attention to the common ground between them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28d520274bb6453fc3b1d2158babc8a8fb742484/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=506714d7f916b8044c3152bf8ade02fa","title":"republican party face wrath women","story":"Women aren’t just mad – they’re organized and mobilized politically in a way we’ve never quite seen beforeIf there’s cause for hope in these horror-show days, it’s this: The Republican party has no idea what’s about to hit it this November.Even the dimmest and most misogynist of Republican operatives must realize, by this point, that the supreme court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh and the handling of the sexual assault allegations against him will hurt their chances, especially with women voters, in the upcoming midterm elections.What they don’t seem to realize, though, is that huge numbers of women aren’t just mad – they’re organized and mobilized politically in a way we’ve never quite seen before. The key story of the midterms is the large number of progressive women – and to a lesser extent, progressive men – who have been taking on the crucial, unglamorous work that swings elections: registering voters, canvassing door-to-door, preparing to get people to the polls. The disdain for women that the Republicans have shown by continuing to rally behind Kavanaugh is only energizing them further.The anguish and courage reflected in the cascade of #WhyIDidntReport stories is deeply personal, but the fallout is sure to be directly political. Well before the president who has been repeatedly accused of sexual assault nominated a man now repeatedly accused of sexual assault to a lifetime position on the highest court in the land, women were laying the groundwork for a historic political reckoning this fall. Of course there are women, mainly white women, who retain their allegiance to the Republican party their ranks, though, are very unlikely to expand. By contrast, the rage of millions of women, including overwhelming majorities of women of color, is now laser-focused on the Republican party – and there’s a robust grassroots infrastructure in place to make sure it is expressed at the ballot box this November.Ever since Donald Trump took the oath of office, the wrath of women has found expression in a remarkable growth of activism and grassroots organizing. When millions of Americans joined the Women’s Marches around the country in January 2017, the outpouring was a harbinger of what was to come: a multi-issue, women-led upsurge of political engagement on an unprecedented scale. Nearly 25,000 protests have taken place since Trump’s inauguration, involving somewhere between 14 and 21 million Americans. These figures greatly exceed levels of protest participation at any prior time in US history, even the height of the Vietnam war. And no matter the issue or focus of the demonstrations, women have consistently been the majority of those taking to the streets.Protests are only the most visible manifestation of what’s been happening at the grassroots, however. Quietly and persistently, women have also been pursuing a powerful electoral ground game that’s striking in both its scale and its character. During some past eras in American history when demonstrations surged, there was a gulf between protest politics and electoral activism, with those who marched in the streets shunning electoral work as impossibly compromised. That gulf has utterly vanished in the Trump era, with a clear-eyed pragmatism taking its place: “Voting,” one activist friend likes to say, “is a form of harm reduction.”If the resistance movements of our time have rejected the kind of outsider purity that kept some of their predecessors sidelined from electoral engagement, they are also strikingly independent of the Democratic party, which as a whole has been all too unwilling to translate anti-Trump rhetoric into muscular action. Substantial mobilizing for the midterms is being done through the vast array of local grassroots groups that formed after Trump took office, including the 5,000 groups affiliated with Inisible. Like the resistance to Trump more generally, these groups are typically women-led and have already played a key role in a series of progressive electoral upsets, including Doug Jones’s Senate victory in Alabama last December to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s highly publicized primary win this past June. Their autonomy from the Democratic party gives much of their work an under-the-radar quality that can obscure their impact one New York Times write-up of their role in the November 2017 special elections in Virginia disparaged them as “inchoate volunteer armies” even as it gave them substantial credit for Democrats’ success.The anger surrounding Brett Kavanaugh and the Republican leaders determined to “plow right through” with his nomination will only make those volunteer armies grow in both size and significance. Republicans have galvanized a backlash that will have profound electoral consequences. Women’s anger is often thought of as uncontrolled, as “dangerous and unhinged”, as Soraya Chemaly writes in Rage Becomes Her, one of several important new books that examine the meaning and contours of women’s wrath."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c60f6cd03c5c089861f9e11f2f0710cfda80bba0/171_115_2285_1371/master/2285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3725b8b0137d07e5da3978e913c91a9b","title":"ebb and flow britains tidal coastline in pictures","story":"Photographers David Levene and Christopher Thomond picked spots around Britain’s coastline at high and low tideby  David Levene and  Christopher Thomond Words by  Patrick BarkhamThe tide is a long wave. The vertical movement of water pulled by a constellation of air pressure, wind, topography, the sun and the elliptical orbit of the moon is rarely visible to the naked eye. Instead we see the impact of this irrepressible force on our coastline roughly every six hours, when the tide is high and when it is low.The British coast has some of the mightiest tides in the world – the Bristol Channel has the second biggest rise and fall after Nova Scotia – and two  photographers, David Levene and Christopher Thomond, spent much of the summer exploring how the tide’s ebb and flow reveals different worlds.Arnside in Lancashire. Photographs: Christopher ThomondThomond relied on his naked eye to line up each high- and low-tide image. “I found them quite a struggle – technically it was difficult to line the two pictures up in your head,” he admits. “I’d find a vantage point at low tide and come back eight hours later and the markers I had in my head to line up the image had disappeared.”Thomond says people probably imagine taking pictures of tides at beautiful coastline spots to be a rather lovely holiday job, but the reality was he had to squeeze in the work between more mundane tasks. The “pure practicalities” – particularly getting two pictures in good light – overtook any pleasure in admiring the liminal world revealed and then covered by the tide, he says. “I didn’t choose a view, set up the tripod, wait for six hours and take another picture. I shot five or six scenes from the same area and tried to get some variety and replicate each one. You could never quite predict how somewhere was going to look at high tide.”Fossil hunting at Lyme Regis, Dorset. Photographs: David LeveneLevene tried to begin with a compelling low-tide picture. The biggest challenge was obtaining the high-tide picture of Lyme Regis on one of the hottest days of the year. He took the low-tide image of fossil hunters from the top of a fragment of eroding cliff that was only accessible at low tide. “I then had to wake at the crack of dawn, come down with a coffee and suncream and walk out at low tide and wait for the high tide, so I was sat out there in the heatwave for about eight hours.”The Wash from Snettisham, Norfolk. Photographs: David LeveneLevene was often too busy trying different photographic positions or checking tidal apps to experience the meditative beauty of the ebb and flow of the tide. But he was moved by the unexpected drama of the North Sea flooding over great expanse of the Wash at Snettisham.“The way that the water came in through the mudflats was just amazing,” he says. “It takes forever to come in but for the last 40 minutes the channels suddenly fill up. I was taking pictures all the while.”Taking the photographs from exactly the same position was sometimes unexpectedly difficult. Levene imagined he might mark the spot for his tripod and return six hours later, but in often busy places or natural beaches it wasn’t possible to leave a durable mark.Instead he used his eye. “You’ve got to fidget yourself into the right position by looking at the original picture you’ve taken and use reference points from it,” he says. To get a really precise match, Levene also plugged his camera into his computer at his tide-watching spot to overlay the original picture with the new image revealed by the camera.Crosby beach in Merseyside.

But what about those left behind?Only half-jokingly, some residents of a progressive city 300 miles north of the Mexican border have adopted the “build the wall” slogan in the face of a wave of newcomers. But these perceived interlopers are starkly different from Donald Trump’s imagination.They are American, mainly white and are fleeing the unlivable heat.Arizona’s vast sweep of landscapes stretches from the scorched western movie backdrop of the Sonoran desert in the south, past rusty red sandstone outcrops further north in Sedona until you ascend to Flagstaff, a pleasant city carved into the largest expanse of ponderosa pine trees in the world, at an elevation of 7,000ft.Flagstaff, population 70,000, has long been a destination for people in southern Arizona looking for a cooling respite in summer or a spot of skiing on the nearby San Francisco Peaks in winter.But rising temperatures, driven by human-induced climate change, mean that many in Flagstaff fret they are now being overrun by those fleeing sweltering cities such as Phoenix and Tucson. A pattern of climate-driven gentrification is taking hold across the US, as those who are able to retreat from floods, storms, heatwaves and wildfires shift to safer areas, bringing soaring property and rental values with them.“We don’t talk much about what climate change means for social justice. But where are low-income people going to live? How can they afford to stay in this city?”There are usually a tangle of reasons – jobs, love, education – as to why people decide to move, but Flagstaff’s agreeable climate is jostling towards the front. Last summer, Phoenix was so hot that road signs and mailboxes melted. Planes couldn’t take off or land. On a recent July day this year, when Phoenix hit 116F (47C), Flagstaff, a two-hour drive and a world away, was 80F (27C).Amanda Ormond moved to Phoenix in 1985, first working in bars after leaving college before becoming a clean energy consultant.“If you choose to live in the desert you have to learn how to live in the desert,” Ormond said. “You worry about your car breaking down and so you have tons of food and water in it.“But the heat used to break around September. Now, it’s October, sometimes November. We literally have six months of above 90F (32C). Mentally, you need a break. You can’t leave your house. It’s fatiguing.”Ormond still owns her house in Tempe, which adjoins Phoenix. “We had this home and when I look around I think ‘I just can’t see how this is gonna be a good investment for 20 years with climate change.’”Phoenicians able to move, or even vacation, in cooler climes such as Flagstaff are usually older and wealthier. Those who still work can often do so remotely. The influx has aroused concerns in Flagstaff, where rents and property values have soared.“The tenor in the town is ‘Stop building. Build a wall,’” said Jenny Niemann, a climate and energy specialist at the city of Flagstaff. “People joke about that. But I think it’s fair to say the town feels incredibly stressed by the increasing prices, as well as the development.”While the western US is increasingly baked by heatwaves and choked by smoke from wildfires, the pressing concern in eastern states is that their coasts are being redrawn by sea level rise and pummeled by ever-stronger hurricanes. More than 300,000 homes near US coasts face being chronically flooded within 30 years.This unfolding scenario is reshaping previous lines of segregation in coastal cities. As investors shift capital to higher ground and shoreline properties become costlier in terms of insurance and repairs, low- to middle-income people are squeezed out from both areas.A recent study of the greater Miami area shows this process is already under way – properties at high elevations are experiencing rising values, while those situated just 3ft above sea level have declined in value, even when other factors are accounted for. This trend has largely taken hold since 2000.“It’s a pretty clear signal and there’s evidence it’s happening across the US,” said Jesse Keenan, a climate adaptation expert at Harvard who authored the Miami report. “The very wealthy can afford to throw money away but moderate- to low-income people can’t, so there’s an inequality to living immediately on the coast.”According to Keenan, climate gentrification is not just a supply problem – real estate developers actively marketing elevated areas as safe investments – but also a demand one – buyers are starting to swarm to higher ground.“This is happening neighborhood to neighborhood, city to city, state to state,” he said. “It’s such a huge spectrum of geography that we are going to have make moral judgments about what to protect and what to let go. There’s not enough money to protect everyone. We need a complete mobilization, similar to the effort of putting a man on the moon, to adapt our coasts.”Residents of the Miami districts of Liberty City and Little Haiti, traditionally African American and Hiic areas, are seeing their neighborhoods transform around them. The districts, which sit a relatively safe 15ft above sea level, are currently having holes punched into them by bulldozers to make way for half a dozen apartment developments.“We are already seeing low-income homes and businesses being evicted, the new developments are popping up everywhere,” said Valencia Gunder, a Liberty City resident turned activist who grew up hearing warnings about gentrification that are now being realized.Previously blighted by poverty and crime, Liberty City is now seen as an attractive base for those worried their beachfront properties will soon be swamped. In 2000, no one in Liberty City paid more than $1,000 a month in rent – now it’s roughly one in six. Property prices have also risen sharply.“People are being forced out to places like Georgia and Alabama, where it’s more affordable,” said Gunder. “It’s becoming so expensive. These developers aren’t making Liberty City better for the people who already live here.”Even cities with cerebral approaches to climate change are at risk of upheavals that cut deepest in poorer, minority communities. Norfolk, Virginia, has reacted to some of the fastest sea level rises in the world with an ambitious plan that cedes some territory to the tides, while breaking up some housing projects and relocating residents. Local activists worry this will mean low-income, black communities will be displaced as their coastal neighborhoods are gentrified.“This is a red alarm issue,” said Mustafa Ali, who spent 25 years at the Environmental Protection Agency’s office of environmental justice. “We need to make better decisions around resilience and vulnerable communities need to be brought into that conversation. A whole lot of folks are being left behind.”Flagstaff also faces its own climate change threats – increased wildfires in the surrounding Coconino national forest, the associated risk of flooding rains washing freely down treeless slopes on to the city, pressure on the water supply. Growing numbers of homeless people are traveling to Flagstaff to camp in the woods, heightening local fears over unintended conflagration.Antonopoulos, who has helped develop a draft climate plan for Flagstaff to confront this new reality, recalls the sky turning black from ash after the nearby Schultz fire, in 2010. “I was walking to work with a bandanna on and literally chunks of burning trees were falling everywhere,” she said. “When we’ve got climate refugees it’s going to put more stress not only on our infrastructure but also our natural resources.”The hand of climate change is everywhere – from water availability to insurance markets to housing pricing – while rarely being identified as a culprit. As temperatures continue to escalate, prior inequities are likely to be exacerbated, injustices risk deepening.“Whether it’s happening already is unclear but I think more and more people are going to be moving because of climate change,” said Brian Petersen, a climate change and planning academic at Northern Arizona University.“The people marginalized already in society will bear the brunt of this. Poor people in Las Vegas or Phoenix who can’t get away from the heat are not going to be leaving to go to beautiful, expensive mountain towns.”Even those who do make it to Flagstaff and other refuges, such as Oregon or near the Great Lakes, won’t be shielded from the transforming climate.

Gonzalez is also the principal climate change scientist for the US National Park Service but conducted and spoke about the research in his university capacity.They are particularly vulnerable because most US park land is in areas that are heating up quicker: in the mountains, the Arctic and the dry south-west.Gonzalez explained that parks at a higher elevation have a thinner atmosphere that warms faster. Hotter temperatures are also melting snow cover and making the ground darker so that it absorbs more heat. Parks in California and the south-west US have seen both high temperatures and record-low rainfall, he said.The research is the first comprehensive look at climate change impacts on national parks, Gonzalez said. He said he has been using the climate impacts research to develop plans for parks to adapt and reduce the greenhouse gas pollution they contribute.The Trump administration has rescinded government efforts to slow climate change. The interior department, where the National Park Service is housed, nixed a policy that would have urged management decisions based on science, including climate change research. Park officials in New England scrubbed references to climate change and flooding risks in a report this summer, according to Reveal. The National Park Service did not immediately respond to a request to comment on the study or climate change policies for parks.Jonathan Jarvis, the National Park Service director under Barack Obama who now also works at UC Berkeley, said he relied on climate change projections to decide where to relocate and bolster structures in the Everglades national park in Florida, an area that has been hit by hurricanes and faces sea-level rise.Jarvis said he worries that under Trump parks won’t be able to plan long-term for climate change.“The park service manages these assets, these places, for the benefit of the American people, and they should be based on the best available sound science in the long-term public interest, not for some short-term political agenda,” Jarvis said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d685c49e2dcf37a7272319329592df12ebf1ef4/0_332_3508_1712/master/3508.jpg?width=980\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ae5d698db2e0b3581c14c3716f38a211 1960w","title":"kevin keegan no im not going to take a compliment from mike ashley","story":"The former England captain shares memories of Bobby Moore and George Best, his regrets about managing Newcastle and England and why if he was a player today he’d like to turn out for Jürgen Klopp’s LiverpoolYou can feel the energy as soon as Kevin Keegan walks into the room – barrel chest, big biceps, warm smile, small man, tough handshake. His hair is white these days, the perm long gone, and his belly more rounded, but otherwise he is little changed. Keegan is as passionate and outspoken as he ever was.We meet in a hotel in Manchester. It’s funny that he’s written another memoir, he says, because he hates looking back. “I don’t like player reunions because all you get is the lads talking about whatever year you won something. A lot of them are just lost in that. Sir John Hall had a saying: ‘If you live in the past, you die in the past.’ You’ve got to reinvent yourself – try to move on.”He might not have much time for reminiscing, but with Keegan there is always a significant career anniversary to mark. So it’s 50 years since he made his debut for Scunthorpe United, 45 since he claimed the first of his three league titles with Liverpool, 40 since he won the first of two successive European Player of the Year awards at Hamburg, 25 since the season he managed Newcastle United to the first ision title, 20 next February since he was named England manager, and 10 since he walked out on Newcastle United for the second time (his last job in management).Few Englishmen have played and managed with such raw emotion. Keegan is a fascinating, and contradictory, character – one of the most decent, reliable and transparent men in football, yet at the same time short-fused, unpredictable and inscrutable. He has always been one of football’s great believers by nature an optimist and idealist. The flip side is a zero tolerance of cheats, bullshitters, and at times, you sense, even of himself.His book opens with him returning to St James’ Park in disguise after falling out with owner Mike Ashley who he felt had made him persona non grata. His second time managing Newcastle United was a horror show. Things came to a head in 2008 after discovering Ashley’s cronies had bought the Spaniard Xisco for £5.7m despite never having seen him play, and signed the Uruguayan Ignacio González on loan as a “favour” to two South American agents.When Keegan went ballistic he was told not to worry, he could just “park” González – he didn’t even have to play him in the reserves. Keegan quit, and was awarded £2m for constructive dismissal by a tribunal in 2009. I tell him I felt sickened when I read about the culture at the club. Yes, Keegan says, but Ashley’s Newcastle are not representative of modern football they are the worst of the worst. “They are a real one-off. I don’t know of a club that has been run as badly or with such disregard for people.”Ironically, Ashley called Keegan “the most honest man in football”. Does he accept that compliment? He smiles. “No, I’m not going to take a compliment from Mike Ashley.”Keegan has never been able to stay shtum when he sees slights and injustices. In the new book, pacily ghosted by the ’s Daniel Taylor, he doesn’t hold back. So he calls out Brian Clough for bullying, Alex Ferguson for gamesmanship, the FA for not supporting him as England manager, Bobby Robson for not telling him why he was dropping him from the England squad, Lawrie McMenemy for suggesting he was not trying in a Southampton match and calling his team cheats (for Keegan, the worst accusation you could make), Liverpool for their arrogance, Manchester City for their parsimony. And, of course, he doesn’t hold back on himself. After all, this is the man who said he wasn’t up to managing England and promptly quit.In his book The Chimp Paradox the psychiatrist Steve Peters says too much emotion is often the ruin of an athlete. It has certainly got the better of Keegan at times – when he got sent off for scrapping with Leeds United’s Billy Bremner in the 1974 Charity Shield the famous finger-jabbing “I will love it” rant when Newcastle were challenging Manchester United for the Premier League title and he allowed Ferguson’s mind-games to get the better of him. But it’s also been the making of him.Did she ever get upset with his impetuousness? “Jean used to say to me I was mad. She’d say: ‘You should have stayed there,’ but she knows that’s not for me.”Why has he left so many jobs? “I don’t like people to deceive me and tell me lies.” He taps the table and goes straight on to his next bete noire – clubs that lack ambition. Say the word “consolidate” to Keegan and he’ll head straight for the door – as happened with Manchester City. “If you’re not going forward, what’s the point in sticking around? If the chairman says we’re looking forward to consolidate, that’s the time for you to say as a manager we’ll go backwards.”George Best, a friend, said that as a player Keegan wasn’t fit to lace his boots. And in a way he was right. But what Keegan had was a ferocious determination. He chased like a terrier, ran defenders ragged, beat giant defenders in the air despite being only 5ft 7in, and willed himself into being one of the footballing greats. No player exceeded his potential like Keegan. He captained England 33 times and succeeded wherever he played – top scorer in the league at Southampton in 1982, a hero when he retired, helicoptered away from the adoring Newcastle fans at St James’ Park after his final game like the statue of Christ in La Dolce Vita. Keegan is the only British player to have won two Ballons d’Or.He admits he was the beneficiary of Best’s boozed-up unreliability. When Best didn’t turn up for gigs, they were passed on to Keegan. There were Keegan newspaper columns, Keegan football boots, even a Keegan hit record (Head Over Heels in Love).He adored Best. “I wanted so much to have his ability. His skill was unbelievable. I played against Cruyff, Beckenbauer, Maradona. But I still say Besty was the best I played against.”He has little time for those who say Best threw his life away. “I didn’t ever have anything other than maximum respect for Besty. He loved his life. He never left anything behind. He had a great life. He did all the things he wanted to do and nobody was going to stop him. That was his character.”Given that Keegan was not the most naturally gifted footballer, is he surprised by how much he achieved? “Yes, amazing really. I look at the players who have won the Ballon d’Or, right back to Stanley Matthews. You’ve got players in there like Platini and Cruyff. Then you see my name there twice!”I ask Keegan what has given him most happiness in football. He doesn’t mention the trophies or personal achievements. “Bobby Moore leading me out for England, with Alf Ramsey as manager. That was unbelievable. Bobby Moore saying when I joined the England squad: ‘We’re going out tonight, be down at seven’, and he had a big red Jag and took eight or 10 of us into town to a club. It would be illegal now. That was very special.” He looks emotional, just thinking about it. “Nothing beat playing for England for me. Being made captain, leading your team out. We never did great in my time, but that’s probably the happiest it gets.”But he has few happy memories of his time as England manager. Keegan lasted 20 months and 18 games, winning only seven of them – the worst win ratio of any England manager, and his one true failure in football. Why did he say he wasn’t up to the job when he quit? “I wasn’t. I didn’t like it – that’s another way of putting it. I like everyday team‑building with players. People say, ‘Well tactically you weren’t very good’, but tactically what can you do with players when you don’t have them?”I mention he has never been sacked as a manager. Keegan drums his fingers on the table. “I would have been sacked as England manager after the Germany game. I’d already been told by the FA that results had to improve. So I just made it easy for them. But yeah, I walked away from a lot of money if that’s what you’re saying.”Despite England reaching the semi-final of this year’s World Cup, he still believes the job is a poisoned chalice. Is it a big ask for Gareth Southgate to take England further forward? “Well, I think it is because I’m sure if you got Gareth in a room and said truthfully did you expect to get this far, he’d say no … He’s got the same problem that England have had for a long time since Gazza went. Where’s your Eden Hazard, your David Silva, your De Bruyne? Where are they? There’s an orchestra there, but nobody to conduct.”Actually, he says, for England to succeed long term, Southgate would have to be a miracle-worker. He believes Southgate’s biggest challenge is that many squad members are not even regulars in their team. “There’s the miracle he’s got to work whereby he’s got players sat on benches watching players, and expect them to play against those players who are playing every week and have leadership roles in the team.” And he talks about the other problems – the reluctance of the big clubs to give English kids a chance despite nurturing them in their academies the failure to appoint successful English managers such as Eddie Howe to the top jobs, the exaltation of foreign managers who park the bus and are called defensive maestros. “‘It’s a Mourinho masterclass.’ I get the feeling if that had been me or Sam Allardyce ... ppfff, we wouldn’t get away with it.”Keegan has always seemed content in his prolonged periods away from football. “I miss the banter with players as a manager. I miss playing, but I’ve been missing that for 34 years. Nothing beats playing. Management is just a way of staying in the game you love for a bit longer …” He grins. “And sometimes very short periods.”In his book, he points out that Winston Churchill was 76 when he began his second term as prime minister. Could Keegan be tempted back for one final stint in management? “I have had opportunities, that’s for sure. I don’t think it’s going to happen, but when you say that you’ve got to be careful … because if someone came in like Sir John Hall did and said, ‘You’ve got the passion, I’ve got the money’, you think, ‘Wow, we could do something there’.” He is juggling the possibilities in his head. “I’m 67, almost 68,” he says, apparently writing himself off. But a second later there’s a glint in his eye. “I wouldn’t be the oldest manager!”Kevin Keegan: My Life in Football will be published by Macmillan on 4 October, £20."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebaf71751920ea186549e4c72736d7a7003faebd/0_305_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b244c2a37548ace43cb447b2c36a05a","title":"mls ultras fans supporters groups","story":"Football in North America has been on a quest for authenticity for decades. It’s debatable whether hardcore fans are helping or hindering that goalWhen Major League Soccer kicked off for the first time back in 1996, European football’s Ultras culture was just about winding down. Of course, Ultras still exist to this day, but the height of football’s sometimes violent, always notorious, counterculture came in the 1980s when English and Italian fans earned a toxic reputation. As in many things, though, MLS has spent the past few years catching up.The game in North America has fostered a fan culture of its own. You can see it in the fanbases of the Portland Timbers, Seattle Sounders, Orlando City, Atlanta United, LAFC and more, but there are loud and proud pure Ultras groups too. Groups like Inebriatti in Canada, who last month were banned by Toronto FC for causing mayhem at a game in Ottawa. They lit smoke bombs and tossed flares on to the pitch while wearing masks, alarming other fans in the stadium. They won’t be at another Toronto FC game any time soon.Inebriatti aren’t the only Ultras group to have been banned by the team they follow, with the Garden State Ultras’ recognition as an official supporters group of the New York Red Bulls revoked earlier this year following numerous complaints from other fans, stadium employees and even police. Sector Latino, a Chicago Fire Ultras group, were also kicked out of their seats in June.Ultras culture in MLS persists, though. But why? What drives so many to align themselves with a way of fandom that is commonly seen as a vestige of a bygone age? What’s really behind this rise of Ultras culture in MLS?Some believe it’s down to perceptions, that to be viewed as authentic, whatever that truly means, they must adopt the most hardcore aspects of European and South American fandom. This, it seems, is what leads so many to Ultras culture. And to violence, the most lamentable aspect of Ultras culture. Hooliganism is frowned upon by the majority, but to the minority it is synonymous with football and a symbol of true fandom.But in looking for authenticity, some MLS Ultras oddly come across as plastic. “That Ultras behaviour has slowly penetrated the sporting landscape here, but I wouldn’t call them real Ultras in any way,” says Ben Glidden of The Third Rail, an officially recognised New York City FC supporters’ group. “They’re really just seeking attention. In their minds, if you don’t have ‘Ultras’ at your club, then you’re not a real club. It’s ridiculous.”The Third Rail might not class themselves as Ultras, but NYC FC has witnessed some Ultras moments over their short history as a club. In 2017, for instance, some fans ripped seats from Orlando City Stadium during a season opener, with arrests also made for fighting in the streets around the ground that same year.Then there was the brawling that occurred between NYC FC fans and Red Bulls fans before a Hudson River Derby in 2015, when a pre-match melee ensued in a Newark bar. These scenes, and the mockney chants of “Who are ya?”, were widely derided as the work of wannabes posturing for the day. “You see that in other American sports all the time in parking lots after games, though,” says Glidden, casting his mind back to that particular scuffle. “That’s not Ultras.”Some groups, like the San Jose Ultras, are still in the good books of the clubs they follow. But even they can feel somewhat under the thumb. “MLS is very restrictive when it comes to support. It’s definitely not the best environment for any type of organic, natural support,” says the San Jose Ultras’ Dan Margarit, who grew up in Europe. “In my opinion, those groups being banned is a blessing in disguise for their members. They all have much more freedom to do what they want now, because there is no accountability.”Ultras come with negative connotations. They are associated with violence, chaos and making stadiums a more intimidating place to be. That latter point might not be seen as a crime, given that all teams want to make their home stadiums a more difficult place for visiting teams to play, but MLS’s matchday experience is vastly different to the kind generally seen in Europe and South America. That’s maybe why Ultras’ presence at games is so jarring to some.Echoing the sentiments of both Margarit and the leader of the GSU, MLS clubs themselves control the supporter scene in a way European and South American clubs don’t. In many cases, supporters groups are baked into the very existence of the clubs themselves – see the Sons of Ben and the Philadelphia Union. Back in 2013, when MLS tried to prevent fans from chanting abuse at games, the New York Red Bulls offered the three official supporters groups they had at the time $500 a game to keep things PG13. Two accepted that offer, but the GSU did not. They wanted to keep the edge that ultimately led to their exile.It could be argued that the creation of Ultras groups are a rebellion against this controlled environment, explaining why MLS has dipped its toe into Ultras culture later than most other leagues around world soccer. MLS Ultras groups might not be political in the way many European Ultras groups are, but they are political in their stance against the league-dictated status quo.Many Ultras ideas borrowed by MLS fans have improved the league’s culture. No league does tifos like MLS, for instance. MLS’s “safe standing” sections recall the way Ultras used to stand and sway as one living, breathing entity in European terraces decades ago. Orlando City even have safe pyrotechnics zones in their stadium.“As long as MLS grows and attracts more fans, the supporter landscape is going to cover the whole spectrum,” says Austin Long of Atlanta United supporters group Terminus Legion. “You have casual fans who go to one or two games a year and that goes all the way to the Ultras who are there to pick a fight. Most of the groups are there in the middle. As the league grows, it’s just going to be part of it.”That could be it. MLS now boasts an average attendance in line with many of Europe’s leagues (the league’s average attendance is higher than both France’s Ligue 1 and Netherlands’ Ereisie) and with that popularity comes a variety and ersity in fandom. The question might not be whether MLS can do without Ultras, but whether their total banishment is even an option."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/577ff3f1a93c3d38b59bd1c9f625e566962e105b/822_142_4647_2788/master/4647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ab3c064db431c9bd4d94f1c44946780","title":"oxford cameron norman manchester city kings lynn norwich carabao cup","story":"Five months ago the right-back was at King’s Lynn. Now a Carabao Cup test against the Premier League champions awaitsOf all the ways to react to “a massive blow”, Cameron Norman chose the best. That is why he can expect to play for Oxford United against Manchester City in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday, a reality that makes for a pleasing alternative to where he was only a few months ago, serving as right-back for King’s Lynn Town in the Evo-Stik League South, the seventh tier of English football.Norman found himself at that level after being released last year by Norwich City, which had been his football home since the age of eight. He had shown great promise – playing a big role in Norwich’s victory in the 2013 FA Youth Cup final over a Chelsea team featuring Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Andreas Christensen – but he was discarded having reached 21 without making a senior appearance.“I obviously didn’t agree with it, even if I kind of understood, but I had to pick myself up quickly because I knew I didn’t have time to waste,” he says. “I had to prove myself to get back.”King’s Lynn were managed at the time by the former Norwich player Ian Culverhouse, who was well aware of Norman’s potential. The full-back joined on a non-contract basis in order to keep his options open. “I had an understanding with the chairman because I had aspirations to go higher,” he explains. “But at the same time I didn’t want to take the first thing that came along, especially after things started going so well at King’s Lynn. So around Christmas I went to the chairman and fully committed myself to them.“I wanted to complete the season and see how well I could do, you know, how many goals and assists I could get.” He did exceptionally well, finishing with 11 goals and 26 assists, an almost preposterous return for a right-back, albeit one who prides himself on his deliveries from open play and free-kicks.“It’s a competitive level, that’s the best way to put it,” says Norman of the Evo-Stik League. “There are good players in the league, a lot of guys in similar situations to the one I was in.” As a part-time outfit King’s Lynn trained only two or three times per week but Norman did more. “I’d go to the gym every day, doing double sessions, trying to keep my professional standards up so that on Saturday there was a clear difference in playing ability,” he says. “It’s tough to keep going every single day when you don’t have to, especially over Christmas. But I can look back now and think: ‘Good job I did that.’”Robinson’s first-choice right-back at the start of this season was another new signing, the former Bradford City player Tony McMahon. But Norman was given a game in the first round of the Carabao Cup, a win over Coventry City, and the following week, at the age of 22, he finally made his Football League debut in a 3-2 defeat by Accrington Stanley.“It was as long time coming but I definitely felt like I was ready for it,” he says. “My family all came to watch because it was a big achievement considering where I was playing a year ago. But I trained well and the manager stuck to his word and I’m in the team now. Hopefully I can stay there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1629ce5c657dc351bdf47797200e9c10f3e77c3/81_306_928_557/master/928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9098efd983a301c6ac3a92758ab85cf","title":"david squires on no country for proper football men","story":"Our cartoonist on the latest chapter of a season that seems to so far have been exclusively of interest to Liverpool fans"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0fdcd38006ba7bc80140e8ded7974aabd86cf56/0_327_7360_4418/master/7360.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ff78b602b8685ca57ae4394c5e5ef73f","title":"truth about polyamory monogamy open relationships","story":"More and more young people are abandoning monogamy in favour of open relationships. But is it really that easy to turn your back on jealousy? And what about all the admin?Alex Sanson is nervous. She is hosting a dinner party this Friday, and wants it to go well, because her lovers are coming – all of them. “Cooking for one person you fancy is hard enough, but three of them is even more stressful!” says Sanson, who has brown hair, an open, friendly face and a bookish air..Sanson is polyamorous, meaning that she has multiple romantic and sexual partners, all of whom are aware of the others’ existence. Currently, the 28-year-old is in a “polycule” with three other people: William, Mike and Laura, all of whom are also dating the other members of the polycule.Dinner-party jitters aside, things are going swimmingly for Sanson, who works in marketing. “There’s so much joy in being poly,” she says. “It’s lovely not to burden one person with all your stuff. You just spread it all out.”Polyamory, also known as consensual non-monogamy, seems to be growing in popularity among young people, though with no definitive figures it’s hard to know how much of this is a matter of increased visibility. It comes in many shapes and forms, from open relationships (where in layperson’s terms you “cheat” on your partner, but they are aware and do not mind, and do the same to you), to solo polyamory, where you identify as polyamorous, but are not currently in multiple relationships. But all those involved reject monogamy as stifling, or oppressive, or simply not to their taste.“It’s not as complicated as people make it sound,” Sanson insists. If you are unsure whether polyamory might suit you, try this simple thought experiment: does the thought of your partner in the first flushes of romantic ardour with another person fill you with contentment, lust, indifference, or murderous rage? If it’s the last one, best to swerve polyamory. (There’s a term for the warm feeling polyamorous people experience when seeing their partners with someone else: compersion.)“I’ve had people saying to me, ‘You just want to fuck about!’” says 29-year-old Calum James, who identifies as a heteroflexible pansexual solo polyamorous relationship anarchist. What this basically means is that James, who is mostly straight, is not currently in a polyamorous relationship with a person or persons. If he were, he would regard it as no more important than non-intimate friendships, because relationship anarchists treat romantic and non-romantic relationships the same.“I had one woman have a go at me, saying, ‘It’s an awful way to treat women,’” James says. “But people don’t understand it’s not just about meeting women and having sex with them. I want to build deep connections with people and see them regularly. I just don’t want those connections to follow the same rules as traditional relationships.”James tried monogamy, but found it “suffocating”. “I never understood monogamy, even when I was a kid. I’d think, ‘I fancy three people in my class.’”“The thing I’ve always disliked about monogamy and marriage,” Sanson adds, “is the idea of owning another person and them being your other half or somehow completing you, like you weren’t complete before you met them. What I love about polyamory is that I’m my own person and no one owns me. I don’t own any of you, either. We’re all free.”Polyamory is having a cultural moment right now, with celebrities such as Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith speaking about being non-monogamous, and the BBC drama Wanderlust depicting a middle-class couple as they open up their relationship. As anyone who lived through the 1960s, or who is from the LGBT community will tell you, polyamory is not new: free love or non-monogamy has been practised for years. But polyamory is now being adopted by people who might have been monogamous five or 10 years ago, not least because the internet makes it easier than ever for poly-curious people to educate themselves about polyamory, and connect with like-minded iniduals.“Things are changing rapidly,” says Janet Hardy, the co-author of the polyamory handbook The Ethical Slut. “More people are getting the idea that it’s possible to be happy and healthy without being monogamous. What I’m seeing among young people is that they don’t have the same need to self-define by what they like to do in bed, or in relationships, like my generation did. Everything’s out on a big buffet, and they try a little of everything.”Polyamorous people reject the end game of romantic monogamy, and disdain so-called “relationship escalators”: society’s expectation that couples will cycle through #putaringonit selfies, marriage and kids. Instead, they let their relationships flow whither the current takes them, relinquishing themselves to the whorls and eddies that change all romantic partnerships over time. In our increasingly precarious times, it makes sense that polyamory is popular. “Growing up, you’re bombarded by all this messaging about what the perfect relationship set-up is,” Sanson says. “You’re going to have a family and buy a house and do this and that. But a lot of that isn’t relevant to my generation.”Still, being polyamorous isn’t just a carefree romp. It requires you to unpick the messy yarn of human emotion, and that most familiar knot of all: jealousy. Perhaps the biggest myth of all about polyamorous people is that they don’t feel jealousy. “Jealousy is a part of human nature,” says 27-year-old William Jeffrey, a member of Sanson’s polycule. “You still feel it. But I’ve found with every jealousy I’ve ever had while being polyamorous, I’ve been able to trace the jealousy back to an insecurity about myself. When I figure out what the insecurity is, I can overcome it.”A responsible polyamorous partner accepts the other person’s jealousy. “When I started dating someone else, my partner Laura expressed that she was feeling jealous,” says Mike Scoins, 28, also in the polycule. “So I told her: ‘I acknowledge your feelings. Can we unpack the fear that is underlying your jealousy?’ In this instance, it was something along the lines of: ‘Do you still care about me?’ When you provide reassurance that, yes, absolutely, I do still care, the jealousy dissipates.”Is jealousy only ever the result of insecurity? “I’d say that’s too simplistic a view,” says Hardy. “I don’t think there’s one emotion you can call jealousy. I think jealousy is an umbrella we put over all of the emotions we find difficult that we want to quell by changing someone else’s behaviour.” In her introduction-to-polyamory workshops, Hardy asks participants to write a thank-you note to their jealousy. “It exists for a reason. Jealousy tries to protect you from something.”Can you really vanquish the green-eyed monster with introspection and communication alone? “Some people are more prone to jealousy, and some people are less prone to it,” Hardy says. “If polyamory sounds unpleasant, don’t do it! There are no merit badges here.”“I don’t really experience sexual jealousy,” Scoins muses. “My one experience of jealousy was when my then partner had two tickets for a ball and didn’t give me one.”There’s a joke about polyamory: it didn’t take off until Google Calendar was invented. The polyamorous people I interview effortlessly manage packed schedules. Jeffrey, for instance, will meet once a week to play a Buffy the Vampire Slayer role-playing game with Scoins and the fourth member of their polycule, Laura Nevo. He also has a weekly date night with his live-in partner, as well as seeing Sanson and Nevo once a week.While shows such as Wanderlust depict polyamory as a tumescent bonk-fest, in reality polyamorous people spend most of their time doing the deeply unsexy business of talking about their feelings. Sanson credits polyamory with giving her more emotional self-awareness. “Polyamory has allowed me to be more introspective, think about the motives behind what I’m doing, identify emotions more accurately and be explicit about how I’m feeling about things.”Polyamory tends to unnerve people, affronting expectations of traditional romantic monogamy. It’s harder for polyamorous people to date: apps such as Tinder or Bumble don’t have options for non-monogamous people, for instance. When James writes in his Tinder bio that he is non-monogamous, he experiences a “significant dip in matches”. And when he tells prospective romantic partners he is polyamorous, it rarely goes down well. “One date told me, ‘I was really interested in you until you told me that.’”Last New Year’s Eve, James went to a party in Sheffield, where he lives. When he walked in, heads swivelled. “They all went: ‘Is that the polyamorous one?’” James is weary of having to defend his way of life, and rightly so: consenting adults shouldn’t have to justify their sex lives to judgmental strangers. “Some people don’t recognise that what’s not right for them isn’t not right for other people,” he says. “I try to point out that it’s not harming anybody if it’s all open and honest.”And monogamous people can learn from polyamory. Twenty-three-year-old Aliyah, who uses theythem pronouns, was polyamorous, but is currently in a monogamous relationship. They credit polyamory with giving them a healthier outlook on monogamy. “The way I was taught monogamy wasn’t healthy,” Aliyah says. “I’d have this constant paranoia of being cheated on.”Polyamory made them better at monogamy. “I learned that monogamy doesn’t have to be as strict as we conceptualise it growing up,” they explain. “Before I felt that deep love should only be reserved for romantic connections. But being polyamorous taught me I have so much love for my friends, and that doesn’t have to be explored in a sexual context.”As polyamory becomes more visible, it won’t be seen as such a tear in our social fabric, but as an ordinary and unremarkable thing. This will be down to the efforts of a new generation who are normalising their freedom to live and love how they want, without nose-wrinkling or head-shaking.“My dad said to me to me the other day, ‘I’m worried about your emotional wellbeing, because you’re building relationships with these people,’” Sanson laughs. “And I was like, ‘I know! That’s the whole point.”Chiara Giovanni, 24, is in a relationship with two people. Her partner Aditya Sharad, 23, is monogamous.Chiara: I always struggled with monogamy and found it quite restrictive. Even though I was super-happy in my relationships, I wasn’t able to be monogamous and faithful. I decided to take a different tack. When I met Aditya I thought, I love this person and want to make them happy, and I need to do this differently. So I was open from the start.Ninety per cent of polyamory is talking. Sometimes I think, I want to watch a movie! I don’t want to talk about our relationship again. But it’s important to be able to express your fears, rather than waiting for the worst thing to happen.I definitely think more people would be polyamorous if they knew what polyamory was, and that it wasn’t just a phase, but valid and long-term and serious. Right now, I’m setting up a time for Aditya to meet my other partner, who is based in the US. They are both super-nervous and really want the other person to like them. It’s really cute.Aditya: At first, when a partner says, “I don’t think conventional relationship settings are working for me,” it’s hard to hear. While Chiari and I decided it would be a polyamorous relationship, I’m not a hugely social person, so it didn’t make a lot of sense for me to have multiple relationships. At the same time, I have a wonderful relationship with Chiara, who I really love. So I thought, let’s give this a try.Jealousy is never the main feeling. Something may trigger the jealousy, but it’s not a primary feeling. You’ll be feeling insecure about something, and that’s what the jealousy is about. You have to communicate about your feelings, and accept you’re not going to be given all the time and attention in your relationship.I do feel fulfilled. I wouldn’t have chosen to be poly myself, but I value Chiara. We have a joyous and uplifting relationship. So it’s not like her being polyamorous is a necessary evil. I’m just invested in what allows us to lead a life together, and what is important to her, and makes her happy.If you’d told me about polyamory eight years ago I’d have been like, “What, really, that works?” But it does. You need to be intentional about it, but it can work.Laura Nevo, 30, is part of a four-person polycule, along with William Jeffrey, Alex Sanson, and Mike Scoins.I started polyamory as an experiment. I had been in monogamous relationships all my life, and when I met my partner Mike he was honest with me. He said: “I like you, but I’m going to carry on dating other people.” I thought, fair enough. I did some research into polyamory and began to date multiple people. In previous monogamous relationships, I’d cheat on my partners and feel guilty about it. I didn’t want that to happen again.I’ve been dating Mike for two years and William for one year. I also hang out a lot with Alex, and there are other people I may have sex with. It gives me a lot of happiness to see my partners together, like William and Mike for example. It’s nice to be able to be happy for someone else, without having to be a part of their happiness.Recently, I had a challenge because one of my partners became involved with someone I really didn’t connect with. I’m trying to work through that and not bottle things up. I used to suffer from anxiety and low self-esteem, but I’ve found that polyamory helps me a lot, as I have to really figure things out.When someone new comes into our polycule, I’m extra careful of things. I think, how can we deal with this new person? How can we make them comfortable? Because it’s not nice to feel left out.Being polyamorous has felt freeing for me. It has allowed me to meet people I wouldn’t have considered as partners before. I’ve been playing more on the gender spectrum. If I were to go back to monogamy one day, I think the experience of being polyamorous would make me more accepting of people and different types of relationships.Andrea, 30, believes in ‘free and independent agency’Coming out as non-monogamous is a very slow process, because it’s so hard to bring yourself to a point where you know that the other person might terminate the relationship. Some choose to cheat, but I wanted to be open to the person I loved.When I came out as non-monogamous to my girlfriend at the time, she basically said: “I didn’t sign up for this. Why can’t I have the person I met back?” That really hurt, because I never wanted to cause her pain. But I can’t help being myself. We tried to make it work, but eventually we parted ways, because she was monogamous and I wasn’t. Everything else in the relationship worked, so that was really painful.It’s important to be open and communicate about anyone new coming into the scene. If I’m at a party and I meet someone I want to bring home, I text Anita, who I have a romantic and sexual relationship with, and let her know. And my secret tool is Google Calendar. If I’m on a date and Anita wants to hang out, she can just check my calendar for the next available slot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcd9fa67f97dfde718ef2922bcb1a48be7a896a9/0_1751_3744_2247/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85bed41d299ee3cceebb11e2def2a2e0","title":"yoga adriene mishler youtube interview","story":"With 4 million subscribers and hundreds of thousands more watching free weekly videos, Yoga with Adriene is a social media sensation. What makes her fans so devoted?There are more than 2,400 people in the main hall of Alexandra Palace in north London, breathing in unison. “Take the deepest breath you’ve taken all day,” says the woman at the front, “and let it out through the mouth.” Lungs empty en masse. It feels like we’re in the belly of a beast.The woman is 33-year-old yogi and actor Adriene Mishler, and this is the largest live yoga class she has ever held – she is more frequently to be found teaching alone in front of her camera at home in Austin, Texas, than IRL. And it is this intimate version of her that 4 million subscribers to her Yoga with Adriene YouTube channel have come to know and share their homes with. Her particularly popular videos – “Yoga Morning Fresh”, for instance, or “7-Minute Bedtime Yoga” – can get upwards of 2 million viewers. Search “yoga” on Google, and Adriene dominates.“You just want to be her friend,” says Magdalena Krohn, a 32-year-old teacher and performance artist who is at the Ally Pally event, queueing for a cashew curry. Karen Bradley, a 56-year-old health visitor, has travelled from Sheffield to see Adriene. Fifty-year-old civil servant Julie Ashen says she is “not that brilliant with people”, but has nevertheless travelled from Swansea to see Adriene in this setting. You must love her, I say. “I do. She’s quite a phenomenon.”When I tell friends I am meeting Adriene, they get a zealous look in their eyes: “I’m not hyperbolising when I say she changed my life,” more than one confesses – and I know they’re not, because she changed mine, too. Maybe it’s simplistic, but there is a lot to be said for being gently cajoled into focusing on the feeling of the soles of your feet on the yoga mat, when anxious thoughts have been jolting like runaway trains through your mind all day.We meet the day before the event, over an on-brand turmeric latte in an east London cafe. In real life, Adriene is as enthusiastic as her on-screen self – peppy yet sage, welcoming and warm. I mention this special alchemy that has fans talking about her as if she’s a friend. “Yeah, and we are,” she says immediately, as though she feels it too. “Whenever I meet people, I’m always like: ‘Holy shit, it’s such an honour – I get to be in people’s homes, their most vulnerable place.’” Her chat is peppered with talk of blessings and angels, but I would challenge even the most cynical-hearted not to want to get a second round of lattes in.She has a snort-out-loud sense of humour, with a confidence she attributes to a childhood raised by “creative hippies”.“Find what feels good” has been her motto ever since she started in 2012 – her followers recite it with almost evangelical fervour. This approach is part of what has drawn the numbers to her videos, and crowds to north London despite the £40 ticket price – as well as to the other stops on this European tour, which includes free classes. For Krohn, “Adriene was the first teacher who really got me to understand that yoga was about more than just physical flexibility or that kind of ego-driven thing that goes with modern yoga.” Bradley came to yoga because she has arthritis – Adriene has, she says, helped her find some acceptance: “This is where you are … you can still do things but don’t push it, find what you can do.”Practising at home has obvious advantages – people cite cheapness, struggling to get to a studio because of health issues and fitting quick sessions in around family life. Adriene’s focus is on accessibility yoga for all. You could question the altruism – as with any personality on YouTube, she earns revenue from her well-watched channel (the analytics firm Social Blade puts the brand’s annual earnings at up to £284,000). She has a sponsorship deal with Adidas, and  subscribers willing to pay $9.99 (£7.50) a month to access extra content on her Find What Feels Good site. But with millions of people able to access her yoga for free, I’ll get to critiques of her motivation once I’ve untangled from pigeon pose.Yoga is a booming industry – last year, the market was worth $80bn (£74bn) globally. Once a trailblazer, Adriene is now one of a host of online yoga teachers bringing an ancient practice to a mass, modern audience. “There are a lot of people who think it’s a little bit questionable,” she concedes. “I get why people from India are going: ‘Hey, what the hell are you doing?’” Cultural appropriation is a criticism she has seen levelled at a lot of American teachers and one that she thinks, to an extent, is fair. Has she ever been criticised herself? “I don’t actually get it that much and the only times I do, I can tell that person’s never done any of my videos. They’re lumping me in because I’m white, wearing Adidas pants.” She has, she says, “tried to teach the real traditional style yoga … I really want to honour the philosophy.”But that doesn’t mean there hasn’t been room for some online savvy. Her business partner, Chris Sharpe, who she met on the set of a horror film and who had previously produced the successful YouTube series Hilah Cooking, was aware of the need to push the videos up the search engine rankings. It made for knotty decisions. “I did not want to call anything ‘yoga for weight loss’ in the beginning,” she says. But they struck a deal and tried it: “It did so disgustingly well.”They started to play around and chose words they knew would rank highly. She cites a video called Six Pack Abs. “Is that what we abide by and are six-pack abs really possible for women? Nooooo. Anatomically, it’s just ridiculous. But I’m kind of making fun of it.” In the video, she begins in the persona of a dumbbell-bunny, before quickly caving: “Just kidding, if you know me at all I don’t really subscribe to that obsession.” If you’re not familiar with her shtick, you could be forgiven for thinking it a cynical move to get the ratings up. But she is no stranger to body-image issues herself, mentioning that before auditions, she has felt a pressure to diet.Even now, she says being “on YouTube, in tight clothing” means she has had to work hard to avoid feeling the same pressures. Instead, she says she wants to “get people closer to experiencing pure love and acceptance for themselves. She sees these video titles, antithetical to her message, as Trojan horses, bringing people to her channel so she can deliver her alternative: “You can look good all you want, but if you’re still looking in the mirror and not loving who you see, we have it backwards.” It might sound schmaltzy written down, but it is clearly a much-needed message.So why yoga, and why now? It is irresistible to link turbulent times with a practice that can help you feel grounded. I try to make it that neat: has she seen an uptick in numbers on her channels since Trump took office, say? “I don’t know how the numbers have changed in terms of big shifts in politics,” she says, “but I do know that as a woman and as a human living in this time, I feel it.” And she clearly wants her yoga to cut through. She weighs up the next words, almost egging herself on: “I want all the people who voted for Trump to do my yoga. I want all the people who battle with the experience of racism to do yoga.” There’s that yoga for all message again.Her mother is Mexican, and in recent years Adriene has been embracing her heritage more. “Not that I’ve ever tried to hide it – hell no,” she says. “But I wasn’t raised bilingual and I happen to be fair-skinned. Then I had a moment a couple of years ago when I was like: ‘Shoooot, I’m Mexican and nobody knows it.’” She is learning Spanish: “My goal is to be able to do a playlist on my channel that’s all yoga español.”Her brand’s meteoric rise has undoubtedly been helped by the boom in the global wellness industry – estimated in 2015 to be worth nearly $4tn – and Adriene knows it. “I’d be lying if I didn’t say Chris anticipated this … he had the idea of creating something in the world of wellness for a reason.”As for the recent politicisation of the wellness industry, especially in reaction to the more elitist side of it, “I just think that it’s like everything – it’s really not about what you’re putting out there, it’s about how you’re doing it. We’re saying we want everyone to feel good, and yet we’re insinuating the only way to do that is if you have enough money to buy this $65 detox tea, and then it comes in the mail and you’re like: ‘What the fuck, I could make this.’” It’s not something she’s immune to, either: “Hell yeah, I’ve Gooped.”Which is why, she says, she has started to care about the numbers – “It gives me more power to be, like, the people’s yogi.”Back in the hall of Ally Pally, we’re finishing the evening’s practice by hugging ourselves – yes, you read right. Adriene cracks a joke and then we’re all breathing in unison again, like one big, collective lung."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a97c80e2fed1c22cd4190a9a16a4bb3afc8ea43/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b5c54f7bb511c3245a4e57ba4f4b34a","title":"uk newspaper industry demands levy on tech firms","story":"News Media Association says Google and Facebook should fund the journalism from which they profitThe British newspaper industry’s trade body has said the government should force social media sites such as Facebook and Google to pay an annual financial levy to fund journalism, and set up a regulator that would force them to take legal responsibility for all the content on their platforms.The News Media Association, the umbrella group that represents almost all national and local newspapers, including the , also said Facebook should share revenue with newspaper groups when their stories appear in newsfeeds – even if users only see the headlines and do not click.It also called on the government to introduce a tax credit system, similar to that used to encourage investment in the British film industry, which would allow newspapers to claim a cash rebate for investment in areas such as investigative journalism.Other ideas include forcing social media businesses to promote “bona fide” news sources that meet certain quality criteria, such as “consistent quality” of journalism – potentially prioritising material from more established news sources at the expense of new entrants.The organisation made the proposals in its response to a government-backed review of the future of the British media industry, chaired by the economist Dame Frances Cairncross, which is attempting to find a future for sustainable high-quality journalism in the UK.“The primary focus of concern today is the loss of advertising revenues which have previously sustained quality national and local journalism, and are now flowing to the global search engines and social media companies who make no meaningful contribution to the cost of producing the original content from which they so richly benefit,” said a spokesperson for the NMA.The suggestions from the British newspaper industry, which has seen its revenue halve from £6.8bn in 2007 to £3.6bn in 2017, come as the government considers proposals for a standalone internet regulator following a series of social media scandals. A new regulator could be unveiled by the end of the year.Traditional news outlets have a difficult relationship with Facebook and Google, which they blame for sucking away valuable ad revenue. While they are desperately seeking to rein in the power of the two companies, they also find themselves increasingly reliant on them to drive readers to their websites. When Spain attempted to force Google to pay publishers in 2014, the tech firm responded by simply shutting down Google News in the country.With that in mind, the NMA also called for tech companies “to give reasonable notice of any changes to terms of business or to algorithms which impact news publishers”. Tweaks to Facebook’s secretive algorithm, which decide which content is seen by users, can upend the news business by dramatically increasing or decreasing the traffic sent to a website depending on the type of content produced.The NMA also said problems facing the newspaper industry are fundamentally about a collapse in revenue rather than a collapse in the appetite for their material, saying that the popularity of the free BBC News website meant most Britons expect to get their online news for free.Radical ideas for reform of the British news industry are becoming more widespread as its financial decline becomes more apparent. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has already pledged a levy on tech firms to fund the BBC.Facebook has insisted it is working to prioritise more trusted news sources following criticism of its role in the spread of false information, although popular viral publishers still dominate its most-shared list. Google has often pointed to its investment in the Google News Initiative, which hands out millions of pounds to publishers, although critics have suggested the funds are not enough to make up for lost ad revenue.Impress, the official recognised press regulator, which does not regulate any major publications, also submitted its findings to the review and backed tax benefits for publishers and an equivalent to charitable status for publishers of high-quality journalism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ec7f301b4ec5f51242269f1830fcf61d302d73d/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66c1e276f1b21a55b415c881d2320b5c","title":"calvin harris v diplo which is the best superstar dj","story":"They’ve both got fake names, famous friends, Dua Lipa collabs and chart-conquering hits. So how to separate them? Why, by pitting them against each other in a (metaphorical) battle to the deathBut in this world, nothing can be said to be certain,” Benjamin Franklin once said in 1789, “except death and taxes, and the fact that at any one time, somewhere on the planet, an extremely normal-looking man will be earning $75m to be a DJ.” And of those normal-looking men, the two biggest? If you ignore the existence of Steve Aoki, Tiësto, both the lads out of Daft Punk and almost certainly some Dutch 22-year-old whose entire career has boomed and busted in the time since I started this sentence, the two biggest are: Calvin Harris (Scotland) and Diplo (United States).When we love some things, we must pit them against each other. We all agree we all love massive sound-of-the-summer EDM-inspired mega-bangers (Harris recently dropped Promises with Sam Smith Diplo just did Electricity with Mark Ronson and Dua Lipa both of these songs are Very Good) ... but who is the best producer of them? Via a series of solidly scientific metrics, we can now find out ...Bizarrely, Calvin Harris isn’t just called “Calvin Harris”: he has an underlying normal name, a normal name beneath his normal name, and that is “Adam Wiles” (his ex-girlfriend Taylor Swift famously sent the internet spinning while expressing gratitude to her then-boyfriend, “Adam”, when accepting a statue at the 2016 iHeartRadio awards. Nobody knew Calvin Harris wasn’t called “Calvin Harris”). Diplo, less bizarrely, was not assigned the name “Diplo” at birth: he was born Thomas Wesley Pentz Jr, and had Diploness thrust upon him. I think it’s pretty easy to see who has won this one, isn’t it? Diplo had such a cool name that he had to call himself “Diplo” to one-up it. Calvin Harris only had to change his name to “Calvin Harris” to make it more interesting.Diplo 1, Calvin 0Strong round for Calvin Harris, who used to look like every single one of the Inbetweeners ran into each other at speed and morphed into the same tall Scottish bloke, whereas Diplo has pretty much always looked like a yoga-and-juice-cleanse tech CEO who goes viral for doing a slightly-too-enthusiastic TED talk about “disruption”.Calvin 1, Diplo 0Diplo has branched out repeatedly – his Silk City and Major Lazer side-hustles, as well as the Jack ÜSkrillex project, has resulted in some of his biggest singles – whereas one of Harris’s most notable projects was a short-lived YouTube channel (JAM.TV) where he got his guest vocalists on camera to unscrew jars of jam and marmalade. So. Pretty easy win for Diplo, here. Diplo 1, Calvin 0Calvin Harris is six-five, which is frankly monstrous. Diplo, at a far more normal five-10, loses this round. Sadly, this leaves us at a complete impasse.Calvin 1, Diplo 0This is a very close one: both have worked with some of the biggest artists in the world (Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, Katy Perry, MIA, Pharrell) as well as smaller artists whose status grew after guesting on their singles, but very crucially Calvin Harris has done two songs with Rihanna and, when Diplo tried to play her a song once, she said it sounded like “a reggae song at an airport”, one of the century’s greatest disses. Calvin 1, Diplo 0On Instagram, Calvin Harris comments an extremely normal amount. That is OK. Diplo does not do this. Diplo simply comments an unnatural amount on Instagram. I am talking liking … every post. If you go on the latest photo of any famous person, Diplo will be there at the bottom, dropping a couple of lightning emojis or saying something sassy about the picture itself. My theory is that Diplo doesn’t actually do all this himself – he has a huge, swarming, thousands-strong army of commenters with his login details, who work interlocking eight-hour shifts to cover every single post – but he is still possibly the world’s most prolific Instagram commenter, and if you don’t watch out Diplo will be on your Instagram too, saying “Wow” followed by the horny purple devil emoji on a photo of a stew you made.

A schedule released in advance by Downing Street shows that among those she will meet later that day is Hassan Rouhani.No 10 said the prime minister would raise the case of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman who has spent more than two years in jail in Iran accused of spying. May “will express serious concern at Nazanin’s ongoing detention and call for her to be released on humanitarian grounds”, a senior British government official said.May is also to hold talks with Donald Trump on Wednesday morning, before she makes her main speech to the assembly at the United Nations headquarters in New York, details of which have not been announced.She will also see the US president on Tuesday when he chairs a session of the UN security council on weapons proliferation. There, she is to warn about the use of chemical weapons, noting both attacks in Syria and the attack in Salisbury which the UK says was carried out by Russia.The focus on international diplomacy could be seen as a brief Brexit respite for May, between the humiliation of the rebuff from EU leaders in Salzburg over her Chequers plan, and what is likely to be a tempestuous Conservative party conference next week.May chaired a meeting of her cabinet a day earlier than usual on Monday, with the fate of the Chequers proposals expected to have been closely discussed.The subject will not, however, be absent in New York. The prime minister will update Trump on Brexit talks during their meeting, and again petition the sometimes capricious president over a swift trade deal between the UK and US.On Wednesday morning, she will expect to face questions on Brexit at a business forum organised by the Bloomberg news organisation, where she will meet its founder, the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, and top executives from Google and drinks behemoth InBev, among others.At the security council meeting, May will warn that the chemical weapons attacks in Ghouta, Syria, and the use of the novichok nerve agent in Salisbury show “the red lines around the use of chemical weapons are being eroded”.In comments released by Downing Street before the trip, May said: “Attacks such as Salisbury and Ghouta are despicable in their own right, but they are also a threat to the wider international system.“Each time we fail to challenge the use or development of weapons of mass destruction, it erodes the framework of treaties we have built up so painstakingly over the past few decades.”While praising the international response against Russia over the Salisbury attack, May said the international community needed to do more, “both to prevent future chemical weapons use and to ensure those who use them are held to account, but also to tackle the range of other threats to global security, including the proliferation of WMD”.In other engagements at the UN, May will host an event on girls’ education worldwide alongside France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau.She will also and speak alongside President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana and President Paul Kagame of Rwanda, as well as the Microsoft founder turned philanthropist Bill Gates, about employment in Africa.She is scheduled to have more bilateral meetings with other leaders, details of which have yet to be confirmed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c49b1f4791a7522aa4fecd20ce3c29fb098c3a94/0_1181_5901_3542/master/5901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b88ebb8e406fe894c1fad631f1c96954","title":"about time why western philosophy can only teach us so much","story":"By gaining greater knowledge of how others think, we can become less certain of the knowledge we think we have, which is always the first step to greater understanding.

The origins of Indian, Chinese and ancient Greek philosophy, as well as Buddhism, can all be traced back to a period of roughly 300 years, beginning in the 8th century BC.These early philosophies have shaped the different ways people worship, live and think about the big questions that concern us all. Most people do not consciously articulate the philosophical assumptions they have absorbed and are often not even aware that they have any, but assumptions about the nature of self, ethics, sources of knowledge and the goals of life are deeply embedded in our cultures and frame our thinking without our being aware of them.Yet, for all the varied and rich philosophical traditions across the world, the western philosophy I have studied for more than 30 years – based entirely on canonical western texts – is presented as the universal philosophy, the ultimate inquiry into human understanding. Comparative philosophy – study in two or more philosophical traditions – is left almost entirely to people working in anthropology or cultural studies. This abdication of interest assumes that comparative philosophy might help us to understand the intellectual cultures of India, China or the Muslim world, but not the human condition.This has become something of an embarrassment for me. Until a few years ago, I knew virtually nothing about anything other than western philosophy, a tradition that stretches from the ancient Greeks to the great universities of Europe and the US. Yet, if you look at my PhD certificate or the names of the university departments where I studied, there is only one, unqualified, word: philosophy. Recently and belatedly, I have been exploring the great classical philosophies of the rest of the world, travelling across continents to encounter them first-hand. It has been the most rewarding intellectual journey of my life.My philosophical journey has convinced me that we cannot understand ourselves if we do not understand others. Getting to know others requires avoiding the twin dangers of overestimating either how much we have in common or how much ides us. Our shared humanity and the perennial problems of life mean that we can always learn from and identify with the thoughts and practices of others, no matter how alien they might at first appear. At the same time, differences in ways of thinking can be both deep and subtle. If we assume too readily that we can see things from others’ points of view, we end up seeing them from merely a variation of our own.To travel around the world’s philosophies is an opportunity to challenge the beliefs and ways of thinking we take for granted. By gaining greater knowledge of how others think, we can become less certain of the knowledge we think we have, which is always the first step to greater understanding.Take the example of time. Around the world today, time is linear, ordered into past, present and future. Our days are organised by the progression of the clock, in the short to medium term by calendars and diaries, history by timelines stretching back over millennia. All cultures have a sense of past, present and future, but for much of human history this has been underpinned by a more fundamental sense of time as cyclical. The past is also the future, the future is also the past, the beginning also the end.The dominance of linear time fits in with an eschatological worldview in which all of human history is building up to a final judgment. This is perhaps why, over time, it became the common-sense way of viewing time in the largely Christian west. When God created the world, he began a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. As Revelation puts it, while prophesying the end times, Jesus is this epic’s “Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last”.But there are other ways of thinking about time. Many schools of thought believe that the beginning and the end are and have always been the same because time is essentially cyclical. This is the most intuitively plausible way of thinking about eternity. When we imagine time as a line, we end up baffled: what happened before time began? How can a line go on without end? A circle allows us to visualise going backwards or forwards for ever, at no point coming up against an ultimate beginning or end.Thinking of time cyclically especially made sense in premodern societies, where there were few innovations across generations and people lived very similar lives to those of their grandparents, their great-grandparents and going back many generations. Without change, progress was unimaginable. Meaning could therefore only be found in embracing the cycle of life and death and playing your part in it as best you could.East Asian philosophy is deeply rooted in the cycle of the seasons, part of a larger cycle of existence. This is particularly evident in Taoism, and is vividly illustrated by the surprising cheerfulness of the 4th century BC Taoist philosopher Zhuangzi when everyone thought he should have been mourning for his wife. At first, he explained, he was as miserable as anyone else. Then he thought back beyond her to the beginning of time itself: “In all the mixed-up bustle and confusion, something changed and there was qi. The qi changed and there was form. The form changed and she had life. Today there was another change and she died. It’s just like the round of four seasons: spring, summer, autumn and winter.”In Chinese thought, wisdom and truth are timeless, and we do not need to go forward to learn, only to hold on to what we already have. As the 19th- century Scottish sinologist James Legge put it, Confucius did not think his purpose was “to announce any new truths, or to initiate any new economy. It was to prevent what had previously been known from being lost.” Mencius, similarly, criticised the princes of his day because “they do not put into practice the ways of the ancient kings”. Mencius also says, in the penultimate chapter of the eponymous collection of his conversations, close to the book’s conclusion: “The superior man seeks simply to bring back the unchanging standard, and, that being correct, the masses are roused to virtue.” The very last chapter charts the ages between the great kings and sages.A hybrid of cyclical and linear time operates in strands of Islamic thought. “The Islamic conception of time is based essentially on the cyclic rejuvenation of human history through the appearance of various prophets,” says Seyyed Hossein Nasr, professor emeritus of Islamic studies at George Washington University. Each cycle, however, also moves humanity forward, with each revelation building on the former – the dictation of the Qur’an to Muhammad being the last, complete testimony of God – until ultimately the series of cycles ends with the appearance of the Mahdi, who rules for 40 years before the final judgment.The distinction between linear and cyclical time is therefore not always neat. The assumption of an eitheror leads many to assume that oral philosophical traditions have straightforwardly cyclical conceptions of time. The reality is more complicated. Take Indigenous Australian philosophies. There is no single Australian first people with a shared culture, but there are enough similarities across the country for some tentative generalisations to be made about ideas that are common or dominant. The late anthropologist David Maybury-Lewis suggested that time in Indigenous Australian culture is neither cyclical nor linear instead, it resembles the space-time of modern physics. Time is intimately linked to place in what he calls the “dreamtime” of “past, present, future all present in this place”.“One lives in a place more than in a time,” is how Stephen Muecke puts it in his book Ancient and Modern: Time, Culture and Indigenous Philosophy. More important than the distinction between linear or cyclical time is whether time is separated from or intimately connected to place. Take, for example, how we conceive of death. In the contemporary west, death is primarily seen as the expiration of the inidual, with the body as the locus, and the location of that body irrelevant. In contrast, Muecke says: “Many indigenous accounts of the death of an inidual are not so much about bodily death as about a return of energy to the place of emanation with which it re-identifies.”Such a way of thinking is especially alien to the modern west, where a pursuit of objectivity systematically downplays the particular, the specifically located. In a provocative and evocative sentence, Muecke says: “Let me suggest that longsightedness is a European form of philosophical myopia and that other versions of philosophy, indigenous perhaps, have a more lived-in and intimate association with societies of people and the way they talk about themselves.”Muecke cites the Australian academic Tony Swain’s view that the concept of linear time is a kind of fall from place. “I’ve got a hunch that modern physics separated out those dimensions and worked on them, and so we produced time as we know it through a whole lot of experimental and theoretical activities,” Muecke told me. “If you’re not conceptually and experimentally separating those dimensions, then they would tend to flow together.” His indigenous friends talk less of time or place independently, but more of located events. The key temporal question is not “When did this happen?” but “How is this related to other events?”That word related is important. Time and space have become theoretical abstractions in modern physics, but in human culture they are concrete realities. Nothing exists purely as a point on a map or a moment in time: everything stands in relation to everything else. So to understand time and space in oral philosophical traditions, we have to see them less as abstract concepts in metaphysical theories and more as living conceptions, part and parcel of a broader way of understanding the world, one that is rooted in relatedness. Hirini Kaa, a lecturer at the University of Auckland, says that “the key underpinning of Maori thought is kinship, the connectedness between humanity, between one another, between the natural environment”. He sees this as a form of spirituality. “The ocean wasn’t just water, it wasn’t something for us to be afraid of or to utilise as a commodity, but became an ancestor deity, Tangaroa. Every living thing has a life force.”This should be clear enough. But the tradition of western philosophy, in particular, has striven for a universality that glosses over differences of time and place. The word “university”, for example, even shares the same etymological root as “universal”. In such institutions, “the pursuit of truth recognises no national boundaries”, as one commentator observed. Place is so unimportant in western philosophy that, when I discovered it was the theme of the quinquennial East-West Philosophers’ Conference in 2016, I wondered if there was anything I could bring to the party at all. (I decided that the absence of place in western philosophy itself merited consideration.)The universalist thrust has many merits. The refusal to accept any and every practice as a legitimate custom has bred a very good form of intolerance for the barbaric and unjust traditional practices of the west itself. Without this intolerance, we would still have slavery, torture, fewer rights for women and homosexuals, feudal lords and unelected parliaments. The universalist aspiration has, at its best, helped the west to transcend its own prejudices. At the same time, it has also legitimised some prejudices by confusing them with universal truths. The philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah argues that the complaints of anti-universalists are not generally about universalism at all, but pseudo-universalism, “Eurocentric hegemony posing as universalism”. When this happens, intolerance for the indefensible becomes intolerance for anything that is different. The aspiration for the universal becomes a crude insistence on the uniform. Sensitivity is lost to the very different needs of different cultures at different times and places.This “posing as universalism” is widespread and often implicit, with western concepts being taken as universal but Indian ones remaining Indian, Chinese remaining Chinese, and so on. To end this pretence, Jay L Garfield and Bryan W Van Norden propose that those departments of philosophy that refuse to teach anything from non-western traditions at least have the decency to call themselves departments of western philosophy.The “pattern thinking” of Maori and Indigenous Australian philosophies could provide a corrective to the assumption that our values are the universal ones and that others are aberrations. It makes credible and comprehensible the idea that philosophy is never placeless and that thinking that is uprooted from any land soon withers and dies.Mistrust of the universalist aspiration, however, can go too far. At the very least, there is a contradiction in saying there are no universal truths, since that is itself a universal claim about the nature of truth. The right view probably lies somewhere between the claims of naive universalists and those of defiant localists. There seems to be a sense in which even the universalist aspiration has to be rooted in something more particular. TS Eliot is supposed to have said: “Although it is only too easy for a writer to be local without being universal, I doubt whether a poet or novelist can be universal without being local, too.” To be purely universal is to inhabit an abstract universe too detached from the real world. But just as a novelist can touch on universals of the human condition through the particulars of a couple of characters and a specific story, so our different, regional philosophical traditions can shed light on more universal philosophical truths even though they approach them from their own specific angles.We should not be afraid to ground ourselves in our own traditions, but we should not be bound by them. Gandhi put this poetically when he wrote: “I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the cultures of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any. I refuse to live in other people’s houses as an interloper, a beggar or a slave.”In the west, the predominance of linear time is associated with the idea of progress that reached its apotheosis in the Enlightenment. Before this, argues the philosopher Anthony Kenny, “people looking for ideals had looked backwards in time, whether to the primitive church, or to classical antiquity, or to some mythical prelapsarian era. It was a key doctrine of the Enlightenment that the human race, so far from falling from some earlier eminence, was moving forward to a happier future.”Kenny is expressing a popular view, but many see the roots of belief in progress deeper in the Christian eschatological religious worldview. “Belief in progress is a relic of the Christian view of history as a universal narrative,” claims John Gray. Secular thinkers, he says, “reject the idea of providence, but they continue to think humankind is moving towards a universal goal”, even though “the idea of progress in history is a myth created by the need for meaning”.Whether faith in progress is an invention or an adaptation of the Enlightenment, the image of secular humanists naively believing humanity is on an irreversible, linear path of advancement seems to me a caricature of their more modest hope, based in history, that progress has occurred and that more is possible. As the historian Jonathan Israel says, Enlightenment ideas of progress “were usually tempered by a strong streak of pessimism, a sense of the dangers and challenges to which the human condition is subject”. He dismisses the idea that “Enlightenment thinkers nurtured a naive belief in man’s perfectibility” as a “complete myth conjured up by early 20th-century scholars unsympathetic to its claims”.Nevertheless, Gray is right to point out that linear progress is a kind of default way of thinking about history in the modern west and that this risks blinding us to the ways in which gains can be lost, advances reversed. It also fosters a sense of the superiority of the present age over earlier, supposedly less “advanced” times. Finally, it occludes the extent to which history doesn’t repeat itself but does rhyme.The different ways in which philosophical traditions have conceived time turn out to be far from mere metaphysical curiosities. They shape the way we think about both our temporal place in history and our relation to the physical places in which we live. It provides one of the easiest and clearest examples of how borrowing another way of thinking can bring a fresh perspective to our world. Sometimes, simply by changing the frame, the whole picture can look very different.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.This is an edited extract from How the World Thinks: A Global History of Philosophy, published by Granta on 4 October.

A fortnight ago, Jacob Rees-Mogg, David Davis, Steve Baker, Boris Johnson and other leading members of the European Research Group squeezed themselves into a Westminster committee room to share their excitement at having found a single economist who was optimistic about Brexit. Here was the way forward. Ignore the doom-mongers, just crash out of the EU on World Trade Organization terms and the UK would be more than £1tn better off. Happy days all round.Until today, when many of the usual suspects – with the exception of Boris, who tweeted his undying solidarity with anything and anyone that helped him become Tory leader – rattled around in a barely half full Gladstone library of the Liberal Club to tell a handful of reporters that – much to their surprise – they had found a second economist who was tremendously enthusiastic about Brexit. Only he had come up with a completely different model – something more akin to a Canada-style trade deal – so that’s what they were now endorsing. Fickle doesn’t begin to describe them. Though simple-minded might.Shanker Singham, the author of the IEA’s “Plan A+”, was introduced as the country’s leading trade lawyer. Which rather suggested there can’t be much competition for that coveted title, as Singham immediately did his best to live down to expectations. The problem with the Brexit negotiations so far, he declared confidently, was that we had been treating them as a problem singular to the UK and the EU. Silly, silly us. His reasoning was all to be found in footnote 28 on page 37 of his report. Which didn’t appear to exist.What we should have been doing is signing loads of other trade deals with the US and the rest of the world behind the EU’s back – the US was apparently just gagging to do deals before it knew what final trade arrangement we had agreed with the EU – because the EU would definitely never have found out was going on and pointed out its illegality, said the country’s leading trade lawyer, failing to grasp the basics of international trade.The four politicians on the panel heroically maintained the idiocy quotient. The former Labour MP Gisela Stuart excelled herself by claiming that Brexit was actually a game of four-dimensional chess and we needed negotiators who could rise above the two-dimensional. Which rather ruled out everyone on the panel as you wouldn’t trust any of them not to lose a game of draughts to a five-year-old.Rees-Mogg loftily declared that he had already solved the problem of the Irish border in a previous presentation, that had been dismissed out of hand as fantasy by everyone who understands the issues, and so there was no reason why Theresa May shouldn’t immediately accept these new proposals as government policy. Other than the fact that even she recognised them to be unworkable. Which is saying something.The last word went to David Davis, who can seldom resist the opportunity of saying something he will later regret. Most deals were really only finalised in the last 48 seconds, he insisted. Which explained both why he had invariably come off worse in all negotiations and why he had done almost nothing during his time as Brexit secretary. The possibility now has to be entertained that Davis has been an undercover agent for staying in the EU all along. It’s the only rational explanation.If there is a third economist who thinks Brexit is going to benefit the UK, she wasn’t to be found in Liverpool, where the Labour party was going through massive contortions at its conference to find a way of keeping everyone happy. And pleasing no one. While everyone seemingly agreed Brexit was a terrible idea, the party leadership seemed to think the solution lay in only offering people a vote on a bad deal or an even worse deal. Clowns to the left, jokers to the right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a758611f9febefe6ae153bf7e2c73e54e99a6a59/231_364_3162_1898/master/3162.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c28d871b9df0849772aac0f7d83e3a52","title":"labour conference brexit debate starmer increasingly likely to vote down mays brexit deal starmer says politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the Labour conference in Liverpool, including the debate on Brexit and a second referendumJane Begley, a councillor and a delegate from Exeter, is seconding the Brexit composite now.She says it is important not to alienate those who voted leave. This motion does not bind the leadership but empowers them to act through the unpredictable times ahead, she says.Tim Roache, the GMB general secretary, is speaking now.He is moving the composite motion. The GMB came out in favour of a vote on the final deal at their conference recently.He pays tribute to Keir Starmer, and says the negotiations would be going better if he were in charge.He says, if Theresa May is so confident of her deal, she should put it to the people. That is what trade unionists do, he says. He says they get a deal and then put it to their members.Starmer says, if May comes back with no deal, Labour must shape what happens next.Its preference is for a general election, he says.But, if that does not happen, there must be other options, he says. And that must include campaigning for a public debate.It is right that parliament has the first say, he says. But if there is an impasse, campaigning for a public vote must be an option. He goes on:And nobody is ruling out remain as an option.Delegates are cheering and applauding wildly. Some of them stand up. The applause goes on far longer than is normal for a political speech.Starmer is now on the passage briefed overnight saying Labour will vote down a deal that does not meet Labour’s test, or a “blind” detail without details. See 8.05am for the full quote.Starmer says the Tories are offering “ision, chaos and failure” on Brexit.Just when we need a strong government, what do we see from the Tories? Division, chaos and failure.No credible plan for Brexit. No solution to prevent a hard border in Ireland. And no majority in parliament for the Chequers proposals.A Tory civil war that has gone on for years, now threatens our future prosperity. The party that once promised that it would fix the roof while the sun was shining is now intent on burning the whole house down.So, I’ve got a message for the prime minister. ‘If your party wants to tear itself apart, that’s fine, but you’re not taking our country with you.’Starmer says it is ridiculous for Theresa May to say people should trust her on Brexit.She created the hostile environment for immigrants, he says.And he says she appointed a Northern Ireland secretary who doesn’t know the basics.Starmer says he is an internationalist. He believes the challenges facing the world are based addressed with our EU partners.Labour did not duck the challenge of Brexit, he says. It would have been easy to wish away the result. But it did not.Labour was right to say that jobs and the economy must come first, he says.Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is now opening the Labour debate on Brexit.The decision to shelve the plan to create a second deputy leader post for a woman gives a delicious insight into the internal politics of Labour.The idea has been around in the party for some years and, after the current deputy leader, Tom Watson, sided with the MPs who wanted to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn in 2016, some Corbynites began to see the scheme as one that could be used to weaken Watson’s position.Then Watson came out in favour of the idea. And the national executive committee endorsed it. But in recent days there has been speculation that pro-Europeans in the party could use the election to put up a candidate who would stand on a strong “people’s vote” platform. Given how much support there is for a second referendum amongst the membership, such a candidate could win hansomely - in a result that would be awkward for Corbyn, who is distinctly lukewarm about the whole second referendum idea.And so the Corbynite left changed their stance. This was signalled this morning in the daily briefing handed out to delegates by the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy, which is run by the Corbyn ally Peter Willsman. It says:Having at least one woman of the two members of the leadership team, as proposed by Hornsey and Wood Green, should certainly be supported (although their wording is problematic) but this ill-thought through tokenism is not the way forward ...We have the leader we need in Jeremy Corbyn. The last thing we need is another isive leadership contest when we should be focusing on democracy recommendations already in place.UPDATE: Here is some reaction.Labour has shelved plans to create a second deputy leader post, HuffPost’s Paul Waugh reports.This is from Luke Akehurst, a centrist in the party and a former member of Labour’s national executive committee.And the Conservatives are also criticising Labour for contemplating a second referendum. Brandon Lewis, the Tory chairman, has put out this statement in response to Sir Keir Starmer’s interviews this morning. (See 9.35am.) Lewis said:Keir Starmer has confirmed Labour would break their promises and take us back to square one on Brexit.In the space of one morning, he has refused to rule out delaying Brexit, refused to confirm Labour would end freedom of movement, and opened the door to staying in the EU with a second referendum. Labour’s promises on Brexit aren’t worth the paper they’re written on.Labour Leave (which is as it says on the tin) is claiming that backing a second referendum on Brexit could cost the party 19 seats, the BBC’s Norman Smith reports.At the conference delegates are now debating 14 proposed changes to party rules. One of them would create a second deputy leader post, to be filled by a woman. Many of the 14 ideas are opposed by the leadership, including one that would water down the current rule saying people who support other parties should be banned from joining Labour. Ella Kearney, a delegate in favour of the change, said the current rule was too restrictive because it excluded hard-working socialists who support Labour’s aims and principles. The votes on the changes will take place at the end of the day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8df48f88686b1d7e3554f52654eb9b563c06fbc/0_147_4592_2756/master/4592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba5f5e482a22be6f4d5354ae2860cd90","title":"10 minutes of exercise a day improves memory","story":"Researchers have shown that the brain’s ability to store memories improves after a short burst of exercise Just 10 minutes of light physical activity is enough to boost brain connectivity and help the brain to distinguish between similar memories, a new study suggests.Scientists at the University of California studying brain activity found connectivity between parts of the brain responsible for memory formation and storage increased after a brief interval of light exercise – such as 10 minutes of slow walking, yoga or tai chi. The findings could provide a simple and effective means of slowing down or staving off memory loss and cognitive decline in people who are elderly or have low levels of physical ability. The same experiment was repeated on 16 of the volunteers who had either undertaken the same kind of exercise or rested, with researchers scanning their brain to monitor activity. In the brains of those who had exercised they discovered enhanced communication between the hippocampus – a region important in memory storage – and the cortical brain regions, which are involved in vivid recollection of memories.“The memory task really was quite challenging,” said Michael Yassa, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Irvine, and project co-leader. The participants were first shown pictures of objects from everyday life – ranging from broccoli to picnic baskets – and later tested on how well they remembered the images. “We used very tricky similar items to to see if they would remember whether it was this exact picnic basket versus that picnic basket,” he said.The people who had exercised were better at separating or distinguishing between the different memories, say the scientists writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.“An evening stroll is sufficient to get some benefit,” said Yassa, adding that the frequency and exact amount of exercise will depend on the person’s age, level of mobility, potential disability and other lifestyle factors.The scientists also kept track of the participants’ mood changes. “With exercise you do get an enhanced mood. The question is whether that was explaining the effect we got on the behaviour or the effect we got on the brain and it wasn’t,” said Yassa.The authors of the paper are currently using the same method to look at the effects of light exercise on older people over extended periods of time.“Our main goal is to try to develop an exercise prescription that can be used by older adults who might have disabilities or mobility impairments, but can still adopt a very simple exercise regimen and be able to, perhaps, stave off cognitive decline,” said Yassa.Encouraged by the results, Yassa and his team have changed their habits in the lab. “I try to do walking meetings every now and then, and we try to get up every couple of hours and go for a nice 10-minute walk. Based on my experience, not only is the group more productive, but we’re happier,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a56b1d681b5ea46d73c6f56ede52b6479534bf8f/20_36_2528_1517/master/2528.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a45f9c7368ac0c411d5c1e717f8233cd","title":"tony jacklin ryder cup 2018 player guide tiger woods usa europe golf","story":"Europe’s most successful Ryder Cup captain runs the rule over the 24 players who will battle it out in France later this weekHe is an extremely steady all-round performer, but just has difficulty finishing off tournaments in strokeplay. He’s proved his ability in matchplay over the years and the European team is certainly better with him in it.Player rating: 7 out of 10Tommy is a rookie but he could prove to be the next European cab off the Ryder Cup rank. He’s a tremendous ball-striker and hits a lot of fairways and greens. Has zoomed up the world rankings in the last couple of seasons and I don’t think we’ve yet seen the best of him.I don’t think there’s been a better ball-striker anywhere in the last 20 years than Sergio. The difficulty he’s had is showing it. He is probably an underachiever and on current form he is fortunate to have got a wildcard pick.I don’t know how he will fare in matchplay but he has produced some very good scores and great finishes in strokeplay events. He’s got a hot temper, I know that, and sometimes that can be a help in matchplay.The game of golf is almost impossible to perfect but Rory has come almost as close to Tiger Woods in terms of attaining perfection. He’s a world-class player and I’d love to see him reproduce the passion he showed at Hazeltine two years ago.Judging by what we saw of Francesco in the summer, when he won three tournaments out of five including the Open at Carnoustie, Thomas Bjørn will be hoping that he proves one of the linchpins of the team.When he’s on top of his game, Alex is a classy performer. I don’t know him personally but I can see he’s a very determined inidual. Has taken his game to new heights since winning four times in 2016.Thorbjorn has qualified for the team by right so his credentials are proven. He is another European player who is a bit of an unknown quantity in matchplay. Will be a help to have his countryman Bjørn on hand in the team room.Ian is the best matchplayer in the whole damn thing. He has a ferocious will to win and who can forget the truly inspirational way he fired Europe to victory when they were staring defeat in the face at Medinah in 2012?Jon’s fiery temper gets the better of him occasionally but he is a fine player and very determined. He started the season well but I’m just a bit worried that he might have gone off the boil in recent months.Justin can get too mechanical from time to time but his new claw-style grip has improved his putting and that’s the most important aspect of the game. A genuine world-class player, as he proved by winning the FedExCup in Atlanta on Sunday, and his partnership with Henrik Stenson could be pivotal.His consistency, tenacity and determination is always spot on. He’s had a few injury problems of late and I just hope he stays fit. He played amazingly well to win the Open at Royal Troon two years ago. A major title was long overdue for Henrik.He goes about things a bit differently to most but it works. You can see from the look on his face that he’s a determined guy, a real warrior, and I think he’ll be a great asset for the Americans. A bit of an unknown quantity in matchplay, though.He may be the fourth and final captain’s pick but Tony Finau is certainly no slouch. He’s the PGA Tour’s ‘Steady Eddie’, their Mr Consistent. He churns out top-10 finish after top-10 finish and reminds me very much of Vijay Singh with that lovely, languid swing tempo of his.Rickie is exceptionally consistent and an excellent putter. It’s simply a question of time before he lands that first major championship victory.Back on top of the world rankings, if Dustin putts well nobody can beat him in strokeplay or matchplay. He’s awesome, longer than anyone else off the tee, and the game seems to come so easily for him.He came up with a throwaway line a few weeks ago that really resonated with me when he said, ‘Nobody’s more confident than me’. That wasn’t a boast, it was just a matter of fact, and you only have to watch him to see he is full of self-belief.When Phil talks, you listen, when Phil plays, you watch. He’s a special talent. I’d put him and Tiger Woods on a level footing. Both have all the experience in the world. Tiger might have the edge but Phil is equally as talented.He revels in the red-hot atmosphere of Ryder Cup combat. It was terrific to be there at Hazeltine to see him and Rory McIlroy going head-to-head with so much passion. He’s fearless and loves to show off his skills. A real showman.He’s got his putting sorted out since the anchor ban. He was struggling with it but has improved since he started holding the putter alongside his forearm. Once he sees the lines on the greens, it almost seems to become automatic for him.A fiery competitor. What he’s achieved in the last five years, at his age, is remarkable. Jordan has no real weaknesses and will bring an enormous amount to the USA team room.Justin’s a great talent. A couple of his close pals, Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler, got out of the blocks a bit quicker at the start of their careers but he’s caught them up now. A world-class player.Like DeChambeau, he goes at things in an unorthodox way, but what a talent. He’s won three times this year and when he gets off and running, he is unstoppable. Hits stray shots now and again, though, and not quite as consistent as others.It’s marvellous to see him back after all his physical problems and great to see him on top form again. That was a remarkable victory in Atlanta on Sunday. One thing’s for sure, he’s got the admiration of every other player in the competition.As told to Tony Jimenez.

As outlined to the  a fortnight ago, World Rugby’s vice-chairman Agustín Pichot believes significant change is required for the global game to flourish financially and his proposed solution will be debated in Sydney this Wednesday. Should he gain sufficient support, it will spell the end of the traditional matrix of June and November tour fixtures.Pichot and his supporters want to see a new “World League” run along similar lines to European football’s new Nations League, rather than the current succession of (so-called) “friendlies”. The top 12 sides in the world rankings would be split into pools potentially hosted in alternate years by the northern and southern hemispheres, with three pool games for each team, followed by semi-finals and a final. Five huge weekends in total, with shared television rights, would lend an extra “edge” (to use Pichot’s word) to some previously mundane fixtures.Would it benefit the game? From a purely rugby perspective the answer is potentially yes. The current June and November Tests tend to involve at least one team staggering towards the end of a long season: by unifying the “windows” into one block, it would help to level the playing field. There would also be a collective narrative for everyone else to follow, replacing the “here today gone tomorrow” disposability of one-off autumn Tests. Rather than undermining the Rugby World Cup, it might just achieve the opposite and whet the public’s appetite to a greater extent. Less is frequently more in top-level sport.In terms of revenue sharing, it might also help the have-nots. Current international attendances in the southern hemisphere are sliding and there will be certain subscription-based television companies interested in the potential of a fresh full-on tournament with worldwide appeal. Good luck, though, with convincing Premiership Rugby or the Rugby Football Union that this constitutes progress. The English clubs have assorted plans of their own, none of which involve obediently picking up crumbs from the major unions’ schedules. The RFU makes so many millions from big Twickenham occasions that reducing the number of said paydays would involve an entire farmyard of self-interested turkeys voting for Christmas.As Pichot stressed this month, however, rugby can no longer afford selfishness and old-school thinking if it wishes to maximise its full potential. The Six Nations and Rugby Championship competitions would remain intact but a new, streamlined proposition would join them. Assuming a satisfactory revenue-sharing model can be agreed, it would generate more cash for World Rugby’s collective coffers and help emerging nations to emerge a bit quicker. Tonga, Fiji, Japan and others would no longer be fobbed off with the occasional Test abroad. They would be an integral part of the show.This, in turn, would galvanise the nations ranked 13th and below presumably there would also be regional shoot-outs with the winners earning sufficient ranking points to break into the top dozen – or qualify for a play-off – the following year. It might also help players welfare-wise: international players would play fewer Tests overall but the commercial spin-offs could be substantial.Assuming room in the calendar is retained for a British and Irish Lions tour every four years, Pichot’s initiative merits serious consideration, notwithstanding the San Francisco compromise agreement to which all the stakeholders signed up last year. The International Rugby Players’ Association chief executive, Omar Hassanein, is among those who believe the players deserve a much better-structured season: “I think Gus’s comments were very relevant. More money shouldn’t mean more games and shorter rest periods. In order to get the optimum out of these players, we feel they need to be playing less anyway.“We want to ensure that pressures are not put on players to prioritise club over country. As more money gets poured into the club game, that sometimes comes with a perceived entitlement to control the player more. Whilst we understand the club is the paymaster, we think everyone needs to row in behind the fact that the international game should always be the pinnacle.”Hassanein, by the sound of it, entirely agrees with Pichot that Test rugby is coming under genuine threat. “We don’t want the sport to go to a place where the club game is so appealing that players gravitate more and more towards it and start finding reasons not to play in big internationals. Players are very proud of their nations but the game has got to tackle this head on. We need to be very careful that the sport doesn’t get steered towards a club-driven game.” Wednesday’s gathering in Sydney feels like an increasingly pivotal moment in the game’s modern history.One glance at the Gallagher Premiership table tells its own stark story. After four rounds only Saracens and Exeter are still unbeaten while the bottom seven clubs – Harlequins, Leicester, Bristol, Worcester, Newcastle, Northampton and Sale – are separated by only five points. As previously observed in these columns, neither Bristol nor Worcester will be going quietly, if at all. Newcastle and Northampton possess too many good players to be cut adrift, which leaves Harlequins, Leicester and the current basement dwellers Sale, all three Premiership champions in the not too distant past. The annual game of relegation musical chairs has never been more cut-throat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29338665d9a9b68b7e312f49aa5ccdf12634b591/286_83_3096_1858/master/3096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96907ff728a3f0176f04478a008c2334","title":"instagram co founders resign to explore creativity again","story":"Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger leave the social media company amid reports of tensions with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg Instagram co-founders, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, have announced their resignation from the company, which is owned by Facebook Inc, saying that they are leaving to “explore our curiosity and creativity again”.Systrom and Krieger did not say why they were leaving their positions as chief executive officer and chief technical officer, but there were reports that their departure might be due to tensions between the men and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.Bloomberg reported that the men were leaving the photo-sharing app because of growing tensions about the direction of the business since Facebook bought Instagram in 2012. In a statement on Monday, Systrom, the CEO of the company, said he and Krieger were looking forward to “taking some time off to explore our curiosity and creativity again”. He said they were grateful for “the last eight years at Instagram and six years with the Facebook team”.The pair will depart the company soon, and notified the leadership team of the photo-sharing app and Facebook on Monday about their decision to leave, according to Instagram. The New York Times first reported the move.Zuckerberg issued a public statement about the departure saying he had “really enjoyed” working with Systrom and Krieger.“Kevin and Mike are extraordinary product leaders and Instagram reflects their combined creative talents,” wrote Zuckerberg. “I’ve learned a lot working with them for the past six years and have really enjoyed it. I wish them all the best and I’m looking forward to seeing what they build next.”Instagram, which Facebook bought in 2012 for $1bn, has more than 1 billion active monthly users and has grown by adding features like messaging and short videos. In 2016, it added the ability to post slideshows that disappear in 24 hours, a copy of Snapchat’s popular “stories” feature.Instagram is its parent company’s fastest-growing slice of revenue, but it touts 4 million fewer monthly advertisers globally. As Instagram has shown more ads, the average price per ad across Facebook’s entire family of apps has declined earlier this year after a year of upswing. A new privacy law in Europe has also affected prices.The departure of Instagram co-founders comes months after the exit of Jan Koum, co-founder of WhatsApp, which was bought by Facebook in 2014."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588b648d1435fdaf2c71f6975136fe20d42df4f9/0_495_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdade6256ae76e6df514c7dcf5ff709e","title":"historical autumn walks uk cumbria norfolk wales cornwall scotland","story":"Fascinating stories lie at the heart of these autumnal walks, as nature writers follow in the footsteps of a Pictish queen, an eccentric poet-priest, Charles Darwin and more Lengthtime 3½ miles, 2-3 hoursStartfinish Honister Slate Mine Refuel Sky Hi Cafe, at the mineStart the walk with a tour of Honister Slate mine (£17.50 adults, £9.50 children). The entrance is marked by a tiny slate bothy, where the self-employed miners used to sleep, and you get to explore the damp low tunnels below.Alfred Wainwright wandered here and mistakenly referred to the mine as a quarry. He commented: “There is no beauty in despoliation and devastation, but there can be dramatic effect and interest, and so it is here.”From the cafe, take the mine road, which runs parallel with the Honister Pass. It’s on the path of an old tramway used for moving slate. Ignore the footpath to Great Gable on the left. The grey track zigzags upwards past a slate memorial marking the reopening of Honister as both a working mine and tourist attraction by the Duke of Edinburgh in 1997. It had closed in 1989.Then it’s views of the ravaged crags across Honister Pass, a Tolkienesque mass of spoil, tracks and mysterious shafts. It’s a shattered landscape, but set into towering crags it has a strangely desolate beauty. There’s more mining detritus on the shoulder of Fleetwith, with the road marked by standing stones of slate. Turn right and head upwards on a grassy path. Close to the false summit is a ruined miners’ building, making you realise just how high up they worked.For the first two decades of the 20th century, a brilliant ornithologist lived in a houseboat called Water Rail on Hickling Broad, the largest of the flooded medieval peat-diggings that make up the Norfolk Broads. It was an unusual vocation for an Edwardian woman but Emma Turner was an extremely independent-minded person.At the time the bittern, a large and furtive brown bird, was believed to be extinct as a breeding species in England. But Turner discovered a bittern’s nest deep in Hickling’s reed beds, and took excellent photographs to prove it. She became the first female honorary member of the British Ornithologists’ Union and a small island on the broad is named in her honour.Turner’s work was instrumental in getting Hickling’s wild riches recognised and later protected. Today it is a Norfolk Wildlife Trust reserve and remains home to the resurgent bittern.Walking south from the visitor centre, take the right-hand path through oak woods to reach a low floodbank above the reedbeds that surround Hickling. Sails of boats appear above the reeds on the horizon, emphasising just how low this landscape is. Follow the bank along the north-eastern side of the broad, past bird hides and the thatched Edwardian hunting lodge once used by wealthy wildfowlers.While the bittern remains elusive, Hickling is a hotspot for the marsh harrier, a raptor rarer than a golden eagle, as well as Chinese water deer, kingfishers and barn owls. Walk along the floodbank around Hundred Acres Marsh and you’ll reach Stubb drainage windmill, one of around 200 old windpumps that once drained these marshes. Follow Stubb Road back to the visitor centre.This broadland landscape is rich in birdlife but you really experience its strange riches on the water: and this walk can be combined with a fascinating one- or two-hour wildlife water trail by electric boat (£7.50£9.50 adults, £4.50£6 children ): book at the Norfolk Wildlife Trust visitor centre or call 01603 270479. Admission to Hickling is £4 for non-Wildlife Trust members.Patrick Barkham,  writer and author of Islander (Granta, £9.99), The Butterfly Isles and BadgerlandsThis is a lovely moorland walk, including multiple standing stones marking what must have been a prehistoric trackway to the summit of Moel Goedog (367 metres). It passes two ring cairns and a late bronze age hill fort at the summit, with breathtaking views.From Harlech, the going is initially steep but eases off. With Edward I’s castle visible on the left, follow the road that winds up, bordered by high stone walls, right past Harlech castle and its visitor centre. Go straight across the crossroads, with its shops, and the moor beckons – after about three quarters of a mile, turn left at another crossroads. The first standing stone, just to the left of the road, is known as Moel Goedog 8. Carry on straight and the next stone is just by the cattle grid, with a further stone a bit further on the right sadly it’s just a broken pointed stump now.The next standing stone is on the left: here, sheep roam freely, and such stones have, in folklore, been mistaken for sheep – and tales tell of sales made to the drunken and gullible. Stay left and follow the path to another pair of stones, in a field of young bullocks. The final standing stone is Moel Goedog 5.Before the summit there are two ring cairns. First is Moel Goedog West, which is surrounded by other stones up to a metre tall. An excavation in 1978 uncovered bronze age cremation urns. From here, the Dwyryd estuary glistens below, across to distant mountains beyond. The second cairn is some 50m east, on the other side of the path. The hill fort is close to Moel Goedog’s summit and though the ditches and bank are worn, enough remains of it to be worth a visit. It’s possible to carry on a further six miles north-east to the renowned and remote “crown of thorns” cairn circle of Bryn Cader Faner, or head back down past the stones for a drink at the Branwen hotel, the rear of which you passed on the way up close to the castle.Andy Burnham, editor of The Old Stones: A Field Guide to the Megalithic Sites of Britain and Ireland (Watkins Media). More information on these sites at megalithicThis circular walk in north Cornwall takes in clifftops and wooded valleys as well as a tiny driftwood hut. Hawker’s Hut, the focus of the walk, sits high on the cliff and is where eccentric opium-smoking poet-priest Robert Stephen Hawker meditated and wrote poetry.From the Bush Inn, follow the road down to Morwenstow church and into the churchyard, past the figurehead of the Caledonia, a brig wrecked in 1843, which marks the burials Hawker officiated at. Morwenstow, set back from a treacherous stretch of coast, was where Hawker became known both as a missionary to a community of wreckers and smugglers, and as a poet with an eclectic dress sense. (He was often seen in a stylish combination of purple coat, white cravat, fisherman’s jumper and beaver hat.)Follow the path through the graveyard to a stone stile, then past the Old Vicarage into the wooded valley below. Turn left before you reach the stream and follow the valley to emerge at the sea, with Lundy Island visible in the distance. Climb steep steps on your left to the cliff top and five minutes further on is Hawker’s Hut, a tiny room the vicar constructed out of timbers from a wrecked ship. It was his place of sanctuary and inspiration, where he wrote – and indulged in the odd toke on an opium pipe.With a figure like Hawker it’s difficult to distinguish the man from the myth but sit in the hut and listen to waves surging against the cliffs and it’s easy to understand why he loved this place. It’s a hard spot to leave but, back on the path, head on towards the GCHQ radar array before turning left, away from the sea, by Higher Sharpnose Point (where The Caledonia ran aground) up the valley to the signed path left across the fields and back to the 13th-century Bush Inn.Wyl Menmuir, author of Man Booker long-listed The Many (Salt, £8.99)Lengthtime 4½ miles, 3 hoursStartfinish GalmisdaleRefuel Galmisdale Bay cafe and pubThe tiny island of Eigg, off the west coast of Scotland, was, according to legend, the dominion a Pictish queen and her tribe of outsize female warriors. This walk takes you to the Loch of the Big Women, where the sisterhood met an untimely end.From the hamlet of Galmisdale follow the left hand fork in the road through mossy woods scented with wild garlic. Head to Galmisdale farmhouse across a meadow and turn left where the footpath reaches the rough hill track. Look out for the red spots that mark the ascent up Sgùrr, a rock formed from volcanic lava, which sits atop the island like a slightly squashed Hovis loaf.The climb up the hill is steady rather than gruelling. Wheatears bob along in front, flashing their white undercarriage and the high hill country opens up around you. In the distance you can see the Celtic cross that marks the site of the monastery of Kildonan. It was here that St Donan and his brotherhood of 52 monks set up home. The queen took exception to this invasion of her island and sought revenge in a fashion typical of the bloody history of the Highlands by chopping off the monks’ heads after mass.The loch appears as the main track veers away to climb the summit. Follow a sheep track through the heather to the little mirrored bowl set within the hills. According to the story, after murdering the monks, the queen and her followers saw lights appear in the sky and followed these across the moors to this spot where they were led into the water and drowned while attempting to reach the tiny island in the centre. Carol Donaldson, writer and conservationist, is the author of On the Marshes (Little Toller Books, £10)Lengthtime 7.1 miles, 4 hoursStartfinish Cow and Calf Rocks car parkRefuel Cow and Calf CafeIlkley Moor, or Rombald’s Moor as it’s officially titled, has always loomed large in my world. I grew up in an old house on its north-west edge, and lived in its shadow until I was 23. Its wild, heathery expanses, niches of wood, hidden streams and peat bogs were a playground for us kids. From bronze age cup-and-ring carvings to stone circles, alien sightings to tales of Charles Darwin taking its waters – the moor’s histories and myths seized our imaginations as surely as the landscape got in our blood.Now, whenever I return to walk this seven-mile circular, it feels no less eerie and spectacular – a place that can change in a moment, yet remain timeless. At the age of 17, half-cut and showing off, I carved my name on that moor but Ilkley Moor had carved itself into me long before.Start at the Cow and Calf Rocks car park, scrambling up the easy climb inside the gritstone quarry or taking the footpath around it. The expansive views of the River Wharfe and the Yorkshire Dales have been a magnet for centuries, as the rock graffiti testifies. Look for “E M Lancaster, 1st Battalion XXIV Foot, 1882” – chiselled a few years after that regiment fought at Rorke’s Drift. Once up, follow the footpath left to wind on to moor proper.Head towards The Haystack, a slab of rock covered with some of the 400 neolithic and bronze age cup-and-ring marks on this moor. While the town below dates its origins to a first century AD Roman cavalry fort, these patterns are 4,000 years old. It’s the same with the Twelve Apostles – a restored stone circle, another 20 minutes further south along a boardwalk path, on Burley Moor.Double back and carry straight on through Ilkley Crags before turning left and following the footpath west. This is heather and bracken upland country that turns a gorgeous russet and rust-brown under autumn skies, and where you can hear curlews – especially now the moor’s grouse shooting license has been revoked. Drop down to the Swastika Stone, overlooking the valley. This ancient curved-limb cup-and-ring carving used to be thought of as bronze age but its striking similarity to the Camunian Rose means it was most likely carved by a Roman soldier stationed at Ilkley.Trek back east along the footpath over town, looking for a white dot up on the moor line. White Wells is a relic of Ilkley’s boomtown past as a spa resort with its own, freezing cold, peat-brown dipping pool for the brave. It was here that Charles Darwin rambled, hid out and took the waters when On the Origin of Species was published in 1859. It was here, too, that in 1987 a retired copper photographed what he believed to be an alien being, which beckoned him away before vanishing in a UFO. Apparently, the incident has yet to be exposed as a hoax, which lends the moors an even greater air of mystery.Follow the path up top and open your stride all the way back to the Cow and Calf car park, tracing the footsteps of the mill-working Methodists from Halifax who, on a chapel outing to the moor, created Yorkshire’s anthem, On Ilkla Moor Baht ’At, about the perils of courting without appropriate headgear. Time it right and there’ll be an amazing autumn sunset as you take a restorative tea in the car park cafe, or something stronger in the pub across the road.Rob Cowen, award-winning writer and author of Common Ground, voted the UK’s third-favourite nature book in 2018Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Here’s why it’s one of 2018’s hidden gemsThis month’s Sunday night viewing wars have given us a heroic clash of mettle on mettle. While most viewers sided with BBC1’s Bodyguard, I’ve pinned my colours to ITV’s adaptation of Vanity Fair.Both are masterclasses in sexual politics, but whereas Jed Mercurio’s pairing of a lonely home secretary with her physically and psychologically scarred minder led us up an implausible cul-de-sac, William Thackeray commands the heights of social satire with a story that, to co-opt one of his most famous pronouncements, “gives back to every era the reflection of its own face”.It’s a familiar complaint that no film or TV version can live up to the novel, because none can be so unremittingly nasty. But before dismissing this latest adaptation, it is worth bearing in mind the less familiar second part of that mirror quote: “Frown at it and it will in turn look sourly upon you laugh at it and with it, and it is a jolly kind companion.” Ever since Chester M Franklin’s expressionist 1932 version brought Vanity Fair into the age of the talkies, with Myrna Loy as a hollow-eyed casino hustler bound for a tragic end, interpretations have lined up along the spectrum this quote suggests.The tone is always set by Becky Sharp herself, who has become increasingly impossible to caricature over the decades, as a low-born orphan battling the disadvantages of class and gender. The more extreme the scenario, the harder it is for an actor to get their claws into the role – witness Reese Witherspoon, left with nowhere to go but nice, against the flamboyant colonial ghastliness of Mira Nair and Julian Fellowes’ 2004 movie version.Writer Gwyneth Hughes gets round this by emphasising the illusory nature of the story, as did Thackeray himself, opening each episode with a top-hatted Michael Palin directing the revolutions of a gilded merry-go-round. It is a different sort of textual faithfulness than the usual deployment of the costume department’s finest regimental scarlets to the mustering scenes, although this series does that too. It is a faithfulness to Thackeray’s tone, to his direct address to the reader, which draws us into complicity with his God’s-eye view of the human comedy.Awareness of this artifice is kept going with knowing camera work: Olivia Cooke’s Becky might be as fresh-faced and charismatic as they come, but she stands apart from her companions in being allowed regularly to break the fourth wall with conspiratorial glances. The key early encounters with the snobbish parents of her schoolfriend, Amelia, set up a double irony as she is stared down by Sam, the Sedleys’ black servant.Richie Campbell’s Sam is a revelation: a proud and contemptuous figure who slips across the background of a scene in which Becky boasts to her new friends that her mother was a Montmorency. He also usurps her first attempt to entrap the tubby Collector of Boggley Wollah, by bursting into the room with a towering gateau.In true Thackeray style, the more ridiculous a character, the more odious their hypocrisies. David Fynn’s sneezing and stammering Jos Sedley is on the verge of becoming the pitiable victim of Becky’s wiles when his social floundering inflates into drunken monstrosity. It gets worse when Becky is exiled to the rundown Pitt Crawley mansion, where she faces down the advances of Martin Clunes’s gurning Worzel Gummidge of a baronet and the bossy pieties of his son and daughter-in-law, only to find herself enveloped in the toxic confidence of the vicious Aunt Matilda, who is gloriously played by Frances de la Tour as a gleefully vicious toad in a mobcap. Perhaps she’s a warning of what Becky might become, given too much of the worldly power she so desires.All comic grotesques need their stooges – and this is the hardest position to hold in such a vicious satire. After a queasy initial backstairs encounter, the romance between Becky and Tom Bateman’s Rawdon is played pretty straight: here, it’s clear, is a match both of libidos and lusts for life. As such it’s in counterpoint to the peevish alliance of Claudia Jessie’s fluttery Amelia and Charlie Rowe’s puppyish George, whose ardour seems as limp as the bouquet he thrusts at Becky as battle looms on the night of the regimental ball in Belgium. (Bouquets, rather wonderfully, seem to be enacting a shadow drama of their own in the first four episodes.)Where, quite, this all leaves Dobbin, the faithful friend and constant lover, remains to be seen. Johnny Flynn doesn’t aspire to the the bruised charisma of Philip Glenister in the 1998 BBC mini-series (scripted by Andrew Davies). So far, he’s a colourless character, whose occasional clumsiness seems incidental rather than a defining – and endearing – trait. Perhaps it’s not the social climbing woman, but the honourable man who has a hard time finding his reflection in the mirror of the current era. But Dobbin has another two episodes in which to press his suit and we shall all just have to wait and see."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d87e509831f6c3cf7a2660b34f9e9fa53b405f6/0_125_3396_2036/master/3396.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8beef20343f1b055d8982e79772e5146","title":"jacinda ardern makes history with baby neve at un general assembly","story":"New Zealand prime minister is the first female world leader to bring an infant to the meeting in New YorkNew Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern has made history as the first female world leader to attend the United Nations general assembly meeting with her newborn baby in tow.Ardern appeared with her infant daughter at the UN on Monday evening, and played with her before giving a speech at the Nelson Mandela peace summit. While she spoke, Ardern’s partner Clarke Gayford held the three-month-old baby on his lap.Ardern gave birth to Neve Te Aroha at Auckland Hospital on 21 June and returned to work in early August after taking six weeks maternity leave.The prime minister is continuing to breastfeed her daughter, meaning Neve had to travel with her to New York for the six-day trip.Asked by the Today show on the US NBC network if it was harder to govern New Zealand or take her daughter on a 17-hour flight, Ardern responded with a laugh and said “It felt at the time on par” and said she had apologised to her fellow passengers in advance.Ardern revealed that juggling parenthood and the prime ministership had “met my expectations” but the joy she felt at Neve “had far surpassed my expectations”.Ardern’s partner Clarke Gayford – a fishing television presenter – is Neve’s primary carer, and has travelled with Ardern to New York to look after the baby.Last week the rules were tweaked in New Zealand to allow the prime minister or ministers to travel with a nanny on overseas assignments, and have this covered by the taxpayer.However, Ardern said Gayford’s tickets to New York and expenses would be paid for out of her own pocket, because there were few official spousal engagements Gayford would be required to attend, and most of his time would be taken up caring for Neve.Gayford posted a photo on Twitter on Monday of Neve’s security pass, which reads “first baby”.He added: “I wish I could have captured the startled look on a Japanese delegation inside UN yesterday who walked into a meeting room in the middle of a nappy change. Great yarn for her 21st (birthday).”Ardern has earned a reputation as a frugal leader who recently froze MPs salaries for a year and makes her ministers carpool to events.“There is no spousal programme for this, so we just made a judgment call that we would cover his travel for this trip. He will be going to some things, but he’s primarily travelling to care for Neve,” Ardern told the New Zealand Herald.Ardern said they had not committed to taking their daughter to any official events, and they were “playing it by ear” depending on how she was affected by the travel. “There is no set plan, it’s just whether or not she’s getting enough sleep, where I am for feeds. They might be with us a lot, they might just be in the hotel.“It depends what the jet lag does to them both. She’s a good sleeper and we don’t know whether that will mean she ends up sleeping a lot in the day rather than the night.”On Sunday, Ardern gave her first speech in New York at Unicef’s social good summit, restating her commitment to ending child poverty and making her country the best place in the world to be a child.Ardern’s fellow panellists commented on how peaceful Neve was waiting backstage with her father and Ardern joked that she “wasn’t at 3:30 this morning”.“I have the ability to take my child to work, there’s not many places you can do that. I am not the gold standard for bringing up a child in this current environment because there are things about my circumstances that are not the same,” Ardern said.Ardern outlined the exceptional circumstances that make it possible for her to raise Neve while continuing as prime minister, which she has frequently stated she hopes will one day be the norm for all women wanting to balance a career and parenting.“If I can do one thing, and that is change the way we think about these things, then I will be pleased we have achieved something.”Former Pakistani prime minister Benzir Bhutto is the only other world leader to give birth while in office when she had a baby girl in January 1990.

But, as I say, she hasn’t had that conversation with me yet.”Mr Murphy told RTÉ\u0027s Morning Ireland this morning that he hoped to meet Ms Byrne before the vote. I hope that she won\u0027t be pulled into this Sinn\u0026nbspFéin stunt later this evening, he said.\u0026nbspThe reports of Ms Byrne’s potential defection on Monday prompted a flurry of headcounts in Government Buildings.There is scheduled to be an incorporeal Cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning – with Ministers contacted by telephone to secure their assent for a decision – to approve a counter-motion expressing confidence in the Minister for Housing.Tuesday’s regular Cabinet meeting has been postponed until Thursday due to Mr Varadkar being in New York.Mr Varadkar’s comments follow reports that Ms Byrne was considering voting against her colleague, after differences between the two over a large affordable housing scheme in her constituency. Ms Byrne is a Minister of State at the Department of Health and a TD for Dublin South Central.Mr Varadkar said he would meet Ms Byrne when he returned from the US on Tuesday. A spokesman for Mr Murphy said he was also likely to meet Ms Byrne.Ms Byrne surprised Mr Murphy by publicly opposing a new housing scheme in Inchicore at its launch. His plans for the site would see the construction of about 470 homes, 30 of which would be used for social housing with 60 per cent available on a cost rental basis, for rent to low- and middle-income workers.Speaking at the event, Mr Murphy said the development would be a “game changer” for the rental market. However, at the event, Ms Byrne said it was “probably one of the worst plans” she had seen for the site. She has since continued to campaign against the proposals.But yesterday the Taoiseach gave his backing to Mr Murphy, saying it was often the case that Ministers had objections to developments in their own areas, but “it is Government policy to build new houses”.“We’re in a housing crisis, we need to build lots of new houses. It’s Government policy to have high-density housing nearer to our cities and it’s Government policy to have mixed housing, social housing, affordable housing.”Ms Byrne was uncontactable last night and did not respond to a message. However in a statement on Twitter last night, Ms Byrne she said she wanted to see St Michael’s Estate developed but did not believe a high-density apartment block was the right choice.

The State’s top civil servant, Mr Fraser, appeared before a Dáil committee for its controversial examination of spending in the President’s office despite querying its standing and constitutionality.Before the hearing began, PAC chairman Seán Fleming warned the other eight members present that questions relating to the President himself were “not in order”.Mr Fraser and Comptroller and Auditor General Seamus McCarthy both made very brief opening remarks. Mr McCarthy said the costs of the President’s Office in 2016 were €3.6 million of which €1.15 was allotted to centenarians who received a bonus on reaching 100 years of age. He said the surplus recorded was €287,000.Mr Fraser said he did not have too much to add to what Mr McCarthy said other than to say that the costs for 2017 were about €3.7million.Bobby Aylward of Fianna Fáil said that the overall spend was much higher as the costs did not reflect the expenditure of the Garda Síochána and the Department of Foreign Affairs, which looked after travel by the President. Mr McCarthy said the total costs amounted to €8.2 million.When asked about travel expenses by Mr Aylward, Mr Fraser said that foreign travel arrangements were made by the Department of Foreign Affairs and by the host country, which had to look at procedures, logistics, security and location. He said that his role as accounting officer for the President’s office was different as there was a delicate relationship with the President’s Office because of the separation of powers, and it was with the greatest reluctance he would intervene in its operations. However, he said if there was an audit report that gave rise to concern, he would have to take it up with officials in the office. Under questioning by Catherine Connolly, Mr Fraser said the internal audit committee set up in 2014 did not meet because the chairman was indisposed. Asked if any internal audit work had taken place, Mr Fraser said he had relied on the Comptroller and Auditor General. Ms Connolly said that was an end of year report and put it to him there was no internal audit work. Mr Fraser accepted the situation was sub optima and he did not deny it but pointed to the circumstances.He disclosed a new chairman of the audit committee had not been appointed until February of 2018 and it had met three times since then and developed an audit programme. Mr Fraser said it was Joe Hanlon, former secretary General of the Department of the Gaeltacht. When he was unable to say the dates on which it had met, Ms Connolly said that he should know the dates as it revolved around the governance of accountability of funding money.

Photograph: Pau BarrenaAFPGetty ImagesManuel Valls was born 56 years ago in Barcelona, but his Swiss mother and Catalan father, a well-known painter, moved to Paris to escape Franco’s rule. He was naturalised a French citizen at the age of 20 and rose through the ranks of the socialist party to become François Hollande’s interior minister (2012-2014), then prime minister (2014-2016).Now, in what may prove to be an unprecedented act of self-reinvention and political resurrection, Valls is set to announce his candidacy to become mayor of Barcelona at a “civic event” at the Centre of Contemporary Culture in Barcelona on Tuesday evening.No head of a European government has pursued a political career in another EU country. The closest parallels are the 19th-century statesman Giuseppe Garibaldi, who was born in Nice and served in both the Italian and French parliaments, and Daniel Cohn-Bendit, who was elected four times an MEP, twice as a German and twice as a French man.Valls says his interest in the Barcelona town hall is “an illustration of European citizenship”. Whether or not he wins, it may be a one-way trip. His prolonged absence has angered fellow deputies in the French National Assembly. And constituents in the Paris suburb of Evry, who Valls represented since 2002, feel abandoned. \u0026nbspWhile Valls spent more and more time in Barcelona this year, “nobody was in charge here”, a retired woman in Evry told Le Parisien newspaper. “The politicians all take us for fools. They ask us to vote for them, and then a year later they go away ... ”When Valls visited then taoiseach Enda Kenny in Dublin in April 2015, many French people fervently hoped for a presidential contest between Valls and the conservative politician Alain Juppé. It never happened. Rarely has such a promising political career fizzled out so inauspiciously.As interior minister, Valls had been the scourge of itinerant Roma. In the midst of jihadist attacks, his rhetoric was interpreted as Islamophobic. Things started going wrong for Valls when he took his sons on a government jet to a football match in Berlin. He was perceived as ill-tempered and over-ambitious.In a humiliating blow, Valls was defeated in the socialist presidential primary in January 2017. He nearly lost the seat he had held for 15 years in subsequent legislative elections, scraping through by only 139 votes over his far-left challenger from the France Unbowed party.Valls’s Catalan critics say he has come to Barcelona only because he was shoved aside by President Emmanuel Macron. Sources close to both politicians confirm the deep antipathy between them.When Macron was economy minister under Valls, he blamed Valls for gutting his reforms of bus transport and Sunday trading, then depriving Macron of the satisfaction of a parliamentary vote by passing his law by decree.It was a nightmare for Valls to see the young upstart with virtually no political experience snatch France’s highest political office from under his nose. To add insult to injury, Macron refused to allow Valls to stand for the National Assembly on the En Marche! ticket.Both Macron and Valls are pro-European social democrats who have been accused of veering to the right. Like Macron, Valls says the left-right ide in politics is outdated. Valls’s campaign in Barcelona looks set to mimic Macron’s winning formula.The centre-right Spanish party Ciudadanos (Citizens) supports Valls, but he may prefer to stand as an independent, in the hope of winning votes across as broad a spectrum as possible.A year after the referendum on Catalan independence, most of the leaders of the separatist movement are in prison or in exile, like the former president of the region, Carles Puigdemont, who lives in Belgium. Pro-Spanish Catalans believe they have found an articulate spokesman in Valls.Valls’s private life has followed the twists and turns of his political career. He had four children with his first wife, a school teacher. He and his second wife, a concert violinist, announced they were orcing last April. Valls had a brief liaison with the spokeswoman for the En Marche! group in the National Assembly.Then he was introduced to Susana Gallardo (53), the fabulously wealthy heiress to the Almirall pharmaceutical fortune and ex-wife of the owner of the Pronovias chain of wedding dress stores.Gallardo owns a mansion in Menorca and an apartment in Barcelona, where Valls now lives. Like Valls, she is a passionate advocate of Spanish unity. Valls’s detractors back in Paris say Gallardo’s influence and contacts book may be the most attractive things about her."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3639723.1537798381!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"explainer has michael atiyah conquered the everest of mathematics","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn undated portrait of German mathematician Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866). Riemann established the foundations of modern differential geometry and, in 1859, formulated the hypothesis that bears his name.  Photograph: BettmannGetty ImagesA major mathematical result has been announced by British-Lebanese mathematician Sir Michael Atiyah. In a talk at the 6th Heidelberg Laureate Forum in Germany on Monday Atiyah outlined what he described as “a simple proof using a radically new approach” of the Riemann hypothesis – the most celebrated problem in modern mathematics.The Riemann hypothesis (RH) was highlighted by the great German mathematician David Hilbert at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900. Hilbert remarked: “If I were to awaken after sleeping for a thousand years, my first question would be: Has the Riemann hypothesis been proven?” The proof (or refutation) may come tomorrow, or we may have to wait for a century or more. The Riemann hypothesis is the Everest of mathematics.When asked which mathematicians he most admired, Atiyah named Bernhard Riemann and Irishman William Rowan Hamilton. Riemann established the foundations of modern differential geometry and, in 1859, formulated the hypothesis that bears his name. His work had a profound influence on the mathematics of the 20th century. He was very far in advance of his times, a deep and innovative mathematician. Riemannian geometry was the framework for Einstein’s theory of general relativity. Hamilton formulated what we call Hamiltonian mechanics, and invented quaternions. All the numbers we are familiar with, the “real numbers”, can be arranged as points on a line. But we can also consider points in a plane these give a richer set of numbers, the complex numbers. Each point in the plane has co-ordinates (a, b) and it was Hamilton who first gave the rules for multiplying pairs of numbers. This led him on to the more complicated quaternions numbers in four-dimensional space. It is obvious that x - 4 is zero when x  4. We say that the function f (x)  x - 4 has a zero at x  4. You may recall solving quadratic equations at school: these have two zeros. The Riemann zeta function is much trickier, and has an infinity of zeros. This function, defined by Riemann, takes a value for each point in the complex plane. Some of these values are zero: the negative even numbers, -2, -4, and so on all yield zero. Riemann believed the remaining zeros are on a vertical line, the critical line, in the complex plane. This is the Riemann hypothesis which, despite strenuous efforts, has never been proven. The RH can be formulated in erse and seemingly unrelated ways, some of which look deceptively simple: many statements equivalent to RH involve only real numbers. The hypothesis is inextricably intertwined with the distribution of prime numbers (primes cannot be expressed as products of smaller numbers), and the proof would have major consequences in number theory. Michael Berry of Bristol University encapsulates the hypothesis in the phrase “the primes have music in them”.Born in London in 1929, Atiyah was awarded a doctorate at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1955 for a thesis entitled Some Applications of Topological Methods in Algebraic Geometry. One of the leading mathematicians of the 20th century and still at the coal-face, Atiyah has spent most of his academic life in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966 and the Abel Prize in 2004. Both of these awards are considered comparable to a Nobel Prize. His main interests have been in algebraic geometry, index theory and gauge theory. His best known result, the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, proved in 1963, makes connections between geometry and quantum field theory. He has collaborated with many leading mathematicians and his work has revealed important interactions between geometry and physics. The proof presented by Atiyah depends on a new function called the Todd function, and is underpinned by ideas introduced by John von Neumann, a giant among 20th century mathematics. In his analytical theory, von Neumann introduced “the infinite iteration of exponentials”. The Todd function is related to the fine structure constant of fundamental physics, and Atiyah said that he “stumbled upon the proof” of RH while studying the fine structure constant. The proof is by contradiction: Atiyah assumes a zero off the critical line and shows that this leads to an impossible result. Therefore, the hypothesis must be true and the theorem is proved! Proof of RH has been outstanding for 160 years. Many reputable mathematicians have attempted and failed to prove it. Atiyah’s result, if right, would be a dramatic breakthrough. There is very little chance that he is correct: major proofs normally require large advances in understanding, while Atiyah has claimed a “simple proof”. His outline may lead to a complete proof or, more likely, may amount to nothing. In recent years, Atiyah has claimed to have proved other remarkable results but has failed to convince his peers. It seems incredible that Atiyah is right, but we will have to await the judgment of experts before we learn if he will collect the $1 million Millennium Prize.Prof Peter Lynch writes the That’s Maths column on The  science page and is emeritus professor at UCD School of Mathematics \u0026amp Statistics"},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn we re ready for a general election","story":"  September 23, 2018Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson said the party must back members on new Brexit vote   September 23, 2018Agreement should have \u0026lsquosame benefits\u0026rsquo as customs union and single market membership   September 24, 2018Delegates at party conference on Tuesday are expected to support another referendum "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3639707.1537798749!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"world of maths aflutter over new proof of 160 year old hypothesis","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish-Lebanese mathematician Michael Atiyah giving a lecture on the Riemann hypothesis on Monday at the Heidelberg Laureates Forum in Germany. Screengrab: YouTubeThe 90-year-old mathematician Michael Atiyah has presented what he referred to as a “simple proof” of the Riemann hypothesis, a problem which has eluded mathematicians for almost 160 years.The world of maths and the Twitter-sphere have been a frenzy ever since the British-Lebanese mathematician indicated he was to give a lecture on Monday at the Heidelberg Laureates Forum in Germany on what is widely regarded as the most important outstanding problem in maths.Although it is almost incomprehensible for people without intensive maths training, the hypothesis describes the distribution of prime numbers among positive integers.Prime numbers, very simple by definition, are the building blocks of modern mathematics, especially number theory. Achievements in prime number theory have been widely applied to computer sciences and telecommunications.However prime numbers are also mysterious and inexplicable – the pattern in which prime numbers emerge in the line of positive integers has remained elusive to generations of mathematicians.Riemann proposed a theory that can, in a way, shed light on that mystery but he could not prove it, nor could all the brilliant minds that came after.If a solution to the Riemann hypothesis is confirmed, it would be big news as mathematicians would be armed with a map to the location of all such prime numbers a breakthrough with far-reaching repercussions in the field.Atiyah, who specialises in geometry, is one of the UK’s most eminent mathematical figures, having received the two awards often referred to as the Nobel prizes of mathematics the Fields Medal and the Abel Prize.As one of the six unsolved “Clay Millennium Problems”, any solution would be eligible for a $1 million prize. This has tempted many mathematicians over the years, none of which has yet been awarded the prize.Atiyah is well aware of this history of failure. “Nobody believes any proof of the Riemann hypothesis, let alone a proof by someone who’s 90,” he said, but he hoped his presentation would convince his critics.In it, he paid tribute to the work of two great 20th century mathematicians, John von Neumann and Friedrich Hirzebruch, whose developments he claims laid the foundations for his own proposed proof. “It fell into my lap, I had to pick it up,” he said in advance of giving his talk.He has produced a number of papers in recent years making remarkable claims which have so far failed to convince his peers.“People say ‘we know mathematicians do all their best work before they’re 40’,” Atiyah said recently. “I’m trying to show them that they’re wrong. That I can do something when I’m 90.”Irish mathematician Prof Peter Lynch of UCD, who tuned into the talk, said in his view there was very little chance that Atiyah was correct: “Major proofs normally require large advances in understanding, while Atiyah has claimed a ‘simple proof’. His outline may lead to a complete proof or, more likely, may amount to nothing.”To win a millennium prize the solution has to be considered valid for a period of two years – though other mathematicians are likely to give their verdict in coming weeks.The Clay Millennium Prizes, announced in 2000, were conceived to record seven of the most difficult problems with which mathematicians were grappling at the turn of the second millennium.They were also designed “to elevate in the consciousness of the general public the fact that in mathematics, the frontier is still open and abounds in important unsolved problems to emphasise the importance of working towards a solution of the deepest, most difficult problems and to recognise achievement in mathematics of historical magnitude”."},{"url":null,"title":"vladimir putin russias action man president in pictures","story":"Vladimir Putin\u0027s Kremlin press office has cultivated a swashbuckling image over the many years he has been in power.

If these targets are not achieved the council may be fined.”It said the trial of four-weekly collections led to a 14 percent increase in recycling and a 31 percent decrease in the amount of rubbish discarded in wheelie bins.The council put extra measures in place to help residents recycle, including free collection of large items, free nappy bins for grandparents who look after children and bespoke collections for those who miss bin collections if they are on holiday.Three and four-weekly bin collections were non-existent until 201415, when two councils adopted the system, data from waste charity Wrap has shown.Homeowners risk \u0026#039wasting their time\u0026#039 recycling because of confusion over what can be recycledIn 200910, some 245 councils organised weekly bin collections, a figure which has fallen by 34 per cent to 160. This is despite vigorous campaigning by waste activists and this newspaper to preserve a weekly service.Over the same period the number of fortnightly collections has risen by 38 per cent from 219 to 303 councils.  Meanwhile, it emerged last week that cling film, plant pots and takeaway trays are being recycled by less than 10 per cent of councils.Data from Wrap showed that local authorities have drastically different recycling regimes, under which some households are able to recycle different items to others.It means some households may be wasting their time trying to recycle some items marked as recyclable because they are unaware their council cannot recycle it.Three councils - Rotherham, the Isles of Scilly, and Tonbridge and Malling - do not recycle plastic at all.The Government is consulting on an overhaul of the recycling regime in the hope of improving recycling rates.Please review our commenting policyLabour could extend Article 50 as Theresa May accused of \u0026#39failing in mission\u0026#39 - latest newsSocial media is \u0026#39like heroin\u0026#39 for children - but Silicon Valley engineers don\u0026#39t realise as they\u0026#39re in their 20s and childless, ex-Google Design Ethicist claimsThe Apprentice 2018, first look review: more tattoos and piercings but otherwise it\u0026#39s business as usual in Lord Sugar\u0026#39s bored roomWreck of 400-year-old spice trade ship found off coast of Portugal in \u0026#39discovery of a decade\u0026#39New Zealand\u0026#39s \u0026#39First Baby\u0026#39 Neve makes history with United Nations debut alongside Jacinda ArdernContaminated blood victims: How lives have been torn apart - their own wordsPls Like, series two, review: brilliant YouTube satire moves into darker territoryBodies of British businessman and his Thai wife found after alleged contract killing ordered by woman\u0026#39s brotherFrom Bodyguard to Elton John\u0026#39s lover: Richard Madden\u0026#39s surprising next roleRNLI rescue woman clinging to river Thames ladder with her stranded dogUS midterm elections 2018 poll tracker: Who will win the Congress?What to expect from Donald Trump\u0026#39s speech at the United Nations general assemblySwedish Prime Minister to stand down after losing confidence voteUS Midterm elections 2018: Why this year\u0026#39s congressional elections matterComment: Politicians shun England\u0026#39s working-class Brexiteer towns at their perilComment: Brett Kavanaugh\u0026#39s TV denial will rile Democrats and delight TrumpChina says it can\u0026#39t hold US trade talks with \u0026#39knife to the throat\u0026#39Lonely over-50s set to hit two million within seven yearsMichael Gove calls for a third of the world\u0026#39s oceans to be given protected status to save marine lifeComment: We celebrate peace, as well as loss, at the Cenotaph.

She is only the second leader in modern history to give birth while in office, after Pakistan\u0027s Benazir Bhutto in 1990.Ms Ardern said she and her partner made “a very practical decision” to take Neve with them into the United Nations summit in New York.“Neve is actually nearby me most of the time in New Zealand, she\u0027s just not always caught,” she said.Clarke Gayford holds baby Neve while Jacinda Ardern speaks at the Nelson Mandela Peace SummitBut here when she\u0027s awake we try and keep her with me so obviously that was the occasion.”A United Nations spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, said the organisation was delighted to see Neve in the General Assembly hall.“Prime Minister Ardern is showing that no one is better qualified to represent her country than a working mother,” he said.“Just five  percent of the world’s leaders are women, so we need to make them as welcome here as possible.”Jacinda Ardern addresses the Nelson Mandela Peace SummitMs Ardern has been feted by the United States media during her visit and appeared on NBC’s Today Show shortly after her arrival.

The high street store called on the government to provide more clarity about its planning, in order to enable it to make suitable arrangements. The company said the “indirect risk of interruption to the smooth operation of our ports represents the biggest risk to our business from Brexit”. According to Next, there is “no reason why goods should not flow with relatively little friction through customs from the EU”, but “the issue will be the preparedness of the UK authorities and UK businesses”.Another risk the company is facing is volatility in the pound. In a bid to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations, Next has secured exchange rates in US dollars, its most important trading currency, for the next two years. In 2018, the costing rate is $1.29 per £1, and in 2019 the company expects to get $1.33 per £1. In early trading on Tuesday, the pound was at $1.31. Next said its decision to hedge exposure to the pound means it is not expecting any cost price inflation over the next 18 months.

The group now expects retail sales to account for less than half of group sales for the year in full. Pre-tax profit edged up by 0.5 per cent to £311m.

The information will be presented in graphs, and users are offered the ability to ban themselves from specific apps, for instance.But those charts – intended as a way of allowing people to better control their use of their phone – have turned out to be more than a little horrifying to many users. Many appear to have used their last few minutes of available time to tweet about just how miserable their incessant tweeting is making them.Others embraced ignorance as a way of avoiding the horrifying graphs.Many found, however that the feature is actually working – despite or perhaps because of the feelings of shame. The feature was introduced by Apple as a way of allowing people to use their phone for what they actually want to do, which appears to be paying off.One important group affected by the changes are children. Apple allows the Screen Time feature to be controlled within families – meaning, for instance, that parents can set limits for their children, who can ask for more time if they need it.Screen Time is just one of a vast range of features introduced in iOS 12, Apple\u0027s latest iPhone update. They also include other features intended on improving people\u0027s relationship with their phone, including alterations to the way notifications work.The feature should nudge users into using it when the latest update is installed.

It might be well worth waiting for: it has many of the same features as the Xs, but starts at £749 rather than £999.)Here are the various ways to buy an iPhone Xs now.Buying a phone is not necessarily the cheapest way of buying an iPhone, and it requires you to have the most amount of money to hand. But the flip side is that you get everything sorted out in one go, you won\u0027t have payments hanging over your head, and you\u0027re free to do what you want with the phone.iPhone XS launch in September 2018111 Tim Cook speaks about the iPhone XS and XS MaxTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone XS and XS Max at an Apple Inc product launch event 211 Tim Cook speaking at the iPhone launchTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks on stage at the end of the Apple Inc311 Tim Cook speaking during the event411 Phil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketingPhil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, speaks about the Apple iPhone XS and Apple iPhone XS Max511 Phil Schiller speaks about the new iPhone XRPhilip W.

So it can be worth going through your network, and paying upfront for the phone with them while still committing to a phone plan.If you\u0027re on the other side of that situation – you don\u0027t want to pay upfront at all, and offset the cost through the length of the plan – then there are plenty of ways to do that. Obviously, you will pay for it in that the price over the two years will add up to significantly more, but you\u0027ll also have the benefit of never having to make such a significant outlay.There are plenty of networks offering limited upfront payments, such as Virgin Mobile, which claims to have the cheapest deal with no upfront costs. You can get the Xs for £41 per month without any initial payment, and pay an extra £9 for a full 50GB per month.The least painful way to get the iPhone Xs or Xs Max is probably to go somewhere in between. Which is best will depend on how much you want to pay upfront and what sort of allowances you want, of course, but the networks are falling over themselves to offer you deals on the new phone.Three, for instance, is asking for £59 for all you can eat data with a £99 payment at the beginning. It\u0027s not the cheapest deal, but unlimited data is rare, and it is decent.The Max is £5 more from Three. And you can add another £6 on top per month to get some AirPods, too.If you\u0027re concerned about committing for two years – especially when next year\u0027s iPhone is likely to offer more spectacular upgrades than the Xs – then you might want to consider Sky Mobile, which allows people to upgrade every year with its Swap12 plan.\u0026nbspThe Xs starts at £59 per month on that plan, with a £99 upfront payment.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/17/11/aran-islands-cart-1950s-ireland.jpg","title":"travel ireland aran islands visit travel accommodation to do remote","story":"Created with Sketch.At the end of the 19th\u0026nbspcentury, playwright JM Synge\u0026nbspescaped to the\u0026nbspstripped back and simple life on\u0026nbspInishmore, Inishmaan\u0026nbspand Inisheer. Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”We both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in picturesPope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/23/13/lebanon-beach-2-0.jpg","title":"women only beach lebanon beirut muslim islam","story":"Created with Sketch.On Beirut\u0027s ladies\u0027 beaches, Muslim women who don\u0027t otherwise show their bodies in public can feel the sun and sea on their skinClick to followThe IndependentFor many observant Muslim women, a mixed-gender beach is to be avoidedThey call it the ladies’ beach.

All around them, gallons of tanning oil glistens on acres of copper skin.When a man on a jet ski buzzes past, a female lifeguard warns him off with a staccato of whistle blasts.“Men,” says Nada, a school bus supervisor from Beirut who was treading the Mediterranean just offshore, “are suffocating.In Lebanon, a sliver of a country on the Mediterranean coast where summer sticks to your skin like moist Saran wrap, the beach is less a luxury than a utility. It is hard to imagine going without.Public and pay-by-the-day beaches line the coast from Tyre in the south to Tripoli in the north, and every other billboard on the highways out of Beirut seems to display a bikini model promoting a tanning aid\u0026nbsp(SPF, evidently, is not in style).But many observant Muslim women consider it haram – forbidden – to expose their bodies in front of men who are not their husbands or, in some cases, close relatives. Other women may cover themselves in deference to conservative families and communities.For them, a mixed-gender beach is to be avoided those who go with their families roast in the sun fully clothed in hijabs and long-sleeved shirts and pants or abayas, the full-length caftans popular among devout Lebanese Muslim women.Hence the emergence of ladies’ beaches like this one, the Bellevue Beach Club in the seaside town of Jiyeh – a salt-tinged hiatus from the male gaze for $18 (£14) a day, just 20 minutes down a trash-perfumed highway from Beirut.AFPGetty)It is a dedicated patch of sand for conservative women amid the cultural melange of Lebanon, which, with its 18 recognised religious sects and vigorous all-night party scene, tends to be more socially liberal than other Arab countries.At the Bellevue, there seemed to be as many different degrees of scanty cladding as there were women. For some women, religious scruples argued for more coverage. For others, style considerations, and the heat, argued for less. Each woman had made her own peace with the proportions.“Here, I’m free to be me,” says Rabab Amhaz, 35, a housewife from the inland Bekaa Valley. She gestures\u0026nbspto her tankini, bright with a teal floral pattern, and shimmies\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspthe water.Seeking a second opinion on her beach visit, she had consulted her brother, a Hezbollah fighter. He had not only given her his blessing but shown her a YouTube video of a Muslim cleric explaining that swimwear was acceptable among women, so long as the women covered their lower bodies.Nada, who began wearing the veil when she married at age 14, dismisses\u0026nbspthis assessment: you could find a cleric to say anything you wanted, she says.Following her own strong conviction that all the skin on display around her was forbidden (who knew who might be watching from one of the boats that periodically splashed by, or from behind the walls of the resort?),\u0026nbspshe had looked at herself in the mirror that morning and changed into a more modest bottom. She also declined to reveal her last name to a reporter, preferring to avoid the prospect of disapproval at home.But a swimsuit was a swimsuit – in this case, a black-and-white patterned swim tank with black shorts.Syrian refugee in Lebanon: Education is the foundation of my dreamsSara, 11, is a Syrian refugee living in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley in an informal tented settlement.

She does\u0026nbspnot want her sons or grandsons to get used to seeing women’s bodies.But still. “I love to swim,” she says, smiling and shrugging, “so I have no other choice.”Nada and Amhaz agree\u0026nbspon one point: absolutely no beach selfies, not even to share with their husbands.“No, no!” they exclaim, high-fiving.Cameras are banned, the better to protect the beachgoers’ modesty and privacy, though cellphones are not. But visits to several other Lebanese resorts, undertaken purely for journalistic purposes, suggest\u0026nbspfew other differences between women-only beaches and mixed ones beyond the obvious.No matter the setting, gossip and hookah pipes scent the air. Snacks, water and shade are at a premium. People-watching is frequently rewarding.Several ladies’ beaches fringe the coastline south of Beirut, their names redolent of sandy glamour around the world (the Laguna the Bondi). The Bellevue Beach Club began offering women-only days in the mid-1990s after veiled women began asking for privacy.Business was good – better than on mixed days, even. It soon went all women, all the time.A man collects tickets, but no other males are allowed. Women staff the restrooms and the pool. The staff includes the Australian and Filipino wives of the brothers who run the Bellevue, who go to mixed beaches together.There is a female DJ for the thatch-roofed poolside cabana where beachgoers undulate, hips exuberantly swaying\u0026nbspto Egyptian singer Sherine Abdel Wahab and Lebanese singer Maya Yazbek.Lebanon, where people from different sects share offices, neighbourhoods and businesses, and crop tops can outnumber hijabs in some Beirut neighbourhoods, might seem like a natural inventor of the ladies’ beach. But women-only hours at the pool or the beach are common in other parts of the Middle East, too, including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, where dress codes for local women are more uniformly conservative.At the Bellevue, there are\u0026nbspno religious strictures on swim attire but each woman’s own.Nada’s 21-year-old daughter wears modest gym clothing when she goes to mixed beaches with her husband at the Bellevue, she wore a bikini top with a short swim skirt.

But she had resolved to keep her three young daughters unveiled until they, too, were 23.“Religion is broad,” she says. “It’s a personal choice.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/25/08/rtr23363.jpg","title":"next online sales brexit border delays exchange rates retail","story":"Created with Sketch.High street chain has hedged exposure to exchange rate volatility for next two yearsClick to followThe IndependentNext expects less than half of sales to come from retail stores this yearRetailer Next has set out its plans for a no-deal Brexit and said the biggest risk to its business over the next few years is the potential for long delays at UK and EU ports. The high street store called on the government to provide more clarity about its planning, in order to enable it to make suitable arrangements. The company said the “indirect risk of interruption to the smooth operation of our ports represents the biggest risk to our business from Brexit”. According to Next, there is “no reason why goods should not flow with relatively little friction through customs from the EU”, but “the issue will be the preparedness of the UK authorities and UK businesses”.Another risk the company is facing is volatility in the pound. In a bid to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations, Next has secured exchange rates in US dollars, its most important trading currency, for the next two years. In 2018, the costing rate is $1.29 per £1, and in 2019 the company expects to get $1.33 per £1. In early trading on Tuesday, the pound was at $1.31. Next said its decision to hedge exposure to the pound means it is not expecting any cost price inflation over the next 18 months.

mcdonnell","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followIndy PoliticsLabour confirms Remain can be party\u0027s choice in new Brexit referendum after split between top figuresLabour is embroiled in a row over the party’s approach to a Final Say Brexit referendum, following a split between two of the shadow cabinet’s most senior figures.Sir Keir Starmer, the party’s Brexit spokesman,\u0026nbspwas forced to confirm that remaining in the EU will be a potential option in a future referendum backed by Labour\u0026nbspafter\u0026nbspJohn McDonnell, the shadow chancellor,\u0026nbspruled the idea out.Amid a backlash Mr McDonnell rowed back on his comments, and later conceded at a meeting at the party’s conference in Liverpool that Labour could still back a new vote that would see the party stay in the EU.It comes as Sir Keir will tell Labour conference on Tuesday that the party is set to oppose the deal Theresa May brings back from Brussels, having determined that it cannot meet his “six tests”.Another shadow cabinet minister, Barry Gardiner, also broke ranks to say that the idea the party will be able to secure a general\u0026nbspelection if Ms May’s plans fall apart was “looney tunes territory”.If the prime minister’s Brexit plans are rejected by parliament, and no election is forthcoming, then Labour’s new policy – arduously negotiated by Mr Starmer this week and to be approved on Tuesday – would see the party committed to a new Brexit referendum.It follows The Independent’s\u0026nbspFinal Say campaign for a people’s vote on the outcome of Brexit, which has been backed by more than 820,000 people in a petition.Mr McDonnell’s U-turn came at a fringe meeting where he was asked what options Labour would allow on the ballot paper, under its new policy on a further Brexit referendum.Flights grounded if UK leaves EU with no air deal, ministers admitAccepting Brexit is like happily paying for a meal you never receivedA final Brexit vote without Remain on the ballot would be nonsensicalCorbyn and McDonnell have forgotten they know nothing about BrexitMPs condemn Labour plan to deny option to Remain in fresh Brexit votePushed at the meeting as to whether he meant that Remain could be on the ballot paper in a referendum, Mr McDonnell commented: “That’s what he said.”Setting out his personal views, and underlining the future battles likely to be fought over the issue, he went on: “The issue there is, we’re saying respect the past referendum, and I just tell you, we have to be careful what we wish for here.”It marked a change in tone from an earlier interview he had given on Brexit in which he said that said Labour would “go for a people’s vote” on leaving the EU, but any referendum would not include an option to stay in the bloc.It came after an official Labour meeting agreed that on Tuesday the party would vote on whether to accept a policy stating that if the prime minister’s Brexit plans collapse, but the Tories refuse to call an election, “Labour must support all options remaining on the table including a public vote”.\u0026nbspEarlier in the day, Sir Keir had waded in to clear up the confusion caused by Mr McDonnell’s initial comments, telling The Independent: “The idea is to retain flexibility, the motion doesn’t rule out Remain, it doesn’t tie us to any position on what should be in any future vote.” \u0026nbspThe shadow cabinet minister, apparently reacting to anger in the wake of Mr McDonnell’s words, made similar comments to delegates at a fringe meeting on Monday.People’s vote supporters had condemned Mr McDonnell’s suggestion that a new referendum should exclude a Remain option as “farcical”.David Lammy, a supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “Labour members support a People’s Vote by almost nine to one – 90 per cent of Labour members want to stay in the EU.“They did not do this to be offered a farcical referendum on no deal or a bad deal. It absolutely must include the right to stay in the EU.”People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchOn Tuesday Sir Keir will tell conference Labour is preparing to vote against Theresa May’s Brexit deal, as new party analysis indicated her Chequers proposals cannot meet Labour’s six tests.He will also commit Labour to vote down a “blind Brexit”\u0026nbspthat risks the UK jumping “into the unknown” – an increasing danger amid claims that any withdrawal agreed by Ms May will necessarily have to be vague so that she can get her fractious backbenchers to vote for it.Sir Keir will say: “A Tory civil war that has gone on for years, now threatens our future prosperity. The party that once promised that it would fix the roof while the sun was shining is now intent on burning the whole house down.\u0026nbsp“So, I’ve got a message for the Prime Minister. ‘If your party wants to tear itself apart, that’s fine, but you’re not taking our country with you.’”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"labour conference live updates jeremy corbyn speech brexit mp theresa may conservatives latest news","story":"Created with Sketch.Follow for live updates from LiverpoolClick to followIndy PoliticsLabour \u0027likely\u0027 to vote against Theresa May\u0027s Brexit agreementBrexit: New referendum could include option to Remain under Labour plans, says Keir StarmerRow brewing over creation of female deputy leader positionInside the meeting that decided Labour\u0027s Brexit policyLabour conference - LIVE: MPs \u0027likely\u0027 to be ordered to vote down Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal, Keir Starmer saysLabour MPs\u0026nbspare likely to be\u0026nbspordered to vote down Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal in parliament,\u0026nbspSir Keir\u0026nbspStarmer\u0026nbsphas said ahead of a major conference speech.Delegates\u0026nbspwill hold a crunch vote\u0026nbspon the party\u0027s Brexit strategy today amid splits between the shadow cabinet\u0027s most\u0026nbspsenior figures over whether all options should remain on the table\u0026nbsp- including staying in the EU.Sir Keir,\u0026nbspthe shadow Brexit secretary, told The Independent\u0026nbspthat remaining in the EU could still be on the ballot paper in a Labour-backed referendum, just hours after John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, appeared to rule it out.See below for live updatesKeir Starmer gets a standing ovation from delegates at the end of his speech, where he\u0026nbspset out that Brexit has ided the country, and Labour is united in its response.\u0026nbspHe said he was \u0027devastated\u0027 by the referendum result as he had campaigned passionately to stay in the EU.\u0026nbspIn a key extract, he said: I know that you want clarity on where we stand on the deal now.\u0026nbspBecause some have said Labour could vote for any deal the Tories reach. Some have said we may abstain.\u0026nbspSome have said we may support a vague deal – a ‘blind Brexit’ – that gives no detail about the terms of our future relationship. So, let me be very clear - right here, right now:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf Theresa May brings back a deal that fails our tests – and that looks increasingly likely - Labour will vote against it. No ifs, no buts.\u0026nbspSir Keir Starmer declined to rule out extending the Article 50 process, under which the UK leaves the EU two years after declaring its intention to quit.Asked whether he could guarantee Britain would leave the EU on March 29, Sir Keir told TalkRadio: Well the answer is it depends, because we don\u0027t know when we\u0027re going to get a deal.The October deadline might slip to November, November might slip to December. I don\u0027t know, I\u0027m not conducting the negotiations so the timeline is not in our control.I don\u0027t think at this stage anybody is talking about extending Article 50 but if it has to be extended quite frankly it will be because of the collapsing failure of the discussions and the negotiations.Sir Keir will give his main conference speech later this morning, where he will announce that Labour is preparing to vote against Theresa May\u0027s deal if it doesn\u0027t meet its six tests.\u0026nbspAsked about the plan by Today, he said: I think it\u0027s going to be a very bad deal, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s going to meet our tests and we shouldn\u0027t be voting for a deal which we don\u0027t think is in the national interest.He added: We cannot carry on with this idea that the prime minister can bring back any deal that she cobbles together and we must all vote for it however awful it is, because something even worse will happen if we don\u0027t. What is the point? That\u0027s not a meaningful vote.To say to parliamentarians \u0027Well, you can have a vote on this deal, but, by the way, if you don\u0027t vote for it, you\u0027re going to get something much worse\u0027, and there has to be a point where Parliament says it is not good enough.I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a majority in Parliament for no deal, I don\u0027t think no deal is the consequence, that\u0027s why we\u0027re putting other options on the table.Sir Keir Starmer insisted that\u0026nbspLabour\u0026nbspis coming together over its Brexit approach, as splits over strategy dominated the party\u0027s annual conference.\u0026nbspHe told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: We\u0027ve got a proposition, it\u0027s going to be put to a vote today, there\u0027s going to be unity behind that.\u0026nbspSir Keir also appeared to suggest John McDonnell might have been tired yesterday when he ruled out keeping staying in the EU on the table.\u0026nbspThe shadow Brexit secretary said: To be fair, John (McDonnell) did a number of interviews yesterday and I think you know that he did say later in the day that all options are on the table, so just trying to sort of find this ide between a party which is actually coming together today around a proposition is fine and I understand it.Welcome to The Independent\u0027s politics liveblog, where we will be bringing you all the latest updates from Labour\u0027s annual conference in Liverpool.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/10/07/08/Channel-Tunnel-EPA.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/10/07/08/Channel-Tunnel-EPA.jpg","title":"no deal brexit uk britain eu flights plane green card latest final say pet passport","story":"Created with Sketch.Pet owners who want to take their dogs and cats abroad are warned they would have to register three months in advanceClick to followIndy PoliticsThe threat to flights was attacked as \u0027a bureaucratic nightmare and a farce\u0027Brexit: Flights to be grounded if Britain crashes out of EU with no emergency air deal, government admitsFlights will be grounded if Britain crashes out of the EU next March unless an emergency aviation deal can be struck, the government has admitted.The latest batch of advice papers also warned food producers that pre-packaged products “would no longer be valid for the EU market”, without a separate EU business address.Ministers also told motorists that they would need to apply for a green card as proof of third party motor insurance cover when driving in the EU.And pet owners who want to take their dogs and cats abroad would face the significant inconvenience of having to register three months in advance.Meanwhile, UK hauliers were warned they could be banned from the continent, because they could “no longer rely on automatic recognition by the EU of UK-issued community licences”.The Food and Drink Federation reacted with horror to the technical notices, warning they “lay bare the grisly prospect of a no-deal Brexit”.It urged Theresa May to stop “lecturing the EU” and seek to delay Brexit, by extending the Article 50 deadline, if it could not secure a withdrawal deal “imminently”.Layla Moran, a Liberal Democrat supporter of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain, said the threat to flights was “a bureaucratic nightmare and a farce”.Tories at war: Boris Johnson \u0027suicide vest\u0027 Brexit jibe causes ideInternal isions in the Conservative Party have exploded into a bitter public row over Boris Johnson‘s “disgusting” criticism of Theresa May.Sajid Javid, the home secretary, rebuked his former cabinet colleague and said: “I think there are much better ways to articulate your differences.”But other MPs leapt to Mr Johnson’s defence, as iding lines ahead of a possible leadership contest begin to take shape.

Does anybody seriously think the Spanish government, which would see hotel bookings collapse in 2019, is going to intervene to stop planes flying? Of course, they’re not.”But the new guidance admits airlines “would lose the automatic right to operate air services between the UK and the EU without seeking advance permission”.The inside story of the meeting that decided Labour\u0027s Brexit policyMPs condemn Labour plan to deny option to Remain in fresh Brexit voteTory Brexiteers are peddling another fantasy with Canada deal ideaA no-deal Brexit could also force passengers to re-screen luggage and go back through security on, for example, a flight to the UK via Paris or Amsterdam.The department for transport said its “preference” would be to agree “a basic arrangement or understanding” with the EU –\u0026nbsparguing Brussels had already said that would be desirable.Alternatively, it suggested “bilateral arrangements between the UK and an inidual EU country could be put in place, specifying the conditions under which air services would be permitted”.Under the pet passports scheme, which involves a rabies vaccination and a microchip, people can take their dogs, cats or ferrets to the EU and back again without quarantine.The technical notice said the UK is pressing to become a “listed” third country after Brexit, to avoid “burdensome” new requirements.But it admitted that designation as an “unlisted” third country would leave\u0026nbsppet-owners having to discuss travelling with their animals to EU countries with an “official veterinarian” months in advance.UK coach operators were advised to consider subcontracting “all or part” of travel on the continent to EU-based operators, because their licences might not be recognised.Jenny Chapman, Labour’s shadow Brexit minister, said: “Today\u0027s Brexit notices underline why no-deal is simply not an option.“The British people will be very alarmed to find out that UK and EU licensed airlines would need to seek new permissions to be able to operate in the event of no-deal.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/21/14/venezuela-passport-office.jpg","title":"venezuela passport leave economy maduro colombia border immigration","story":"Created with Sketch.UN says 2.3 million people have left the country since 2015, but those without a passport are unable to escapeClick to followThe Independent USPeople wait in line outside Saime offices in Caracas  After a year struggling to make ends meet under Venezuela’s crushing hyperinflation, Jennyfer and her boyfriend decided to flee the country.

He has been awarded a full scholarship to study performing arts, but if he doesn’t arrive in time it will be taken away.Without answers about the status of his application, which he has been processing since 2016, he’s starting to feel desperate.“I’ve thought about leaving without a passport, I can’t waste more time,” he says.AFPGetty Images)The passport system began to fail two years ago. In theory, the process is easy. It’s done through a web page in which the citizen requests an appointment, attends the appointment and is given the passport within a couple of weeks. But often, users say, the website crashes and the appointment gets cancelled or people’s data just disappears from the system.“It’s as if I had never attended the appointment,” says Delia Cabral, 52, whose data disappeared from the website after she went to her meeting.The accountant has been waiting since May for her passport. Her daughter is waiting for her in Spain.It’s as if I had never attended the appointment\u0026nbspExperts say that Caracas’s telecommunication infrastructure is one of the weakest in the region, so it is not surprising that high-traffic websites collapse.In July, a new head of Saime was named. He promised a complete renovation of the website, as well as a profound restructuring of the organisation. However, the system still seems to be failing.The passport agency has blamed shortages of materials, like paper and plastic, for the delays.Venezuela has been suffering from shortages of food, medicines and other basic goods for many years now. The lack of passports is just one of them.The legal price of a passport in Venezuela is 18 bolivars, or $0.30 (£0.23) at the black market exchange rate. However, tired of waiting, some Venezuelans choose to pay for the service of officials who can speed up the process for $1,000, at the very least. A prohibitively expensive amount for most Venezuelans,given the monthly minimum wage is $18.Maduro urges Venezuelan migrants to return home from ‘economic slavery’ in other countriesThis is an illegal practice for which several Saime officials have been arrested in recent months. The institution also blames those members of the “mafia”\u0026nbspinside the passport agency for the delays.The economic and social crisis has become so unbearable that hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans consider escaping the country to be their only option – a feeling that has only increased over the past few months.President Nicolas Maduro denies the existence of a migration crisis and blames his critics for inflating the numbers.The government typically does not publish data, but the UN estimates that 2.3 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015, especially to neighbouring countries like Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. In August, the UN warned the migration exodus was reaching a “crisis moment”,\u0026nbspakin to the situation in Mediterranean.\u0026nbspLast month, Ecuador and Peru tightened their migration controls for Venezuelans, requiring them to show valid passports at the border. That decision left many Venezuelans who had been travelling without passports in limbo.The measure was later overturned. Over recent weeks, 11 Latin American countries agreed to allow Venezuelans to enter their countries even if their passports have expired.While this is a relief for those who haven’t been able to renew their travel documents, nothing changes for those who have never had a passport, like Jennyfer.“It makes no difference for me,” she says “I’m still stuck in here.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/1022385_1.jpg","title":"Labour conference 2018 latest news live brexit keir starmer jeremy corbyn john mcdonnell","story":"Labour will hold a Brexit debate later today as the party remains confused and ided over its stance.John McDonnell previously dismissed holding a second referendum as he claims it will \u0026ldquoide the country again.But Keir Starmer has not ruled out the option of remaining in the EU.The party will debate and vote on a motion to remain in the bloc on the table if a General Election cannot be triggered by Labour.The final draft for the vote says: If we cannot get a general election, Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote.

Heres the latest.While a number of politicians and celebrities have added their voice to growing calls for a second referendum this has always been rejected by Downing Street.In September 2018 the mayor of Manchester Andy Burnham backed a second Brexit vote  there was a no-deal scenario - but warned it could trigger social unrest.Theresa Mays official spokesman has said: The British people have voted to leave the EU and there is not going to be a second referendum under any circumstances.It could depend on how Brits perceive Parliamentary squabbles over Mrs Mays Chequers deal.Theresa May called on Jeremy Corbyn to rule out a second vote on EU membership during PMQs, but the Labour leader failed to respond.Labour has been in a muddle over the issue too — with the leadership refusing to commit to a call for a second vote despite cries from centrist MPs and members.A sizeable section in the party want a second referendum and pressure is mounting on the left-wing leader.The GMB, one of the UKs biggest trade unions, called for a vote on the final Brexit deal.Later in September 2018, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan dramatically called for another EU referendum — saying that people must be given the opportunity to reject Brexit.The Mayor of London, who is an avowed remainer, argued Britain is facing either a bad deal or “no deal” which he says will hit jobs and living standards.Referring to the worst case scenerios, Mr Khan said: “They are both incredibly risky and I don’t believe Theresa May has the mandate to gamble so flagrantly with the British economy and people’s livelihoods.” Party bosses have hinted theyll back a second referendum - but Jeremy Corbyns closest ally, John McDonnell, has ruled out keeping Britain in the EU.Labour bigwigs set out a new policy which could see the party supporting a fresh referendum  Theresa May refuses to call a General Election.But the policy was blown apart just hours later when Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell suggested the second referendum wouldnt include an option to remain in the EU.Speaking on the BBC’s Today programme, the hard-left veteran said: “We’ve said we want a people’s vote  we can’t get a General Election.“We accept the last referendum - we want a General Election,  we can’t get that we want some form of democratic option.”Asked what form a second referendum would take, Mr McDonnell said: “It will be on the deal itself. We will respect the referendum.”Speaking to ITVs Good Morning Britain, he added: It will be about whether you accept the deal or not or whether you send people back to negotiate a proper deal.And he told BBC Radio 5 Live: My big worry is that  we go for a referendum which is seen as just a simple re-run we could ide the country again, we could get almost the same result or  its slightly dferent that people demand another referendum.Following John McDonnells comments, Labours Shadow Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Keir Starmer reaffirmed that the party have not ruled out calling for a second Brexit referendum.Ahead of a vote at the party conference on Tuesday September 25, the shadow Brexit secretary said that a motion on the highly isive question that has dominated the event in Liverpool doesnt rule out Remain.He told the Independent: The idea is to retain flexibility, the motion doesnt rule out Remain, it doesnt tie us to any position on what should be in any future vote.It was reported that he is due to tell the party conference in Liverpool: The party that once promised to fix the roof while the sun was shining now seems intent on burning the whole house down.Just when we need a strong government, what do we see from the Tories? Division, chaos and failure.No credible plan for Brexit. No solution to prevent a hard border in Ireland. And no majority in Parliament for the Chequers proposals.A Tory civil war that has gone on for years now threatens our future prosperity.Its reported he will add: If your party wants to tear itself apart, thats fine, but youre not taking our country with you.Setting out Labours approach to the upcoming Commons vote, Sir Keir said: If Theresa May brings back a deal that fails our tests - and that looks increasingly likely - Labour will vote against it. No s, no buts.And  the Prime Minister thinks well wave through a vague deal asking us to jump blindfolded into the unknown, she can think again.You cant meet Labours tests by failing to provide answers. We will vote down a blind Brexit.Let me be clear: this isnt about frustrating the process. Its about stopping a destructive Tory Brexit. Its about fighting for our values. And about fighting for our country.According to Oddschecker, BetFred have offered offs of 9/4 for a second referendum on leaving the EU.A poll carried out by NatCen and The UK in Changing Europe revealed 59 percent of voters would now vote to remain in the EU, while 41 percent would opt to leave.The author of the poll John Curtice urged caution over the finding.He said the interview panel was skewed towards remain, and that some of the sht was among those who did not take part in the original Brexit referendum.The first referendum on EU membership took place in 1975.Two-thirds of voters  backed the continued membership of the European Economic Community, which the UK had joined only two years before. Under Harold Wilsons leadership, the Labour Party was trying to present to the public a dferent version of EEC membership to get a better deal.The EEC was integrated into the European Union after it was created in 1993.In the summer of 2016, Britain voted to leave the EU after 17.4million people backed Leave compared to 16.1million Remain voters.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last year he came to Britain to meet leading figures in GI, and he held a training day where he taught activists about campaign strategies.In Austria, there are signs that this strategy is working. Last year, the far-right Freedom Party recently won enough votes to join a coalition government, and GI has grown into a sizeable movement there.This helps to explain why the British government is so concerned about Sellner that they wouldnt let him in the country when he arrived earlier this year.Sellner insists that he is against violence and racism, but his group has become notorious for stunts targeted at asylum seekers making their way to Europe.With the aim of stopping more immigrants from reaching the continent, GI supporters crowdfunded over £150,000 last year as part of a movement called Defend Europe.The plan was to follow charity rescue vessels using a chartered boat and sink them  they tried to pick up any migrants trying to cross the ocean.GI activists - who are mostly white Europeans in their late 20s or early 30s - also planned to arrest any illegal immigrants they came across during a ten-day voyage off the coast of Libya.However, the stunt was a failure and, in an unlikely twist of fate, the Defend Europe boat was itself detained when authorities accused it of harbouring illegal immigrants.The mission was called off and the captain was arrested, although he was later released without charge.A few months later, the group paid for a red helicopter to land on the French Alps and display an enormous poster telling migrants to go home.The stunt cost £50,000, and was reported on by Vlogger Brittany, while he coordinated the mission from the air. Again, this statement was crowdfunded by thousands of GI supporters chipping in a few pounds each.Sellner was also behind the storming of Vienna Universitys theatre in April 2016, when members of GI rushed the stage during the performance of a play by asylum-seekers from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.The GI intruders unfurled a banner calling the audience hypocrites and slung fake blood into the crowd, supposedly to represent the blood of the people killed in the Paris terror attacks the previous year.As the performers panicked and ducked for cover, a brawl erupted between some GI activists and audience members shouting Nazis out.This event was one of Sellners first major campaigns, and it attracted the attention of the Austrian authorities.The birthplace of Adolf Hitler, Austria today maintains some of the worlds toughest rules against far-right groups and symbols.It didnt take long before Generation Identity found itself being charged by the government with being a criminal group, although GI insists that it is just a political organisation like any other.Sellner uses his stunts to get likes and shares on social media, where he and Pettibone count hundreds of thousands of followers.Pettibone - who has been described as an alt-right Barbie - has 140,000 followers on Twitter and 100,000 subscribers on YouTube, where she shares videos about her fiances political campaigns and her own wild conspiracy theories.But shes also a young adult author, and she peppers the controversial content on her YouTube account with the tame vlogs fitting of any millennial influencer, including one on why dating is so hard and a Q and A about her le.Sellner, however, isnt able to hide behind the same harmless hobbies.He grew up in an affluent suburb outside of Vienna and became interested in nationalist politics as a teenager.The BBC reports that he was a member of the neo-Nazi movement when he was younger, although he insists today that he was never a racist.Instead, he says he is just calling for immigrants to assimilate with the rest of society rather than isolating themselves in their own groups.He describes any failure to blend in as treason - because this community is taking you in and you have to put the interests of this community in front of your own.Natasha Strobl, an author and researcher, is one of the leading experts on the Identitarian movement Sellner represents.They paint refugees as invaders, as dangerous soldiers of Islam who come here to destroy Europe, she tells the BBC. It really destroys society.She fears her vocal criticism of Sellners movement has put her in danger, and shes been the victim of harassment from the far-right.There are rape and murder threats when you open your email, she says. I try not to go the same ways in the city because I dont want to be followed.People like Natasha fear that charismatic figures like Martin Sellner could end up shting European politics in the direction of the far-right.Austria has recently recently seen profound political changes of its own, with the nationalist, anti-immigration Freedom Party joining the countrys coalition government last year.Now, Sellner, who is viewed by many as the poster boy for the white nationalist Identitarian movement, is feared to be trying to expand GI across Europe.When he was last in Britain last year - before he was banned from entering the country - Sellner met with former EDL leader Tommy Robinson.Some have speculated that the pair could have been discussing the possibility of Robinson taking up the mantle of leading GI in the UK.Regardless of whether Sellner can bring his politics to Britain, its clear that his reach already extends far beyond Austria.Coupled with his vlogger girlfriend, he boasts an enormous platform, and it remains to be seen what stunts he intends to carry out next.One thing is clear, however... with the UK government worked up about the thought of him entering the country, theres definitely far more to Sellner than his hipster facade lets on.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The EU know this Government didn’t start properly planning for no deal until this summer.Senior figures there believe the UK will back down rather than go down a route it is so ill-prepared for.So Mrs May is trying to, publicly, burn her boats on the beach.To show that she can’t accept membership of the European Economic Area and the customs union, which would leave the UK as essentially a non-voting member of the EU, or the current Irish backstop, which would see Northern Ireland kept in the EU’s customs union even as the rest of the UK leaves it.One Downing Street source tells me all European leaders say they want an agreement.But a deal isn’t compatible with their Irish backstop proposal. So they’ll have to choose.If the EU doesn’t show any sign of moving in the next fortnight, Mrs May will come under real pressure to change tack from Chequers from her own Cabinet.“The problem is the Cabinet ministers who backed it on the grounds that it was doable,” one Secretary of State tells me. .A growing number of Cabinet ministers think that with the EU rejecting Chequers, Mrs May should turn to a more Canada-style approach — pushing for the free trade deal the EU has repeatedly said is on offer.“There’s an opportunity amid the embarrassment,” one member of this group tells me.No10 rejects this argument, saying a Canada-style deal doesn’t solve the Irish backstop problem.But these ministers think by moving away from Chequers, the UK could create the space for a compromise on the Irish border.Another problem is how blindsided No10 was by the Salzburg snub.This will make it harder for Downing Street to persuade ministers to trust its judgment on what compromises need to be made to get a deal.For instance, Olly Robbins, the PM’s chief Europe adviser, wants us to commit to matching EU social and environmental regulations as well as product regulations.This is meant to deal with one of the EU’s objections to Chequers, that the UK could gain a competitive advantage by not following every new EU rule in these fields.But several key ministers have objections to this.They are now less likely to accept this compromise because they are far more sceptical of Robbins’ reading of the state of the negotiations.In the coming weeks, the Cabinet will become more and more assertive.They won’t all be pushing for the same thing — there are those who would prefer a customs union to a Canada-style deal — but they will demand greater input.For they nearly all worry about no deal.One Government source tells me: “We all know what no deal looks like, you can’t blunder into that.”What Mrs May must do in the coming weeks is give herself room for manoeuvre between no deal and signing up to a customs union.She is trying to do that by shocking the EU into engaging with Chequers.But  the EU won’t, then several key Cabinet ministers will push for a new approach ahead of the October EU Council.THERESA MAY has set up a small, kitchen Cabinet to consult on Brexit policy.It met in the first week of September and again on Tuesday this week.This new Cabinet grouping essentially replaces the Brexit inner Cabinet.Mrs May cooled on this Brexit inner Cabinet, which was designed to be balanced between those who campaigned for Brexit and those who had backed Remain, after it objected to her preferred customs plan.I understand that Philip Hammond forcibly made the point that such a balanced committee constrained her options.Those attending this meeting include the increasingly influential David Lidington, Chancellor Philip Hammond, the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, the chief whip Julian Smith and the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, who has taken charge of the mission of selling Chequers.In Whitehall, this new group has been dubbed “The Chequers Defence Committee” because of how much of its time is taken up with working out how to sell the Prime Minister’s Brexit proposals.The first meeting included a discussion of whether, and how, ministers should respond to Boris Johnson’s broadsides against Mrs May’s plan.The discussions have also revealed something about Mrs May’s relationship with her own MPs.It was agreed that the PM would meet with a series of Labour Brexiteers – Gisela Stuart, Frank Field and Kate Hoey – in the hope that they might be able to persuade some of her MPs to back her approach.This is quite extraordinary: A PM trying to get opposition figures to persuade her own party to back her plans.CABINET will meet on Monday to discuss Britain’s post-Brexit immigration policy.This is one of the most important decisions this Government will take.So it is absurd that, on Friday lunchtime, ministers still did not have the papers for the meeting.I understand, though, that the Government’s intention is to come up with a system that does not discriminate between EU nationals and those from the rest of the world.However, the UK will be prepared to discuss immigration as part of a trade deal. But this arrangement will not be free movement.Earlier this month, Mrs May told her closest Cabinet colleagues that this is one of the issues she is determined not to compromise on.What is required is an immigration system that encourages the best and the brightest to come here and ensures this country has the workers it needs.I UNDERSTAND there was a plan for Jeremy Corbyn to attend today’s Liverpool match against Southampton ahead of Labour’s conference in the city.But the club didn’t want him on the pitch, so Corbyn won’t get to score at the Kop end.Labour deny that there was any plan for Corbyn to go on to the pitch.IF No10 didn’t have enough to worry about ahead of Tory conference, there is the issue of Theresa May’s voice.She can ill afford a repeat of last year, when it kept giving out during the speech.In an attempt to prevent this from happening, her schedule will be pared right back. Mrs May will do some events designed to encourage more women into politics.But Cabinet Ministers will fill in for her at the ious regional receptions to try to save her voice.Mrs May’s voice isn’t No10’s only concern.One Cabinet minister tells me: “They are completely paranoid she is going to get slow hand-clapped.”This fear strikes me as misplaced.Activists who remember the agony of last year’s conference speech will give her credit for standing up and doing it all over again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On Thursday they proved it, with their squalid ambush and the infantile taunting online.Mrs May has always treated EU leaders with respect. But these bullying egomaniacs, these swaggering posers in designer suits, lack the common decency to respect Britain, our Prime Minister and our democratic choice.So yesterday, on behalf of her position and the nation, she bit back. It was the best speech of her le. And her ­arguments were as unassailable as her welcome new tone was hostile.We CANNOT remain part of the EU’s institutions — and make a mockery of the referendum verdict. We WILL NOT split the UK. We WILL NOT annul the Brexit vote because they don’t like it.We CANNOT keep making sacrices and proposing solutions only for Brussels to reject them without any sensible counter offer. That’s not a negotiation.So, as Mrs May says, it’s stalemate. If, as The Sun expects, their response is more of the same, she should tell them this: “Here’s one final offer... not Chequers, but a simple free trade deal, plus security co-operation, that respects our referendum and your principles.“And since Michel Barnier now accepts that technology CAN police borders, let’s use it between Northern Ireland and Ireland.” If they spurn that, we’ll know they aren’t serious.We can leave with no deal, bank our £39billion orce payment and mitigate short-term damage by slashing taxes.We will lure businesses and talent from the continent and embrace those already here, as Mrs May has promised.And we will be free from the clutches of the Brussels club and the posturing pygmies running it.IS anyone more delusional or dishonest than the laughably-named People’s Vote campaign?These Remainiac losers pretend a second referendum is in the nation’s interests when it plainly only serves theirs.To get their way they would risk hideous disorder and the annihilation of trust in democracy. And they are utterly deluded about their chances of victory.Almost all Leavers would vote the same way, alongside many ex-Remainers who know the first vote must be honoured and now see the EU for what it truly is, especially after Thursday.But even  Remain won, why should anyone respect THEIR victory?It would never be sustainable. The fury at an EU which bullied us into a rerun would never subside. Nor would the rage at Remain diehards who ­colluded with Brussels to bring it about.The genie is out of the bottle.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Gone,  was the mantra that there is no alternative to the Chequers proposal, which so angered all of us who have campaigned for Brexit.Yet instead, two things emerged. The first that the Prime Minister was clearly angered by their treatment of her.Regardless of their views on Chequers, she has the right to believe that as the UK has always treated the EU with respect, so EU leaders should show the UK the same respect in .Second is what I and others have been saying, that the best and most workable relationship after we leave is one based on a comprehensive free trade agreement between the UK and the EU.However,  we are to reach such an agreement, the EU must recognise that they will have to get rid of the demands for a Northern Irish border backstop, which blocks such a deal.The EU demand that either the UK as a whole stay in the Customs Union or that Northern Ireland is separated from the UK by a customs border is unacceptable and would harm our Union.In fact, a recent publication by two ex-Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland shows that there does not need to be a “hard” border with checkpoints or gates, and instead we could have a practical solution where goods flow freely between Ireland and Northern Ireland.In fact, such a system should be employed at all our borders around the UK, as this would greatly reduce the likelihood of customs problems at ports from Zeebrugge to Calais.So after months of manoeuvring, and poor advice from advisers in No10, now the choice is at least — and at last — crystal clear.The UK wants a comprehensive trade deal with the EU but they need to cease demands about the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Failing that, the UK will leave under terms which govern trade between nations around the world.No trade deal is better than a bad trade deal, so the ball is firmly in the EU’s court.By Priti Patel, Tory former Cabinet ministerOUTRAGEOUS, insulting and immature sums up the EU’s appalling behaviour to the UK and to our Prime Minister.These shenanigans from an out-of-touch EU elite serve to demonstrate why Britain was right to vote leave.Who wants to remain in a club where its senior unelected figures mock our great and proud country and shamefully ambush our PM?Not only has Britain bankrolled the EU for the past 45 years, the freedoms and liberties enjoyed by the Continent have been secured by our Armed Forces and the sacrices Britain made in two world wars.While we want to maintain strong, friendly and cordial relations with our friends and partners in Europe, Donald Tusk belittles the PM on social media and President Macron brands those who back Brexit as “liars”.Macron’s undiplomatic comments are an insult not only to the 17.4million people who backed Brexit but to the entire country.Their aim is simple. To reverse the result of the referendum and put Brussels back in charge.The British people deserve better than the EU humiliating and insulting us.We are a proud nation and will not stand for a Government that surrenders to unreasonable demands from Europe’s unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats. This Government has already gone too far, with Chequers offering the EU control over large parts of our law-making.The sad fact about the position the Government is now in is that it was advised to “chuck Chequers” and pursue an alternative course of free and open trade.However, this is not the moment to cower and compromise further.Salzburg should mark the moment when we decide as a country to press ahead with taking back full control over our destiny.Our generous overtures of a £40billion orce payment, remaining an EU rule taker and compromise have been spurned and the EU is resorting to insults.So it’s time the Government realised this and “got real” on Brexit.Britain must take back control of these negotiations and send the EU a signal it will understand loud and clear.We must take the £40billion off the table and remind the EU there are serious consequences to their appalling behaviour and this will hit them hard.If they want to negotiate then we should offer them a take-it-or-leave-it, Canada-plus-style free trade deal, which is an economic prize for the UK and our trading partners.We leave the EU in six months and instead of wasting time accommodating its belligerent attitude, now is the time to unite the nation, believe in Britain and let the EU know that Brexit really does mean Brexit. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She quoted their slogan: “Better to break the law than break the poor.”The council eventually sent redundancy notices to its entire workforce and was denounced by former Labour leader Neil Kinnock.What will it take for Labour moderates to realise that they cannot possibly campaign for these Marxist clowns to be in Downing Street? Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was behaving normally and didnt seemed intoxicated at all.He added: Tom had phoned his mum and then his new flatmate to tell him he was two minutes away from home before he disappeared.Nobody can quite understand how its happened.He was quite close to getting home safe and had told people he was fine right up until the point he went missing.It has also been revealed Tom sent pals a picture on Snapchat moments before vanishing.Harley, 18, said: He was seen  in the nightclub but we dont know  he was alone or not.We know he went to McDonalds afterwards for from food and then he walked home.He sent the Snapchat image and then called his flatmates later to say he was two minutes from home.The last known image is the Snapchat post. We dont know who the two people arrested on suspicion of murder are.  We are all devastated and praying for good news.We are all trying to stick together both physically and mentally. No-one can understand whats happened.Two men, both aged 20, arrested in connection with the police investigation into his disappearance have now been released and face no further action.Tom, who is originally from Bromsgrove, had arrived in Worcester last weekend.His parents are desperately urging anyone who saw him between 3.30am and 4.30am on Wednesday to contact police.Dad Ian said: We last spoke to Tom on the phone at just after 3am, he told us he was already back home and was safe.My we, Vicki, then text him at 8.45am as we knew he had lectures and we wanted to check in with him.But we didn’t get a response and as hours passed we started to worry as he wasn’t answering our calls or texts.We are all so worried, it has been the most distressing two days of our lives and it’s completely out of character for Tom.He’s a lovely lad, happy go lucky and loves playing football, we just want him back home. If anyone knows anything about where he is please get in touch. Any information is useful.Worcester University has laid on counselling for students in the wake of Toms disappearance.Free taxis are also being laid on so students can get back to their digs safely from nights out in the city centre.Fresher Lauren Brown, 18, said: The university has been great.Its the last thing you want during your first days at uni but they have been good.The support is there for us  we need it. Everyone is just really concerned.Sammy Taylor, 18, was at the Velvet nightclub at the same time as Tom.She told how there was barely room to move inside the club as freshers converged on Tuesday night.The student added: I was out that night. It was rammed in there, there was a queue out of the door and down the street.Its hard to believe someone could go for a night out and not come home. Tom has been described as white, 5ft 5ins, slim, with short mousy brown hair and greyish green coloured eyes.He was wearing pale coloured jeans, a navy blue woolen zip-up Lacoste top, and green shoes at the time of his disappearance.Det Insp James Bayliss from West Mercia Police said: The investigation into the disappearance of Thomas remains a priority and we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding Thomass disappearance.This remains a missing person enquiry.I would like to thank the public of Worcester for their support and concern, the community response has been exceptional.We continue to actively search the area and I would reiterate that anyone with any information should contact the police as soon as possible.Anyone with any information is asked to call West Mercia Police on 101 quoting incident number 431s of 19 September."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004363109061.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jezza may snap election brexit","story":"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is so desperate for a fresh election he will swallow his lelong hatred of the EU and support a second referendum.And Tory PM Theresa May would rather call a snap ­election than have another Brexit poll.So, despite Downing Street denials, it looks as  we are lurching towards a showdown which risks 1,000 years of British democracy.For be in no doubt, a Corbyn election victory and a Marxist-led Momentum regime would fundamentally change our way of le, our economy and the social fabric of this nation.Even a coalition with other parties would hand Momentum anarchists control over crucial levers of power.This week’s Labour conference in Liverpool is a Jezza rally, with far-left cheerleaders clamouring to bring down the Tories.Almost 90 per cent want a second referendum. Until now, Jezza — a staunch Bennite eurosceptic — has resisted any move to overturn Brexit. Yesterday, in a remarkable U-turn, he vowed to accept whatever delegates say.So abject surrender to the mob is the price he will pay to destroy Theresa May. “I enjoy being leader,” he said yesterday. “I am carrying on as leader of the Labour Party because I want to win an election.”His persistence in the face of scathing personal ratings is the only glint of sunlight for stricken Tories.Under any other leader, even snooty wannabe Emily Thornberry, Labour would be miles ahead.But we have learned not to underestimate Corbyn.The People’s Vote movement probably has the numbers in Parliament to vote down any deal Mrs May brings back from Brussels.These so-called “moderates”, including the slippery Peter Mandelson, leadership flop David Miliband and decrepit Vince Cable, should be careful what they wish for.In normal times, the Tories would beat off the Momentum marauders. But for all her brave talk in Downing Street last week, Mrs May is a real political liability.She destroyed both her credibility and her majority in last year’s unforced contest.The public mood on Brexit is volatile and unpredictable.Most people believe the majority for Brexit, fuelled by EU arrogance and plain bad manners, could actually grow. But nobody’s sure.A snap election would focus the public’s attention on the choice between a clean break and a botched compromise which will never be acceptable to all sides.It could cauterise the issue which still ides families and friends. Or it could backfire badly.Tory Brexiteers must think hard before pulling the plug on the Maybot. It could split their party asunder.But so could Jeremy Corbyn’s rank opportunism.Blairite Labour moderates must soon choose.If they help Jeremy Corbyn win a vote of no confidence, what do they do next?Will they campaign for a party whose rampant extremists wish them dead? Will they stay silent while Momentum activists unseat their moderate comrades?Can deputy Tom Watson support a leader whose own MPs need round-the-clock armed guards against his dangerously fanatical supporters?Can they ignore threats of rape and torture? Nothing is too extreme or too petty for these thugs.

Deal, or no dough.LABOUR’S position on Brexit is clear as mud, but we know one thing they do believe: the Press needs muzzling.From the moment Jeremy Corbyn told us that “change is coming”, the media has come under attack after attack from a leader who is playing the man — not the ball — when it comes to those asking him legitimate questions.Union strongman Len McCluskey accused the media of “vicious attacks” on the Labour Party.But it’s not an “attack” to ask Corbyn, a man who wants to be PM, why he spent his holidays visiting a terrorists’ cemetery in Tunisia or why he invited the IRA for tea and treats in Parliament.Nor is it just the tactics of the hated “mainstream media” to ask John McDonnell whether his extremist economics will actually work in the real world..Today’s announcement on employee ownership appears appealing for workers, but it would only hit investment and productivity in the long-term.If this Labour Party gains power, the free Press — and the economy — would be in serious danger.IS Anthony Joshua now the UK’s most impressive sportsman?His win over Alexander Povetkin at a packed-out Wembley was stunning.It’s now on to Fury and Wilder.Beat those two, and he might go down as Britain’s best ever boxer.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Except, maybe, the rate at which jobs would be destroyed by Labour’s insane Marxist ­programme unleashed yesterday.At the very moment, post-Brexit, when we will need to maximise investment and cut costs for job-creating businesses, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell would declare war on them.His measures to interfere in, steal from or close private firms would be a bullet to the heart of the economy. What sane foreign business would come here or invest here? What sane firm, entrepreneur or inidual talent would stay?His pointless mass renationalisation programme would require debts dwarfing those we have spent nine years painfully reducing. The job-creating miracle since 2010 would be reversed.McDonnell no longer even pretends to be moderate. His is a deranged experiment on the world’s fth-biggest economy. A full-on hard-left revolution. Ask starving Venezuelans how they pan out.But the reason it cuts through is a lack of Tory ideas. McDonnell’s medicine is poison. So what’s Chancellor Philip Hammond’s remedy for our problems?Taxing your fizzy drink at McDonald’s.Mr McDonnell said: “Water bills have risen 40 per cent in real terms since privatisation.“Water companies receive more in tax credits than they pay in tax. Each day enough water to meet the needs of 20million people is lost due to leakages.“With figures like that, we can’t afford not to take them back.”In the small print published by Labour today, the party confirmed that all senior figures at the firms will be put out of a job.They said: “All staff will transfer in the same roles, except for senior executives and directors, whose posts will be re-advertised on dramatically reduced salaries capped by our 20:1 pay ratio policy.”In a chilling warning, Mr McDonnell said that under Labour, the full weight of the Treasury would be used to “take on any vested interests that try to thwart the will of the people”.Michael Roberts, the head of Water UK, said in response: “To replace managers who have decades of experience in running successful water companies, and put much needed investment at risk by handing the industry over to politicians, risks years of chaos in an essential public service.”Mr McDonnell used his speech to officially unveil plans to force all large companies to transfer a tenth of their shares into a fund controlled by employees.He said: We will legislate for large companies to transfer shares into an Inclusive Ownership Fund. The shares will be held and managed collectively by the workers.The shareholding will give workers the same rights as other shareholders to have a say over the direction of their company.And idend payments will be made directly to the workers from the fund. Payments could be up to £500 a year.Business groups have warned that the plan could devastate the economy by slashing the value of companies and discouraging them from investing in improved productivity.Adam Marshall of the British Chambers of Commerce said: Let no one be fooled, Labour’s proposals are both a tax grab and an unprecedented overreach into the way many of our businesses are run and will raise serious concerns.At a time of peak Brexit uncertainty, when Labour should be setting out how it will support business confidence and investment, it is announcing policies that would deliver the exact opposite.“The call for wholesale nationalisation could put investment in a deep freeze at precisely the time we want to be encouraging investment in the economy.Economists likened the vow to the Socialist policies of late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez.And Matt Kilcoyne of the Adam Smith Institute blasted: The Chavez-style commitment to readvertise jobs at utility firms taken back into state control will make the roles political and take people with years of experience and track records of success away from where theyre most needed.CBI head Carolyn Fairbairn said: “Take steps like this and investment will flee our country and the outcome will be one that reduces pay in people’s pockets.”Chancellor Philip Hammond said: “Labour’s plan to put politicians in charge of crucial industries means there would be nowhere to turn when things go wrong.Mr McDonnell opened his speech by suggesting that the anti-Semitism crisis which has gripped Labour in recent months is an attempt to smear Mr Corbyn.He said: They’ve attacked my friend and they’ve attacked him because he stands up for the ideals and beliefs that we all have.I just want to say Jeremy how proud I am of you for the courage and dignity you have shown."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0003707744081.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"otzi mystery tattoos deciphered","story":"Otzi, a frozen 5,300-year-old man, was found in 1991 in a glacier in the Alps between what is now Austria and Italy.Since the discovery, Otzi has been examined by multiple teams of scientists, with new chest tattoos among the more recent discoveries.Some now believe that he may have benefited from a form of prehistoric healthcare after they found tattoo markings they claim are actually acupuncture wounds on his remains.Scientists have previously organised these tattoos into 19 dferent groups, each of which form a set of horizontal or vertical lines.According to Discover Magazine, they cluster around joints and the lower back - where Otzi suffered from degeneration.However, researchers who put forth the acupuncture claim still do not know  the tattoos demarcated the areas for acupuncture treatment, or  they were the treatment itself.It also still remains a theory, as they have noted he had markings across his chest where he suffered no known ailments.Meanwhile, according to Albert Zink of the Institute for Mummy Research in Bolzano, new findings show that healthcare at the time of the iceman was surprisingly well developed.Bolzano scientists found that Otzi, who lived to 40 or 50 years of age, probably had some chronic health problems.A careful study of his remains showed that his teeth were carious, he suffered with stomach ulcers, his joints were worn out and his blood vessels were calcied.Zink claims that Otzi was treated for his medical conditions by prehistoric doctors.Researchers found traces of birch polypore fungi in Otzis belongings which have anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties.They also found bracken which was used to combat intestinal parasites.Upon a more careful study of Otzis body, Zink and his colleagues discovered that the icemans skin was actually covered with 61 tattoos.To make the tattoos, coal dust was rubbed into small wounds similar to the insertion of acupuncture needles, which according to Zink is a time-consuming and skillful endeavour.Earlier this year, experts found undisputed proof that Otzi died from an arrow injury."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436404052.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dan bilzerian parties poolside with tyga and models","story":"The 37-year-old was joined by topless Brazilian model and actress Suelyn Medeiros before going bull riding in the pool.Known as the King of Instagram, Dan was spotted shirtless as he had a bevy of beauties surrounding him.Tyga joined the soiree later in the afternoon and could not stop smiling.Mr Bilzerian hits the headlines for his lavish parties and his antics with scantily claid women.But another side was seen to him during the Las Vegas shooting last year, that killed as many as 59 people and injured more than 500.When warped killer Stephen Paddock, 64, opened fire on a music concert from his hotel window, Dan was in the city at the time.A video circulated of Mr Bilzerian running from the chaos after he allegedly witnessed a woman get shot in the head.Dakota Meyer, the husband of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin’s daughter Bristol, slammed Bilzerian for fleeing the scene.The decorated veteran, who served in Afghanistan as part of the US Marine Corps, wrote on Instagram: “This is why children shouldn’t classy heroes by their followers or their photos.“@danbilzerian this is what kills me about people like you.

The brain scores of people who did physical activity like swimming and running for 150 minutes a week performed better.Over time, the brain begins to shrink, causing memory failure and personality changes.Dementia is the leading cause of UK deaths and the only one in the top ten without a treatment to prevent, cure or slow it.Its cost to the nation is set to more than double to £55billion over the next 25 years as better treatment for other illnesses leads to longer lespans.A DAILY ten-minute walk may help ward off dementia, say experts.A Calornian study using MRI brain scans found that even mild exercise boosted the hippocampus, the area of the brain responsible for storing memories.“It’s one of the first regions to deteriorate as we get older — and much more severely in Alzheimer’s disease,” said research co-leader Prof Michael Yassa.It comes as a separate German study showed that 150 minutes of exercise a week can stave off the symptoms of Alzheimer’s.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So we will have to move on from Chequers  there is no movement from Barnier in two weeks.”Mrs May  left the Salzburg update to the very end of the  two-hour meeting, which had already overrun.One minister said: “We just wanted to get out by then.”During her pitch, Mrs May told them that “a critical point” was always going to come in the negotiations. But she implored: “Now is the time to hold our nerve”.The PM was backed by Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab straight after the meeting, who dubbed it “a good, healthy discussion”.He added: “The Prime Minister made clear we are going to keep our calm and press the EU on some of the criticisms  they have made. But also to be clear that there are no credible alternatives  the EU has come up with.”Over the weekend, Mr Raab joined Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt to cast doubt on the Chequers plan by suggesting there are alternatives.\" data-credit=\"\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-img=\"https:www.thesun/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/b5.jpg?strip=all\u0026ampw=817\" height=\"519\" width=\"817\"/4Over the weekend, Mr Raab joined Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt to cast doubt on the Chequers plan by suggesting there are alternativesSources close to Mr Hunt yesterday said he has “intellectual sympathy” with a Canada-style free trade deal.But No10 insists the Cabinet has always fully backed Chequers “and that continues to be the case”.Downing Street also made it clear that the PM was expecting the EU to come up with a solution to the deadlock by the next  summit on October 18.Her official spokesman said: “We are now waiting for the EU to evolve its position.”TWO thirds of Brexit voters just want to leave the EU and do not care how.A poll found 66 per cent who backed Leave are “not interested in the details and just want those responsible to get on with it”.The ORB poll of 2,000 found 82 per cent  are “fed up with some pro-Brexit and pro-Remain politicians claiming they speak for everyone who voted in the referendum”.The poll was commissioned by the Brexit Delivery Group, Tory backbenchers pushing for a softer Brexit.Leader Simon Hart said: “This shows voters are much more realistic and pragmatic than MPs. It’s time to put ideology to one side and listen.”But  pro-EU Tory MPs  stepped up their calls for an alternative Brexit plan at the same time as hardline Brexiteer Tories did.

Lower skilled workers will be granted entry in areas where there are serious labour market shortages that have not been able to be filled from the domestic market – such as in hospitality and construction.The Cabinet victory for Mr Javid was dubbed “a slam dunk” last night, after he won earlier support from the PM for it. Chancellor Philip Hammond made a plea for the Cabinet to give the new system more thought before they made a decision, but he was rebuffed.Business Secretary Greg Clark also insisted on the need to be flexible with Brussels during a long discussion yesterday afternoon.But a Cabinet source said: “There was a little bit of grumbling from the usual suspects, Philip and Greg, but they folded pretty quickly. It was a very well executed operation by Sajid, as he had all the facts on his side.”Mr Javid’s plan was boosted by a presentation to Cabinet yesterday by the chair of the independent Migration Advisory Committee, Professor Alan Manning. The LSE professor repeated his findings from a landmark, year-long report last week that there was little need for low skilled immigration to the UK.Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey was also said to have taken a dig at Mr Hammond during the No10 meeting.The Sun was told that passionate Brexiteer Ms McVey said to the table: “We’re told by some people that we’re going to have a recession when we leave, and at the same time that we need mass immigration to keep the economy afloat. They can’t both be correct”.Downing Street is keeping the Cabinet’s formal conclusions under wraps so that she can unveil them in her speech to Tory conference next week.But in a strong hint at what we decided, a No10 spokesman said last night: “Cabinet today received a presentation from Migration Advisory Committee chairman Professor Alan Manning.“Cabinet was told by Professor Manning that the MAC was recommending that, in the post-Brexit immigration system, EEA and non-EEA nationals should be part of one universal system.“A key conclusion was that high skilled migration is of greater economic benefit than lower skilled migration, and as such the MAC recommended that the new system should make it easier for higher skilled than lower skilled workers to come to the UK.“The Cabinet agreed that, once free movement is brought to an end, the Government will be able to introduce a new system which works in the best interests of the United Kingdom – including by helping to boost productivity.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He also claimed the EU had already offered this more basic approach to a new trade deal.Speaking at the alternative plan’s launch, Mr Rees-Mogg said: “So much of what we hear about these negotiations has been about managing decline, has been about how you have the least bad Brexit, this is about how you can have a fantastic Brexit that sets us up for the next generation and ensures our prosperity.“This has been offered to us by the Commission, they have offered us the best trade deal they have ever done with any country ever in the world, so  you want to call it Canada plus, or super Canada or supercalragilisticexpialidocious Canada, that is what is being aimed and its being offered.”But the plan was overshadowed by a row over why Boris Johnson didn’t turn up at the launch. He was said to have changed his mind at the last minute.Instead he tweeted his support of the alternative plan with another dig at Mrs May.Referring to her speech on Friday calling for the EU to show Britain “respect,” Mr Johnson said of the IEA report: “This is a plan the EU would understand and respect - delivering prosperity for the UK and our European partners. I’ve no doubt it would unite MPs and the country.”But yesterday No10 poured scorn on the plans.The Prime Minister’s spokesman said: “In relation to ‘Canada plus’, no EU third country free trade agreement has ever led to a reduction in barriers to the extent that no hard border is needed, and there is no global precedent for an infrastructure-free border without substantial regulatory and customs alignment.”Referring to the EU free trade agreement  with Canada, known as CETA, Mrs May’s spokesman said: “CETA still requires third country customs controls, rules of origin requirements, risk and intelligence-led border checks.“Given a standard free trade agreement could not prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, the EU’s position is that their proposed Northern Ireland protocol would come into effect.“So, the FTA would only apply to the Great Britain-EU relationship, with Northern Ireland effectively remaining in parts of the single market and customs union.“The PM has repeatedly set out that we must protect the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom as a whole.” GOT a story?

That seventh ping is almost exactly where the plane is.The northern corridor runs from southern China to Uzbekistan – a zone which spans over 1,400 miles – while the southern arc runs through the Indian Ocean where parts of the plane have been found.Wilsons images from Google Maps show the outline of a large plane in a remote part of southern Cambodia  – which could simply be an aircraft flying directly below the satellite which photographed it.Following the Brits revelation, and with a £53million finders fee up for grabs, a group of experts hired a helicopter to scour the area highlighted by Wilson.However, on September 13, it was reported that the group had failed to find anything in the zone where Wilson believes the plane crashed.The Chinese government also used observation company Space View to focus in on the high-altitude area of the south east Asian country.However, the firm claim there was no sign of any plane, least of all the Malaysian Airlines aircraft.In a tweet, Space View wrote: “Stakeholders and bystanders plead Space View to shoot at the site.So we found out three images, shot in 2015, 2016 and 2018 from our archive.Sorry, no plane found there.In July this year, the Malaysian government released the findings of their investigation admitting they still do not know what happened to thepassenger jet."},{"url":null,"title":"terrifying moment boy 5 dangles by neck from 130ft ferris wheel after climbing out when he was allowed to travel alone","story":"The boy is said to have tried to sit on the metal bars securing the open window of the Ferris wheel cabin when he slipped out.  Luckily he was caught by his neck and avoided plunging some 131 feet to his death.The heart-in-mouth moment happened on September 24 as the boy and his mum, known as Liu, visited the amusement park.But rather than pay the 30 RMB  on a ticket, she let her son ride alone after he repeatedly nagged her about it, with staff members reportedly allowing the oversight.As the boy’s car, number 18, reached the peak of the city landmark Ferris wheel, screams were heard from the ground as witnesses spotted the boy climbing out the window feet first.The shouting and screaming increased in intensity as the boy’s small body appeared to slip out the window between the metal security bars.Footage shows the boy desperately kicking his legs as he hangs by his neck some in the air, with no one in his car to help him back inside.When it became clear that the boy could not be helped, operators let the Ferris wheel continue to turn and waited as car 18 made its way to the ground agonisingly slowly.Staff members and other witnesses immediately rushed to the boy and freed him from the bars when he came within reach, the video shows.He and his mum were taken to the city’s First People’s Hospital, with the child fortunately suffering no serious injuries besides a bruised neck.City officials have reportedly shut down the Ferris wheel operations as investigations into the ordeal continue.A witness was quoted as saying: Children need to be accompanied by adults when riding the Ferris wheel. I don’t know how the mother convinced the staff members to let her son ride along in a car.Yuhuan Park’s amusement facilities were opened to the public in November 2013, the 137-foot instantly becoming its main attraction and Taizhou’s new landmark."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436517960","title":"labour six tests brexit second referendum keir starmer","story":"And Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said he wouldnt rule out extending the Article 50 process.Labour is expected to oppose any Brexit deal that fails to meet the partys six tests, Sir Starmer said.They are:Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he would be ready to back another EU referendum,  party members want one.He said he would be bound by the outcome of a vote at the Labour Party conference.Labour bigwigs have set out a new policy which could see the party supporting a fresh referendum  Theresa May refuses to call a General Election.The motion, which members will vote on today at the party conference in Liverpool, says: “Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote.”But the policy was blown apart when Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell suggested the second referendum WOULDN’T include an option to remain in the EU.Speaking on the BBC’s Today programme, the hard-left veteran said: “We’ve said we want a people’s vote  we can’t get a General Election.“We accept the last referendum - we want a General Election,  we can’t get that we want some form of democratic option.”Speaking to ITVs Good Morning Britain, he added: It will be about whether you accept the deal or not or whether you send people back to negotiate a proper deal.And he told BBC Radio 5 Live: My big worry is that  we go for a referendum which is seen as just a simple re-run we could ide the country again, we could get almost the same result or  its slightly dferent that people demand another referendum.Shadow Brexit Secretary said he wouldnt rule out extending the Article 50 process, under which the UK is set to quit the bloc in March 2019.He told TalkRadio this morning : Well the answer is it depends, because we dont know when were going to get a deal.I dont think at this stage anybody is talking about extending Article 50 but  it has to be extended quite frankly it will be because of the collapsing failure of the discussions and the negotiations.He said that his party are not likely to vote for any deal that Mrs May brings back from Brussels - because it wont meet the partys six tests.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Time, therefore, is short.A referendum requires legislation through Parliament.The EU Referendum Act paving the way for the vote in June 2016 took seven months to get through both Houses, after wrangling about the wording of the question, the franchise and the campaign period.Official campaigns were then designated and the actual vote was held six months after that.All the campaign groups for a second poll concede that the government would need to ask the EU for an extension to Article 50. A former EU official tells me extra time is much more likely to be granted for a second referendum than, for example, a general election, but the EU would want it \"done and dusted\" before the European elections in May.\"If it\u0027s longer than that they\u0027ll probably just want us out.\"The Best for Britain and People\u0027s Vote campaign groups insist that the time pressure MPs would be under would force the arrangements to progress quickly, plausibly in as little as four months after Mrs May puts her deal to Parliament.:: Why should we have it?The argument supporters make is that a lot has changed since the Vote Leave buses promised \u0026#163350m a week, and trade secretary Liam Fox claimed a trade deal with the EU would be \"the easiest deal in human history\".

Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer will give the strongest signal yet that he will order MPs to reject the deal in Parliament. Such a vote could spell catastrophic defeat for the Prime Minister - as it would see Labour join forces with Tory Brexiteers in the Commons. Sir Keir today declared that  that happens, on any rational view the government will then have to fall - triggering a general election. And on Tuesday, he will tell Labour\u0027s party conference in Liverpool: Some have said Labour could vote for any deal the Tories reach. Some have said we may abstain. Some have said we may support a vague deal – a ‘blind Brexit’ – that gives no detail about the terms of our future relationship.  So, let me be very clear - right here, right now: If Theresa May brings back a deal that fails our tests – and that looks increasingly likely - Labour will vote against it. No s, no buts. And  the Prime Minister thinks we’ll wave through a vague deal asking us to jump blindfolded into the unknown she can think again. You can’t meet Labour’s tests by failing to provide answers. We will vote down a blind Brexit. The comments lay down the gauntlet to Mrs May ahead of a crunch vote on her deal sometime in November. Sir Keir has set six tests  that the plan must meet before Labour will back it.  But Labour is still riven with disagreement over whether to back a second referendum on Brexit. Delegates will vote on Tuesday to keep the option of a public vote on the table - not actually back a public vote - after a six-hour meeting ended in a fudge. And a split erupted after Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell suggested any vote wouldn\u0027t have the option of remaining in the EU - only to be contradicted by Sir Keir.

Currently dogs , cats and ferrets can travel anywhere in the EU as long as they have a pet passport. Currently, the main requirement is that three weeks before the first visit, owners must go to the vet to have their pet vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. But in the worst case no-deal Brexit, pet owners would have to visit a vet at least FOUR MONTHS before visiting the EU. This means pet owners intending to travel to the EU on 30 March 2019 would need to discuss requirements with their vet before the end of November 2018, the papers warn. The animal would have to have a rabies vaccination followed by a blood test at least 30 days before travel, to prove the vaccination worked. Once that was completed, the pet owner would have to visit a vet to obtain a health certicate. But this cannot be done more than 10 days before the date the holiday starts. This is the worst case scenario. In another form of No Deal Brexit, the UK could be made a listed third country. This would increase red tape but not as much, with a visit to the vet only needed three weeks before travel.  British airlines hoping to fly planes between the bloc and the UK would have to win permission from each separate country, the latest Brexit technical notices said. European firms wanting to carry passengers between Britain and the continent would have to seek authority from the UK. The notice says: “In this scenario the UK would envisage granting permission to EU airlines to continue to operate. “We would expect EU countries to reciprocate in turn. “It would not be in the interest of any EU country or the UK to restrict the choice of destinations that could be served, though  such permissions are not granted, there could be disruption to some flights.” UK airlines would also lose the automatic right to fly planes between two EU destinations, such as Milan and Paris. 3. Planes might be grounded  they fail new safety checks  Planes issued with safety certicates in the UK could be grounded  European officials fail to recognise the accreditation, under a no-deal Brexit. EU officials could decide not to allow British pilots and aircraft certied by the UK\u0027s Civil Aviation Authority to operate in EU skies. Britain has said it would continue to recognise licences and certicated authorised by the Eureopan Aviation Safety Agency. But the technical notice says: “The EU has indicated that it would take a dferent approach to the UK. The information notices issued by the European Commission say that certicates previously issued by the before exit day would no longer be automatically accepted in the system after 29 March 2019.” Pilots and firms hoping to operate in the EU should consult the bloc, the note adds.  Qualications issued by CAA-approved organisations “would no longer be valid for use with EU operators after exit day”, the document warns. UK firms could also be shut out of maintenance contracts and supplying aircraft parts. 5. You might have to go through airport security TWICE  Air passengers changing flights in the EU may have to undergo two security screenings under a no-deal exit. Travellers boarding a plane in the UK to fly to a European airport before changing flights for an onward destination would be screened in Britain as now. But they might have to have a second check in the EU before getting their connecting flight. “Currently passengers flying from the UK and transferring at an EU airport for an onward flight do not have to be re-screened at that EU airport, because the UK applies, and exceeds, the EU baseline aviation security measures,” says the Department for Transport briefing note. “If there is no deal, and the EU decides not to recognise the UK aviation security system, then passengers and their luggage will have to be re-screened when changing flights in EU hub airports.” 6. Truck drivers will need new permits - and there almost certainly won\u0027t be enough to go around  Thousands of truck drivers could be locked out of EU countries as their permits to carry freight across the continent become null and void. If there\u0027s a No Deal Brexit, UK hauliers will no longer have the automatic right to be let through EU nations\u0027 borders under the current permit system. Instead,  no other deal comes into force, they have to apply for an \u0027ECMT\u0027 permit - and there are only a set number of these available per year. For one type of these annual permits, just 984 are issued per year, the documents say. The no deal papers warn explicitly that demand for the permits will signicantly exceed supply and firms should prepare for getting fewer than they ask for. They will be allocated through a formula that was laid down in law earlier this year, and successful applicants will be contacted at the end of 2018. Haulage firms have been warned by the government to draw up contingency plans for  they end up unable to use some of their fleet. 7. Car insurance will get more complicated  Hauliers and holidaymakers driving to the EU will be forced to apply for a \u0027green card\u0027 to prove they have the right car insurance. The certicates are free of charge and available from insurance companies. But the government warns firms may increase administration fees in order to cope with the extra bureaucracy. Those who forget their green cards would be forced to buy expensive frontier insurance in the country they are visiting.  Meat and animal product imports from the EU, but which originate outside the EU, would be subject to additional checking at Border Inspection Posts. The government says staff will be trained to “minimise the impact” of the increased number of import checks, and “reduce the chance of delays.” 9.

But in recent years they have come under enormous pressure. Too often we see boarded-up shops and units sitting empty or independent local businesses priced out, victims of soaring business rates, rent hikes and undercutting by online retailers. The Government’s decision to hike business rates following the 2017 revaluation left many small, independent companies lumbered with extortionate bills they simply cannot pay. In the past 12 months alone, 51,504 businesses on UK high streets closed while 42,166 opened – a net loss of 9,338.

Research shows one in four toddlers in the UK refuse food every day but biochemist Dr Gill Hart claims parents should not automatically assume youngsters are being ‘picky’. Dr Hart, scientic director at Yorkshire food intolerance testing firm YorkTest, believes a young child refusing to eat certain foods may be their way of communicating an underlying intolerance which they can’t express in words.  She sad: “It’s important parents realise that a fussy eater can sometimes have underlying food intolerances .  A child can lose their appetite because they may not be able to articulate to their parents that they are getting tummy pains.  And  a child does complain of having a sore tummy, it’s very dficult for the parent to recognise that this may be caused by the food they are eating. “Also, quite often a child might call their symptoms tummy pains, when they are in fact suffering bloating or bowel problems.” Research suggests some of the most common food intolerances are reactions to dairy products, chocolate, eggs, food additives, strawberries, citrus fruits and tomatoes. Symptoms include tummy pain, bloating, wind, diarrhoea, skin rashes and even itching. Food intolerances are dferent to allergies, which affect the body’s immune system and often cause almost instant reactions. In contrast, intolerances can take 72 hours to appear, making it very dficult to pinpoint the offending food. Dr Hart warns that just because a child doesn’t experience a gut reaction to a food doesn’t mean they are not having a reaction to it. The effects of a food intolerance can be wide-ranging.  She says it’s all down to the food-specic IgG antibody, which YorkTest measures to determine reactions to possible problem foods, revealing: “If you have got any sort of imbalance, the reactions you get with an IgG reaction can cause inflammation and the inflammation could then cause a range of problems in dferent parts of the body. “It’s not necessarily related to the gut. It depends on that person’s makeup. “And when the trigger food is removed from a child’s diet, the ‘fussy’ child could then develop a healthy appetite because he or she is not frightened about eating foods that result in tummy ache. “In a sense, you can ‘grow out of’ a food intolerance. Once the food has been identied as a problem, the first step is to remove the food that’s causing the inflammation, because it could be presenting a range of dferent symptoms.  “And our nutritional therapists can work with people to help heal their guts, frequently using probiotics that can reinoculate the gut with lots of good bacteria. “They can also offer things like digestive enzymes which can really help you break down your food properly. “And then, once you have removed the foods that are triggering the reaction and you look after your gut as well, you may start to tolerate the foods which have previously caused problems. “For me, it’s all about choice. With the right information, people have the knowledge of what works for them and what doesn’t. “It is then a balance between the reaction and the impact it has on you.” Figures released by Allergy UK in 2009 estimated as many as 45 per cent of Brits could be affected by food intolerance. ow’s milk is one of the most common childhood food intolerances.

The 34-year-old penned a heartbreaking letter from prison - saying she \u0027just wants to come home\u0027. The former shop worker from Hull was jailed on Boxing Day last year for carrying hundreds of painkillers in her suitcase. She hoped the Egyptian appeal court would accept that she had no way of knowing the tramadol pills were banned.  But she was left in tears after judges in Cairo upheld her conviction and three-year prison sentence, The Sun reports .  Laura\u0027s Egyptian husband Omar Saad, 34, broke the news to her inside the notorious Al Qanater prison, where she is living in a squalid cell with 20 other women in 34C heat.   In a handwritten letter, given to The Sun , Laura said: I was sure they would see sense. This whole situation is just ridiculous. I just want to come home.  She also hit out at the UK Foreign Office, who she says refuses to intervene on her behalf. She added: How can they leave me in here? Laura was sentenced to three years in prison for carrying 290 tramadol tablets into the north African country while on holiday in October 2017. She was arrested and charged despite her pleas that the painkillers were for husband Omar’s bad back.  Speaking to The Sun, Laura said: What don’t these people get? I wonder  I’ve died and this is hell. What did I do that was so wrong in my le to end up here? I thought the appeal judges would see sense and realise I couldn’t have known the tablets were banned. It’s just so absurd.  Her older brother Kirk recently told of the “emotional rollercoaster” the whole family have been on since she was imprisoned. In an interview with Viking FM, Mr Plummer said: “I wouldn’t wish what me and my family are going through on anybody, nobody. “No one wants to see their daughter or sister in prison and  it happened to them then they would realise just how bad it is.  “But what we are going through is nothing compared to what Laura is going through in prison out there. “You sometimes just sit and think and it hits you again that she is still there and as a family we are trying to get on and lead a normal le but it’s hard and you are constantly reminded that she is still there with 20 other women sat on a cell floor. “The last six months have been an emotional rollercoaster and you get ups and downs. “One minute you are angry she even went to Egypt and then you get mad that she’s been arrested for what she did.”  Shortly into her imprisonment, one of Laura’s sisters, Jayne, revealed how Laura had been “kicked and punched” in jail and said she would be “amazed”  her younger sister survived her three-year ordeal.

The couple looked as loved up as ever at the event, and they even shared a cute hug after Prince Harry won one of the games they were playing.   Despite her high heels, Meghan joined in all the games and they looked like they were having a lot of fun.  Meghan is wearing black flared trousers again, very similar to the ones she wore at the WellChild Awards earlier this month .  She teamed them with a blue belted top by Oscar de la Renta.

Clara Malagon, who had been struggling with self doubt and bouts of depression for some time, had been on-duty on the night of the atrocity. She witnessed first-hand horric injuries sustained by the young victims, but the 22-year-old successfully underwent counselling and had a detailed debrief about the bombing with senior doctors afterwards. However, in July last year just seven weeks after the tragedy, Miss Malagon was found hanged at her Manchester city centre apartment.  It is not known why she killed herself. An inquest this week heard Miss Malagon from Twickenham, south west London had completed a degree in nursing at Manchester University and became a critical care nurse at Manchester Royal Infirmary in 2016. She was a keen rower and enjoyed cycling, running and walking and also played the viola and took up ballet and flamenco dancing. But Miss Malagon also suffered bouts of depression and self doubt and had been prescribed the antidepressant Citallipram.  Her father Dr Ignacio Malagon, a consultant anaesthatist at Wythenshawe Hospital wept as he told the Manchester hearing: She was physically quite tough but she was seeing her GP for mental health issues - we talked about it regularly. She was good at taking instructions from her GP and we talked about counselling. Out of the blue she started crying at university, she would come to me but I couldn\u0027t give her professional advice so I advised her to go and talk to someone. She went to counselling organised by university - everything was going well so she came off the medication. But in January last year she started crying again, and she said to me \u0027Dad, I need help.\u0027 After she had been to the GP she was told it was going to be three months before she was going to get any counselling, she said she couldn\u0027t wait for three months and said she wanted to go private.  She found one counsellor but she didn\u0027t like them. We were talking about money and I offered to help her out. I gave her some money to pay for the first few sessions and she found one she did like. She was able to organise the counselling herself. She said she was happy with the lady she found. He added: Clara was a staff nurse but she had done a training course in intensive care. She was on duty in May last year during the Arena attack. It was traumatic for her and I rang her, I was in hospital too, and I said to her: \u0027Are you OK?\u0027 And she said: \u0027Yeah Dad, it\u0027s really tough, I\u0027ve seen some of the kids didn\u0027t make it.\u0027 We had a long chat and I said to her that I realise this is very traumatic for her and  she was upset then she should tell her seniors, or  she felt unwell she should tell her managers. I just said to her not to worry and that it was going to be fine.  A few days after there was a debriefing provided by the MRI. She rang me afterwards and said there had been 50 people there including her seniors and management. Everyone there told how wonderful the team had worked and she was delighted. We talked on a regular basis, either over a glass of wine or dinner. If she had an issue she would talk about it to me in a professional manner  it was to do with work. I was involved  she wanted to talk about anything. She would tell me about the patients she helped, she never said she felt understaffed or overworked. She shared everything with me. I had a very good relationship with my daughter.  When she felt stressed she would share it and talk with me. In the weeks leading up to her death, there were none such conversations. On the weekend before she was due to come for her dinner. She said she was on the train and she was very busy with things and she had been visiting a friend in London - there was no dference in her at all. Miss Malagon\u0027s flatmate Grace Callaghan who found her friend on her  home from work said: She had said to me she was feeling low and she made an appointment with her doctor to prescribe some more antidepressants. \u0027But that weekend we said we would have to have a curry night as we had not seen each other properly. She was one of the loveliest people I ever knew - on the night before there wasn\u0027t any concern about her. GP Dr Gill Aitken said Miss Malagon had been prescribed Citrallipram but in September 2016 she came off it and finished her nursing degree.  In a statement Dr Aitken said: She came back to me and said she was feeling low and crying, and feeling apathetic. Whilst there was no trigger, I believe this was work related. She was anxious about work, she had her own self doubt and confidence issues and she said she wasn\u0027t sleeping. But she denied any suicidal thoughts. She said she wanted some medication and I suggested a review in two weeks time, which she did. She said she had been back to Spain for a few weeks but she felt upset and felt guilty for not being a happy person to be around at the time. She had contacted a Manchester self help group. I asked  there were any issues at work and she said there had been some complex patients. She said she had no suicidal thoughts. She told me her family were a strong protective factor for her. I told her who to contact  she felt in crisis and said  she needed anything she could make an emergency appointment with the team.  Police examined Miss Malagon\u0027s iPad and laptop but found no evidence she would take her own le - with one message to a friend in a social media chat saying she had a successful counselling session. Recording a conclusion of suicide, Coroner Andrew Bridgman said: Clara had her full professional le ahead of her. Her father has told me that she was a fit and active young woman who had lots of hobbies. But it is clear from the evidence that she had mental health issues from around 2016 which correspond with her final year of her degree. She was on medication for around 6-7 months, to which she came off it and appeared to be fine. However this resurfaces towards mid June 2017 - three to four weeks following the Manchester Arena tragedy when she was on duty. It clearly had some effect on her however I have had a discussion with her father, and there was no specic reference to the trauma of the events of that night. She sought therapy and she did take private counselling, and found this helped her. Clara did intend to take her le but this inquest cannot answer why.

Storms Ali and Bronagh brought high winds, heavy rain and flooding, with the Met Office issuing several danger to le warnings. This week has been feeling brisk, but temperatures are now on the up. On Thursday it will reach 22C in London and areas in the south-east, making the country warmer than Greece.    Wales, the Midlands and the South will get the best of the good weather, with almost constant sunshine and only patches of cloud on Thursday. For the majority of the country the temperature will remain around 20C throughout the day, with light winds making it feel signicantly warmer.  The North will unfortunately not be so lucky with the weather. Instead of the Indian Summer, the Met Office has said that they will see more wind, outbreaks of rain and even some gales throughout the week. Today will see more fine weather, with sun and milder temperatures across the southern half of the UK hitting an average of around 15 degrees by tomorrow.

The company has rebranded as WW with the tag line Wellness that Works in a bid to focus on overall health rather than just losing weight. The company\u0027s chief executive Mindy Grossman said the new name is the the next stage of the company\u0027s evolution, and the brand has promised lots of other exciting changes in the near future. However she said the WW doesn\u0027t stand for Wellness that Works - but wouldn\u0027t say what it actually meant.  She said: We are committed to always being the best weight management program on the planet, but now we\u0027re putting our decades of knowledge and expertise in behavioral science to work for an even greater mission. We are becoming the world\u0027s partner in wellness.

Earlier this year the company also announced it was dropping before and after photos in a bid to promote long-term change.  The company\u0027s website has already been branded, and the app will now include lots of more general health features for customers to enjoy. American chat show host Oprah Winfrey, who uses the programme and now works to promote the charity, has thrown her support behind the new brand.  She said: From the moment I chose to invest in the company and join the Board, I have believed that the role WW can play in people\u0027s lives goes far beyond a number on the scale. As Weight Watchers becomes WW, I believe we will continue to inspire people not only to eat well, but to move more, connect with others and continue to experience the joys of a healthy le. WW has also launched a new programme - WellnessWins - which will give customers rewards  they complete small, everyday healthy behaviours.

Lisa Stout spotted the elusive beast by simply trawling through Google Earth shots taken three years ago.  The startling discovery has now been accepted as the ninth sighting of the monster this year by the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register - and highlights the lasting interest in the mythical creature.  Ironically the 31-year-old from Bellevue, Ohio, has a monster - Bessie - on her doorstep, but has never seen it. According to Google there are 200,000 searches each month for the Loch Ness Monster.  As a result of a recent loss of employment, I\u0027ve had a lot of time open up. I had been searching for Nessie on/off for the past few weeks, spending an hour or so a week on Google Earth as well as other places I like to visit in the App, said Ms Stout, a mother-of-one. I had seen some of the latest Nessie sightings and thought that I can definitely find a better image of her than that which I used for motivation to challenge myself to find her! Last Thursday at 9.45am, I had got my daughter off to school and began to search for Nessie when I noticed a cluster of pictures taken by an Underwater Earth Contributor all in one area near the Loch Ness Highland Resort in Fort Augustus. I noticed what I believe may be the creature known as Nessie - or at the very least what makes up for most of the accounts of Nessie sightings that residents/ tourists are seeing and reporting.  Ms Stout said she believes the dark figure protruding from the water is at least three to five feet tall which I believe to be is Nessie\u0027s neck and it also appears rather flat giving the neck a width of at least one foot. It looks like the inner part of the neck and at the top there is a glare on the right side of what appears to be her head but on the left side there may be evidence of an eye and partial lining of the mouth, she said. I was unsure at first  what I was seeing was a right side \u0027fin\u0027 in the image but now I more so believe that it may be more of the \u0027main body\u0027 that you can see along the surface of the water. There appears to be a large crease in her neck and skins appears rough/ scaly whereas the rest of her body appears smoother. I have heard the story about the Loch Ness Monster almost as far back as I can remember. I hope this image will help keep her story alive as I believe her existence will plague the imagination of several generations of people to come.  We live very close to Lake Erie where I often like to scout for the Southern Bay Bessie Monster... but Bessie seems to be a lot more shy then Nessie! It is not the first time internet sleuths have used Google to unearth Nessie. Google Maps footage of the Loch Ness Monster was previously discovered by users searching on street view. Map users are convinced the image, which portrays a long humped figure, is the famous creature. The long, narrow shape and four humps visible above the water\u0027s surface are consistent with previous sightings of the monster. Nessie enthusiast Bjarne Sj strand noticed a long, thin object in the water on Google Earth while on his computer 800 miles away in Sweden.  The then 52-year-old, who has never even been to Scotland, won the best Loch Ness Monster sighting of 2014, in an annual competition run by William Hill bookies. Sightings of the Loch Ness Monster set new global records last year - thanks to the internet. Nessie\u0027s official recorder said the 11 accepted sightings in 2017 spanned the planet. In June last year a Canadian woman also took two videos from the Loch Ness Webcam while watching the water from more than 5000 miles away. An increasing number of sightings are now online from people all over the world, said Gary Campbell, the recorder and keeper of the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register. Mr Campbell said two of last year\u0027s sightings were also by webcam, including one from an online watcher in America.

When it became clear that the boy could not be helped, operators let the Ferris wheel continue to turn and waited as car 18 made its way to the ground agonisingly slowly. Staff members and other witnesses immediately rushed to the boy and freed him from the bars when he came within reach. He and his mum were taken to the city\u0027s First People\u0027s Hospital, with the child suffering no serious injuries besides a bruised neck.

just 15 and being a publican since she was 28 has helped Annemarie Findlay in customer care – and she has now found her passion at electronic cigarette store Refill Station.The new shop, on the Murraygate, opened earlier this month and provides an alternative to smokers in Dundee wanting to kick the unhealthy habit.Annemarie runs the store and says the rise in popularity of e-cigs has been down to a more health-conscious population.She said: “People these days are definitely more health-conscious and want an alternative to smoking cigarettes.“Over the last 10 years or so liquids and electric cigarette machines have become so erse that our shop has something for everyone from 18-80.”Although admitting that before she first started in the industry four years ago she knew little about e-cigarettes, she now sees the business as her passion.She said: “It has well and truly turned into a passion.“I am constantly learning about dferent machines and e-liquids and quite often customers will come in and teach me something I don’t know.“The customers are at the forefront, we have each and every flavour available to try and we aim that no one will leave this store with a

Dundee’s players, it’s time to produce the goods today at home to Hibs  they are to finally get some Premiership points on the board, according to midfield man Paul McGowan.In his usual no-nonsense fashion, McGowan admits the Dark Blues “haven’t been good enough” this season.That’s left them rooted to the foot of the table with no points to their name.The 30-year-old, though, is adamant Dundee have the ability to get themselves out of the trouble they find themselves in.He said: “A bit of luck is just missing for us right now but we need to make our own luck.“We need to start finishing the chances we are creating and we’re not keeping clean sheets.“That doesn’t bode well for trying to get the three points but we need to stick together, start from a clean sheet and then, hopefully, finish off a chance.“Listen, I could sit here and go through all sorts of stuff but it’s time to man up now and be counted.“It will be hard out there, the crowd will be on us a wee bit and rightly so with the way we have started but we need to overcome that and, hopefully, get them onside by putting in a performance.“We need to give them something to shout about because they haven’t had that.”And McGowan says he has no problem with having to deal with a bit of stick from the stands.“The fans have paid money so they’re entitled to have a moan because we’ve not been playing that well,” he added.“We accept that, we’re grown men and  you can’t take criticism then you shouldn’t be in this game.”After a 4-0 tanking at Ibrox last week where the Dark Blues were blown away in the early stages, trailing 2-0 within 15 minutes, McGowan has urged his team-mates to be more streetwise going forward.“You’ve got to weather that first 10, 15 minutes or so and we didn’t.“We gted them two goals and you can’t do that at Ibrox – you can’t do that against any team in this league.“We need to be more streetwise with how the game is going,  we’re under it a bit, just sit in and soak up the pressure until the game settles down a bit. We need to learn that.“Inidual mistakes are costing us and we’re getting punished for them all.“It’s amazing how quickly football can change. At the start of the season we had the chance to go 2-1 up at St Mirren but missed the penalty and then we conceded a freak goal.“Things like that can just turn and luck starts going against you but, listen, we haven’t been good enough.“I’m not going to make excuses or any rubbish like that – we haven’t been good enough and that’s down to the players.“We need to stand up and be counted and start showing how good a football team we are. We need to produce, starting today.“I believe in every one of us that we are good enough to get out of the situation we’re in.“It’s only five games into the season, a couple of wins gets us right up there.“I know we are a good footballing side, it’s the other side we need, being hard to beat and getting clean sheets.”The Dens men come up against a formidable attacking outfit when Neil Lennon’s Hibs come to town – McGowan, though, is certain Dundee can cause some problems of their own.He added: “Hibs are good going forward but they can be got at at the back. They are expansive, have a go, that’s the way Lenny like’s it but he’ll have them well-drilled and well up for it.“It’ll be a big ask for us to get the three points but I’m pretty sure we can.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united boss csaba pleased to have more options for falkirk clash","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United manager Csaba Laszlo admits he is relieved to, finally, have close to a full squad to choose from.Csaba will have more at his disposal for the clash at Championship bottom side Falkirk today and could hand starts to key men Fraser Fyvie and Billy King.Both are rated touch and go while Sam Stanton, Nicky Clark and Stewart Murdoch are working their way back to full training.Csaba said: “We have spoken with Fraser and he still hasn’t decided but he is not far enough along psychologically but I think, definitely, he will be part of the squad.“We are looking to protect the player in the long term, not just one game.“It will be a decision between him and me.

I am not a player made for playing without any pressure because then I wouldn’t be playing well.“I need pressure to thrive and it’s a big club – it should be in the Premiership.“It’s about how we deal with the pressure and Dundee United is probably the team with the most pressure on it in this league.“You feel like the fans definitely want to get out of the Championship. I want to get out of the Championship as well.“I’m not coming here to play my two seasons on my contract in the Championship.“It’s going to be a tough game and, in this league, every game is tough.

Everybody can beat each other.”After disappointing draws against Alloa and Morton in recent weeks, Frans knows there can be no more excuses.He has captained the side in the absence of the likes of Fraser Fyvie and Stewart Murdoch and feels they are now more equipped, with their ‘leaders’ coming back to the squad, to go on a winning run.“If you look at the way we played last weekend, we had 11 players starting who weren’t here last year but still we produce some good stuff,” he added.“We need to be more efficient. We missed a few chances but also we concede every game.“I do think we defend well but somehow we concede a penalty and the week before it was a free-kick against Alloa.“It is not because of bad defending, just small things, and we need to get better at them.“I think you see every week we are improving but, OK, there comes a time you need to put it in results and start to go on a run.“You see Fraser Fyvie coming back, Billy King, Sam Stanton is still injured, Murdoch is out.“These are players who would walk into a lot of Championship teams and be the leaders.“There are positive things to look forward to.”United will go toe-to-toe with pointless bottom side Falkirk today on an articial surface.However, Frans says they will not be using that or the ongoing stormy weather as excuses for another disappointing display.“I don’t like to talk about the pitch because I don’t want to have any excuses. Whatever pitch it is we should play well.“We went to Queen of the South and I think the first half we produced one of the best performances since I’ve been here.“You come up against dferent circumstances and maybe it’s going to be 100mph wind.“Every week it’s something so  you think too much about circumstances you are not focused.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"falkirk boss ray mckinnon looks ahead to clash with old club dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRay McKinnon accepts there will be an added dimension to this weekend’s game against old club Dundee United because he is only “human”.However, the Falkirk manager is adamant his sole focus will be on trying to land a first league win of the season for his new team.McKinnon will be facing United for the first time since being sacked by the Tangerines in October last year.He was axed just 10 games into the season with the Tannadice outfit in fourth place and just five points off the top of the Championship.He said: “I’m treating it just as another game but I am human, so I am naturally going to look at all the scenarios.“However, the focus will definitely be just on us and making sure we are set up properly.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b9a3066643d7.jpg ","title":"folk from across the world coming to dundee to learn about va and waterfront","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn international delegation of design cities will descend on Dundee next month to discover the story behind the new V\u0026ampA museum and Waterfront regeneration.Dundee City Council leader John Alexander confirmed representatives from the 20 Unesco Cities of Design, which include Beijing, Buenos Aires, Bilbao, Turin and Berlin, will visit Dundee for at least three days from October 17.It is seen as a major coup for the city, which had to beat off competition from two other prominent European locations.Mr Alexander said: “There was a real interest in coming to Dundee and seeing it first-hand because they’ve heard so much.

unclear  ambitious plans for a new hotel on the site of a former Inverness swimming pool have been permanently sunk by councillors\u0026rsquo rejection of the project.The south Highland planning committee narrowly refused to grant planning permission for a 168-bedroom hotel, restaurant, bar and leisure complex at Glebe Street in Inverness because of the design.Keppie Design\u0027 visualisation was iously branded \"bogging, hideous\" and reminiscent of bleak architecture from the \"Stalinist\" era. The developer, Dutch property firm Vastint Hospitality, could not be contacted.A y Inverness debate ended on Tuesday with an 8-7 vote to refuse the application despite Ness-side SNP councillor Ron MacWilliam\u0027 insistence that the vision was that of \"a grand building, that you\u0026rsquod expect to see in a serious city centre\".Inverness Central ward party colleague Richard Laird, however, successfully argued that it \"failed to make a positive contribution to the city\u0027 architecture,\" and therefore contravened the local plan.He described the design as \"absolutely bogging\" and \"exactly the same as some of those we\u0026rsquore so desperate to tear down in the middle of Inverness\".He and several committee colleagues were also concerned about the potential impact of future traffic movement in Waterloo Place and Glebe Street as a result of the proposed development.There was general support for a hotel to be built at the location but Cllr Laird said the drawing board proposition \"looks exactly the same as some of those we\u0026rsquore so desperate to teardown in the middle of Inverness\" \u0026ndash a reference to the council\u0027 recent approval for bulldozing and replacing the \u0026lsquo60s-built Bridge Street \"blots on the landscape\".Committee colleague Bill Lobban considered the hotel design \"hideous\".He said: \"It\u0027 the most visible site in the whole of Inverness. It\u0027 a very important site but it deserves something better than this. This Lego-style block might have been contemporary in 1960s East Germany looking from the wrong side of the Berlin Wall.\"Echoing that, Councillor Andrew Baxter said he had seen similar \"Stalinist\" architecture in Moldova.Peter Andrews, managing director of Vastint Hospitality, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore disappointed. We want to wait to see the council\u0027 written reasons for refusal.\u0026ldquoWhen we\u0026rsquove had a chance to review it with Keppies and probably a planning consultant then we\u0026rsquoll decide what we\u0026rsquore going to do.A spokesman for Keppie Design said: \"We\u0026rsquore naturally disappointed by the narrow decision to refuse planning permission for the scheme as it stands, despite officers recommending approval.\"The design is an honest, contemporary response to a high-profile site, using a selection of high-quality materials and massing relevant to the hotel use.\"The detail of the aesthetic and the proportions of the design have been signicantly remodelled following several post-submission meetings with the planning authority.\"Former Highland planning chairman Thomas Prag, who opposed a previous development proposal for the site while a serving councillor, said he was \"relieved\" his successors had done the same.\"I\u0026rsquom disappointed with the architects, who are well known and do some great stuff,\" he said.\"I think they were too constrained by their client\u0027 building methods.

absinthe first","story":"\u0026nbspA DOCTOR and a former detective have joined forces to launch Scotland\u0027 first absinthe blanche using ingredients hand-picked from around their 500-year-old ancestral home by the shores of Loch Ness.The couple, Lorien and Kevin Cameron-Ross, creators of the award-winning Loch Ness Gin, developed the recipe for Loch Ness Absinthe, both distilled at their home on the banks of the loch, following a trip to the birthplace of the spirit, Val-de-Travers in Switzerland.It was there Lorien learned to fine-tune the craft of making absinthe which was first used as a medicinal remedy by a French doctor living in the country, Pierre Ordinaire around the 1790s.Although best known as absinthe verte, the notorious \"green drink\", popular in the late 19th and early 20th century among artists and writers in Paris, with Vincent Van Gogh and Ernest Hemmingway among its devotees, the couple decided to create their own Scottish blanche recipe.Blanche absinthe dates back to 1910 following the ban of green absinthe in ious countries \u0026ndash although not in the UK \u0026ndash due to unproven fears it had hallucinogenic properties resulting from the use of thujone, a component of wormwood.This led to the illegal production of clear absinthe in Switzerland, making it harder for the authorities to identy.Lorien said: \"We are really proud of our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe, boasting our very own homegrown botanicals including wormwood mixed with nearby fresh water which flows into the famous loch.\"We felt there was gap in the market for an absinthe blanche in Scotland, a drink I really enjoy, so decided to put the wheels in motion last year and began to research its history and fully understand the craft of creating and distilling it.\"Loch Ness Absinthe, with a ABV of 53 per cent, is less potent that absinthe verte, which is usually around 72 per cent.The couple, who are firm believers in mindful drinking where you drink less and enjoy yourself more, recommend that Loch Ness Absinthe should be enjoyed slowly as an aperit, ideally in a mix of one-part absinthe to three parts iced water, poured over a sugar cube on the glass\u0027 rim.Lorien continued: \"I\u0026rsquove worked really hard to get the recipe for our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe exactly the way I wanted and in the process perfected the art of distilling it to get the exact results I was looking for.\"With the help and support of Kevin, I\u0026rsquove created a drink that I\u0026rsquom really pleased with, which has already received fantastic feedback, leading to us driving our plans forward to launch even more products in the near future that will continue to be inspired by the loch and the land around us.\"Tuesday 25 Sep 2018

They have since gathered more than 14,500 signatures.And the march looks set to go ahead as planned after Highland Council revealed that the objections made in the original petition \"are not sufficient reason\" to refuse it. The local authority said objections on moral grounds were not a material matter when its licensing department decides whether to approve the temporary traffic restrictions that allow marches to proceed.It added that the petition against the march is \"being considered separately\" through its regular petitions procedures by its legal service team.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Highland Council, Licensing has received a request for a parade on October 6 in Inverness.\"This is currently being considered under consultation with Police Scotland and the council\u0027 roads team.\"A decision on the parade will be made [this] week and a Temporary Traffic Restriction Order would be required for the march.\" They added: \"The matters raised in the petition are not sufficient reason for the council to refuse permission for the parade, and the petition is being considered separately.\"Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has accused Highland Council of \u0026lsquomoving the goalposts\u0026rsquo after claiming it had shted a deadline for views on the march to be submitted.He said his petition was submitted on September 7 \u0026ndash which he argued was the last date for comments \u0026ndash and that he had since heard the deadline had moved back to September 21.\"One cannot help but wonder whether the circulation of two online petitions, in favour of the Proud Ness march, both created within 24 hours on and around 11 September, prompted Highland Council to review and then quickly change their date, so as to accommodate the cravings of these petitioners,\" he said.\"Everyone can clearly see that the subtle and suspicious date change is most conspicuous, just as it is deeply alarming.\"Surely it is wholly inappropriate for... Highland Council to act in a manner, that very much appears to be deceptive and gives the impression of being supportive of these counter online petitions.\"Following the council\u0027 insistence that the petition\u0027 objection is not a material licensing matter, it is not clear what dference a later deadline would have made over any decision. It is also not uncommon for councils to push consultation dates back in order for extra views to be aired.Meanwhile, the creator of one of the petitions in favour of the march has spoken of her delight at the amount of support they have received.Alice Masheter said the response had been \"fantastic\" and that, even though she is not a member of the LGBT+ community, she had felt compelled to set a petition up in solidarity to show that everyone is \"accepted and welcomed up here\".She said the pro-march petitions show that the LGBT+ community \"do have a huge amount of support\" and anti-march views are \"in the minority\".Tuesday 25 Sep 2018 11:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117654.jpg","title":"Pensioner pleads for help with poorly cat","story":"\u0026nbspAn Inverness pensioner is appealing for help with her cat\u0027 medical treatment after discovering that her monthly pet plan does not cover the cost of an X-ray.Marie MacIver\u0027 five-year-old cat Charlie has a painful leg and needs the scan to determine what treatment can be given.However, Mrs MacIver, who relies on disability benefit, is unable to afford the X-ray, which will cost about \u0026pound300.She has now contacted the\u0026nbspmedia in a plea for kind-hearted Invernessians to come forward.\"There is no way I can afford to pay for the X-ray,\" she said.\"Since it\u0027 very dficult for me to get out, I have already had to pay for the vet to come to the house and give Charlie a medical, as well as a bottle of anti-inflammatories which cost \u0026pound29 and did nothing.\"I already pay \u0026pound10 a month for a pet plan but it doesn\u0026rsquot seem to cover anything.\"I have tried everywhere to get help with the vet\u0027 bills \u0026ndash the PDSA, RSPCA and Cats Protection, but I haven\u0026rsquot been able to get help from anywhere.\"I hate to see him in pain and I think it\u0027 getting worse.\"It came out of the blue about a month ago, and now it is just not going away.\"Mrs MacIver lives alone with Charlie and says she has a special bond with her little cat.\"He\u0027 my companion and is often the only company I have,\" she said.\"He sleeps on my bed and follows me into the kitchen, and he seems to know not to stray too far from the house because I need him.\"He\u0027 really more like a dog than a cat.\"I try my best to take care of him but things like this are very dficult, and it is such a shame because he is a lovely little cat.\"I need to help Charlie get better.\"\u0026nbspCan you help Mrs MacIver with the cost of Charlie\u0027 X-ray?

The competition is free to enter and all shops who enter will also be promoted to consumers through an online Indie Retail Directory.Shopkeepers can nominate their businesses until Sunday September 9 via bestsmallshops. A shortlist of 25 of the most impressive applications will be shortlisted by a panel made up of established representatives from the independent retail industry.The judges will be looking for evidence of a small shops\u0026#8217 entrepreneurial spirit, ways that they have been innovative in their business and what they have done to have a lasting positive impact on their community.The shortlisted small shops will be invited to a parliamentary reception on November 13 to meet their Member of Parliament and find out who will be crowned Best Small Shop 2018.Argyll and Bute has an amazing array of small shops which help support our rural economy and I would love to see them recognised.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,Since when is it okay for a man to stand in a layby and urinate in broad daylight?It has become more noticeable in recent years and is never a pleasant sight. It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers. We’re also continually looking to make our services even better to give customers greater convenience as they shop online.I’d like to make your readers aware of a few changes to their doorstep deliveries so there are no surprises.Customers expecting tracked items from large retailers are among those to benefit from these changes. If they are not at home when we deliver, they will now receive email/SMS notications on the whereabouts of their delivery. For customers who have provided their contact details, the notications will confirm when their items have been delivered to a neighbour, as well as specying the neighbour’s address.The \u0026#8216Something for You\u0026#8217 card is also going digital, making it easier for customers to retrieve their item  they are not at home when we deliver. Email and SMS notications will let customers either re-arrange their parcel delivery for another day or collect their item from their local Customer Service Point using relevant identication. Customers will no longer need to go home to collect the physical card \u0026#8211 which we’ll continue to post through letter boxes.And finally customers taking pre-paid parcels  to selected Royal Mail Customer Service Points will receive an acceptance scan as soon as they drop off their item thanks to new scanning technology.Gerry McAuley, delivery director, Glasgow Mail Centre.Sir,The Supreme Court appears to have come to a sensible decision for the terminally ill in its landmark right-to-die ruling.One year ago my adult children and I watched helplessly as a most loved, mentally alert member of our family, with terminal cancer, suffered a needlessly horrible and prolonged death.This, after the patient had pleaded, for two weeks, with family doctors and religious leaders to end the constant suffering by requesting some form of assisted dying.This Supreme Court decision has come too late for our loved one but hopefully Westminster and Holyrood will now each consider and pass a bill to allow assisted dying and prevent suffering for current and future patients.Gordon Caskie, Muasdale.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor 31","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 15/08/18, 5:40 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,I wanted to thank the folk on last Thursday\u0026#8217s 14.45 number 23 bus from Oban. I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautul and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they ed to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they ed to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terric work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live le as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them.

The kids have had a great time with their teams playing well, building team spirit and creating a positive impression of the soccer centre and Lochgilphead.The Red Star 2007 team as well as regularly taking part in the Oban Primary League has travelled to Mossend, Oban, Crieff, Campbeltown and Helensburgh.  The kids are really developing and getting ready to move up to nine aside from now and then eleven aside in August 2019. The 2008 team has been to Mossend, Oban, Ardencaple, Campbeltown, Helensburgh, Finnart and Airdrieonians and have also been taking part in the Oban Primary League.The 2009s, 2010s and 2011s have been on trips to Oban, Campbeltown and Helensburgh. The kids played four and five aside as well as being committed to regular additional training sessions. The future looks good for when they step up to seven aside.Finally the girls team took part in both Oban and Campbeltown festivals. The enthusiastic girls have developed enormously in the last nine months. It\u0026#8217s great to see such an active group of girls growing from around eight girls this time last year to nearly 20 now.The action continues with teams due to take part in Haldane and Lochnell festivals in September. For the year so far that’s over 200 kids\u0026#8217 days out in total with around 60 kids at the Oban festival and around 70 kids at the Campbeltown festival.With funding from Ardrishaig Community Trust and the Ventient Energy A\u0026#8217 Cruach Community Fund administered by Foundation Scotland it is hoped to increase the number of festivals kids can attend and to get more teams through to Lochgilphead.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"come on scotland","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/09/18, 5:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA healthy Mid Argyll support will be at Hampden this evening  to see Scotland take on face World Cup semi-finalists Belgium at Hampden Park.A bus load of 40 youngsters from Lochgilphead Soccer Centre headed off to Glasgow on Friday afternoon to cheer on Scotland in their friendly game.The match is a warm-up before the serious business begins on Monday September 10 as Scotland begin the inaugural Nations League at home to Albania.Here we go again.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC. He is also looking at doing the MSN circuit event in December at Knockhill.Donald and Paul also had a few close calls. On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby. He is now planning to have a break from competing for the rest of year to give the car a well deserved rest and some TLC.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"rocky start for mid argyll rfc in first round in scottish schools cup","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 11/09/18, 8:45 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe team scheduled to play Mid Argyll Rugby Club\u0026#8217s under 16s in the first round of the Scottish Schools Cup pulled out on the morning of the game \u0026#8211 but local school pupils saved the day.Duncanrig School should have played the Mid Argyll youngsters at Lochgilphead Joint Campus, but cancelled at the last minute.A team made up of Lochgilphead high, Tarbert Academy, Campbeltown Grammar and Islay high schools was quickly formed to play as South Argyll Schools  for this cup competition.Coach Lee Buckley said: ‘As the Islay school boys were already on the ferry over for the fixture, we decided to play a development game between the 22 SAS squad members at the joint campus.‘Everyone put in an amazing effort and this session could be key when the team plays Marr College in the second round of the cup.’The team also struggled to find a pitch to play another home game on recently as there are no suitable rugby pitches in Mid Argyll.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Having moved to Glasgow, Alison can no longer chair the group as a non-Argyll resident. She added that there is a degree of \u0026#8216committee fatigue\u0026#8217 among the group, while the computer equipment used by Autism Argyll is getting past its sell-by date.But the most signicant factor in ending Autism Argyll, said Alison, is a lack of support from senior management at Argyll and Bute Council over many years.She said: \u0026#8216Argyll and Bute has an agreed and published Autism Strategy, which the authority commissioned Scottish Autism to produce. There is also an implementation plan. However, neither is promoted and both are largely ignored.\u0026#8216The only time senior management appear to take any interest in those iniduals and families living with autism is  it they think it is going to cost the authority money.\u0026#8216At senior manager level, Argyll and Bute Council has rejected our knowledge, rebuffed our experiences, frustrated our efforts, sapped our enthusiasm, drained our goodwill and defeated us.\u0026#8217There is good news, however. Operating in Argyll and Bute with the support of Scottish Autism, the Get Set 4 Autism project provides online resources for professionals dealing with autism.Parents of recently diagnosed children also have access to an autism advisor and the Right Click online programme, helping to provide clear, timely and sensible information and support.Alison continued: \u0026#8216Autism Argyll has raised awareness, improved knowledge and understanding, and forged partnerships with iniduals and organisations such as Scottish Autism. We should be proud of our achievements.\u0026#8217Responding to the criticism, an Argyll and Bute Council spokesperson said: \u0026#8216We are saddened that Autism Argyll has been dissolved and we thank the organisation for its work down the years to educate the wider community on autism and to support people living with the condition.\u0026#8216We are working with our partners, including Cornerstone and Scottish Autism, on the development of residential resources in Garelochhead and Helensburgh, and also to improve services for people with autism across Argyll and Bute by way of introducing and implementing the Autism Toolbox.\u0026#8216Additionally, we have engaged with Autism Network Scotland for their assistance in further implementing our autism strategy, and these meetings will continue.\u0026#8217Responsibility for autism support also falls under the remit of Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership, and a spokesman confirmed that it had advertised for a new autism practitioner.He added: \u0026#8216We have been working closely with our partners to support those iniduals living in Argyll and Bute with autism and we have been exploring how we can build on the current services that are available. \u0026#8216PICS:Back to the beginning \u0026#8211 Autism Argyll is formed in 2000. no_a38AutismArgyll01Committee members past and present gather for the last-ever Autism Argyll AGM. 06_a38AutismArgyll03It was an emotional occasion for founder members Maureen MacIntosh, left, and chairwoman Alison Leask. 06_a38AutismArgyll02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"furnace shop and post office facing closure","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 21/09/18, 2:49 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowFurnace Village Store and Post Office is set to close at the end of the year unless someone can be found to carry on the business.The shop, with its three-bedroom bungalow behind, has been owned and managed by Mike and Syb Masters for the past 18 years.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn\u0026#8217t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry\u0026#8217s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say 10,000. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don\u0026#8217t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormous  of coastline. Scotland\u0026#8217s coast is about 18,500 kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate \u0026#8211 an enormously expensive system both in money and CO2 emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant \u0026#8211 it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September 21 is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are 90,000 people with dementia in Scotland and 1,982 people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

The handicaps are as tricky as juggling with hedgehogs  The novices keep you on your toes while the listed and the Group races have you tearing your hair out with the temptation to rip into the jolly regardless. Mind you, with just two favourites since 1980 winning the big race, perhaps we should be more confident. The Ayr Gold Cup is run over six furlongs and is open to horses aged three years or older with a maximum field size of 25. For those who like to follow trainers Richard Fahey and Andrew Balding have an excellent record in the race. They have, however, some way to go to match Yorkshire-based Irish man Kevin Ryan who has saddled four winners in the last 10 years. The pick of his entries  is MAJOR JUMBO 16/1. He comes good in September and the fast finishing second to KIMBERELLA last time out in a listed race at Chester is decent form. The current favourite has been punted hard having started the week at 8/1, and SON OF REST is now as short as 5s.  He put up his best performance yet when beaten a 1/2  by HAVANA GREY on Sunday at the Curragh. There is no guarantee that just six days on he can repeat the feat. I’m against him. Second favourite GROWL , in his career to date, has done all his winning earlier in the season and while soft ground would not be a hindrance most of his winning has come on faster turf. He’s not for me. Horses aged between four and fivr have an excellent record, but fillies and mares have yet to land a blow in the previous 16 renewals. The average winning starting price in that time was 15/1. Be bold, be brave you might say. A high draw is a bonus for this cavalry charge and with our selection MAJOR JUMBO drawn in stall 9 it should certainly not hinder this front runners chances. With 22 races under his belt, the horse has won five and been placed in 12 of the others. Those victories have come in a lower grade but MAJOR JUMBO 16/1 has acquitted himself well in Class 2 company. Apprentice jockey Finley Marsh claims a valuable 5lbs and though he is having only his second ride for trainer Ryan he is no stranger to the winners enclosure.

An early-morning police raid revealed Thomas Caldwell’s disgusting collection. The 35-year-old was caught with 18 Category A movies- showing the most vile type of child abuse. Ayr Sherf Court heard at an earlier hearing that Caldwell, of Kyle StreetAyr, immediately admitted that he ‘downloaded some stuff’. And he blurted out to officers “I don’t get a lot of girls”. Caldwell admitted being in possession of the indecent material between March 15 and November 6. And he faced his sentencing last Thursday for his heinous behaviour. Defence solicitor Tony Currie told Sherf John Montgomery: “He did everything to be compliant with the police process. “He’s a man who’s used pornography in the past and he’s unfortunately allowed it to stray on these occasions. “He lost his employment as a direct consequence because of this matter and he’s actually sourced alternative employment.”  The Sherf queried reference made in the reports to one 27-minute long video. Depute Fiscal Andrew Lazzarin replied: “That’s the one they’ve chosen to describe in detail.” Steering clear of putting Caldwell behind bars, the Sherf said: “Quite clearly any offence of this gravity well merits a custodial sentence. “But my  is to consider  custody is the only option. “And in your case, involving mitigating and aggravating factors in respect of your offence -I’ve come to the conclusion that the mitigating outweighs the aggravating, and therefore conclude that you could be dealt with by way of a community payback order. “You will be supervised in the community for three years and it will be a requirement that you will be part of the Moving Forward Making Changes programme. “You do not approach or speak to a child under the age of 16 unless approved from your supporting officer.” Caldwell was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work, and must not access the internet via computer or mobile phone.

A campaigner attended a meeting of Cumnock Community Council to get their support for the campaign. He said: “I was asked to get involved in a steering group in January to fight this. “I don’t think we can’t facilitate the amount of patients in Kilmarnock “We want to keep two open. “It is consultation period just now but we think that they are going to shut the one in Ayr. “We will be looking to host roadshows to the public. “In this area, cancer had affected a lot of the population. “Very few people in this area know about the proposals. “They want to take everything down to Crosshouse.” Cumnock Community Council agreed to support the campaign. One community councillor said: “I think we need to fight this. “We also need to think of people who live in the likes of Damellington and Patna.” And the campaigner said: “We will fight to keep it open. We want the support of community councils, MSPs and councillors to keep the facility in Ayr open.” A community councillor said: “We should write to our MP andMSPs. They should listen to us and we should write to them and ask them to come here. “We should fight to keep two of them open. We should be ploughing money into the two of them. We should be fighting for two of them.” A NHS Ayrshire and Arran spokeswoman said the future arrangements for Chemotherapy Services in Ayrshire and Arran remain under review. She added: “An important aspect of reviewing the service is to ensure that we can continue to deliver increasingly complex chemotherapy treatments to the highest standards possible, taking account of all relevant clinical evidence.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr HospitalCumnockAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"new ayrshire nursery gets thumbs","story":"NewsNew Ayrshire nursery gets the thumbs upHuge public support helped win permission for the building within the Heads of Ayr Farm Park.Share\u0026nbspByStephen Houston13:00, 24 SEP 2018NewsHeads of Ayr farm park nursery design \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new nursery is to be built surrounded by farmyard animals and cute critters. Huge public support helped win permission for the building within the Heads of Ayr Farm Park. And up to 20 jobs will be created. In a recent Ayrshire Post article celebrating 25 years of the farm park bosses Craig and Edna Rankin were excited about gaining approval for the nursery. They had suffered a blow as planning officials knocked it back in March on seven dferent policy points. But the couple’s architect Chris Stewart of Casa design in Ayr revealed: “Planning permission has now been granted for a new nursery school for up to 60 children. “It was approved on appeal on by the councillors on the Local Review Body.” Naturally the new nursery will have an outdoor theme. Edna said: “There is demand to get children back to nature and get outdoors. “There are so many new houses at Fisherton and Doonfoot and the area needs something. “Our own staff here cannot even find places to send their children.” Highly unusually, the plan had won universal support from the public with not one objection lodged with South Ayrshire Council. The application had been sent in earlier in 2017 but it was thrown out in December by council planners who were branded “very negative” by the architect. The site is currently a donkey pasture to the left of the farm steading and attractions and will include a new dedicated entrance from the A719 and car parking. The nursery will be built in the agricultural style with plenty of wooden cladding and some roof lights to mock a barn. The park attracts 180,000 people a year and has 90 staff. Director Greg Rankin said: “We were delighted to have planning for the Nursery granted by the Councils Local Review Board and I would like to thank them. “They were able to see the clear benefits that this project will bring to the area both for the local economy and local families . As well as all of the advantages to having a Nursery on site at Heads of Ayr Farm Park providing kids with the chance to learn and play in a safe outdoor environment. “Work on the Nursery starts shortly and we hope to have construction completed by Autumn next year. We are very excited to get started on its development and have been encouraged by lots of support from Locals and regular visitors of the Farm Park.” Casa Design architect Chris added: “It has taken two years to get to this stage, with ious consultations with the Planning Department and the Ayrshire Roads Alliance. The owners of the Farm Park have extensively researched this type of rural nursery, tied in with farm parks elsewhere in the UK and are very excited about the project. “It was very disappointing that the Planning Department decided to refuse the application in March this year on seven points which they construed as being contrary to the South Ayrshire Local Development Plan and Scottish Planning Policy. “We have found the Planning Department to be very negative with this application from the start. However, we are delighted that after an appeal, the councillors at the Local Review Body hearing this week saw the bigger picture and overturned their planners decision to refuse the application.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"pro wrestling elite stage stacked","story":"NewsPro Wrestling Elite to stage stacked card in Ayr as Kenny Williams defends Heavyweight TitleThe thrills and spills of PWE are ing to Ayr Town Hall tomorrow night with a packed card.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet15:16, 21 SEP 2018NewsPro Wrestling Elite champion Kenny Williams\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGrappling fans are in for a treat tomorrow as a host of wrestling stars will descend on Ayr.

Two more goals from Lawrence Shankland helped the Honest Men to victory at Alloa, putting them in prime shape for Wednesday\u0027s Betfred Cup trip to Ibrox. So what did we learn from this afternoon\u0027s display?   1. Shank You Very Much   Ayr fans are running out of superlatives for their star man and he delivered once again here. Lawrence Shankland arrived at Somerset Park 12 months ago with a reputation of unfulfilled talent - but it\u0027s safe to say he has long since put that record straight. Shankland is much more than a penalty box striker and he proved it again here with an all action display, leading from the front. His first goal - a clinical finish - underlined the class dference between these sides and Ayr rarely looked back. Most pleasing for United fans was the sight of Shankland berating teammates for a couple of loose passes as the clock ticked down in its final seconds. His desire and drive to raise standards is proving an example to all and with Shankland in their ranks, the sky could be the limit for Ayr.   2. Liam\u0027s A Touch Of Class   He was talked up as a quality signing and Liam Smith is proving the real deal. The Scotland under-21 full back has been deployed on the left during Daniel Harvie\u0027s suspension and, even though not his natural position, has looked a standout. Once again he offered Ayr real thrust here and was involved in most of their positive play. Boss Ian McCall has said he expects Smith to slot in at right back in the long term, but with such competition for places it is a nice problem to have.    3. Could Ayr Really Stun Rangers?   This was a workmanlike performance from United and they will need to raise their game signicantly to trouble Steven Gerrard\u0027s men on Wednesday night. But Ayr will rarely have the chance to go to Ibrox in better heart and in Shankland they have a genuine match winner who would not look out of place at the top of Scotland\u0027s Premiership. If they can hold their nerve and service the 15-goal striker, they may just cause a shock.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterRangers NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Rangers newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrScotland U21s football teamAyr United FCAlloa Athletic FCRangers FC"},{"url":null,"title":"double-delight-as-us-and-oz-come-together-at-st-boswells-live","story":"LATER this month St Boswells Live will be hosting a sublime event co-headlined between Aussie and resident Borderer Jenny Biddle, and USA west coast performer John Craigie.\nBoth of them are consummate songwriters and musicians, telling tales ranging from the heartbreaking to the outright hilarious, each in their own very dferent styles.\nIf Tracy Chapman married Joni Mitchell but then had a saucy love affair with Ani Dranco, you\u0026rsquod get Jenny Biddle.\nWith six albums under her belt and an iTunes chart-topping single, indie folk/blues songsmith, Jenny wraps herself around her guitar, and like a marriage between body and instrument, she commands her instrument to talk \u0026ldquowith uncommon skill and absolute self-assurance .\nHer audience is compelled to join her on a voyage of passion and story in song.\nAcoustic guitar-maker, proficient pianist, recovering chocoholic, and harmonica squawker, our Aussie singer is now based in sunny Scotland, touring internationally, and practising the art of making a woodstove fire with wet wood.\nFor this evening Jenny will be recording a live album which the audience will be a part of, something truly not to be missed.\nJenny explained why she relocated to the Scottish Borders: I\" moved over for love - the love of weather - actually I met my we four years ago while busking at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and moved to be here with her.\n\"We got married on the Eildons last year!\n\"My mother originated from Scotland as a ten-pound Pom - it\u0026rsquos interesting to come back to her roots.\"\nRecording a live album at her local village hall is something Jenny is excited about.\nShe explained: \"It\u0026rsquos time for a new album.\n\"I was impressed with Keith Farnish\u0026rsquos recordings from past gigs, and I like the idea of stripping my songs back and capturing the playfulness and spontaneity of a live show.\n\"St Boswells Live will make for a terric audience to singalong with and they\u0026rsquoll become backing singers for the album!\n\"I love engaging the audience and feed off it, even a bit of light heckling from them mixes things up.\n\"Once I had a lady crawl on the floor and bite me on the leg while performing in Melbourne \u0026ndash those kinds of audience members are less preferable.

fragments of a radiator from a zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal le and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to Oban but it\u0026#8217s an Argyll story,\u0026#8217 said Eleanor. \u0026#8216Major Struthers was actually based in Cornwall during the war.\u0026#8217Diana Manning, from Drumlemble but originally from Cornwall, attended the exhibition\u0026#8217s Campbeltown opening to find out more about the Cornish history, and found it \u0026#8216fascinating\u0026#8217.During her opening speech, Eleanor said: \u0026#8216I think this is an area of World War One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think they know the role they had in World War One.\u0026#8217Councillor Donald Kelly, who attended the opening, said he thought it was essential to engage with local school children: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s important that youngsters today know what went on in the past \u0026#8211 especially involving someone from Argyll.\u0026#8217The exhibition, which was launched in Oban in July, will be in Campbeltown until September 29, before moving on to Helensburgh and Dunoon.Councillor John Armour,

the HMS Platypus Cup became the club\u0026#8217s mixed doubles championship\u0026#8217s coveted trophy and names began to be inscribed.As with any weather dependent sport there were years when the championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924. In 1925 a christian name is inscribed for the first time, when, Bella Strang, taking her third win, was partnered by  Mr C. MacTaggart.Mrs W. McKersie and Mr C. McTaggart won in 1926 and Miss S.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.  A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.  With the help of neighbours and friends he remained at home until April, when his growing frailty led to him being admitted to Midlothian Community Hospital.  Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.  She added: \u0026ldquoDonald handled the Gospel with truth and diligence. His sermons were always topical, he was knowledgeable, articulate and had the ability to keep his hearers engaged.  \u0026ldquoHis ministry was inclusive. He made everyone welcome whether they came regularly or very occasionally, he was always encouraging and approachable.  \u0026ldquoHe procured a beautul organ built by George Holdrich in the late 1800s for a church in Appleby in the Lake District which was due to be scrapped.  \u0026ldquoDonald had it restored and installed in Musselburgh Congregational Church, where it continues to rouse worshippers today.  Mr Lindgren\u0026rsquos funeral at Musselburgh Congregational Church and Seafield Crematorium was well attended by the community of Musselburgh and Fisherrow.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.

Musselburgh resident Andrew Aitken decided to become a volunteer adviser a year and a half ago as, even although he works, he found he had some free time on his hands.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is interesting and is good  you can be of some use to people.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom at the CAB for half a day twice a week.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.  Since it opened, Torness has produced enough low-carbon electricity to save the equivalent of 84.8 million tonnes of CO2e  during its 30 years of operation, the same as taking all of the passenger cars off the UK\u0026rsquos roads for more than a year."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-womans-key-part-in-new-bbc-one-game-show-chase-the-case","story":"  The former Ross High School pupil plays a \u0026ldquofurious security guard in new strategy game Chase the Case, hosted by BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.

Lewis, of Dalkeith, is the current WTKA Scottish Champion, Sandee Open Intercontinental British Champion, Yokkao Open British Champion and SUSU Fighting Championship Champion. As a result, he is also British No. 1 and No. 2 in two weight isions.  Faith, of Tranent, is current Yokkao Scottish Champion, WTKA British Champion, Yokkao Open British K1 Champion, and Celtic Nations Champion and is ranked No. 2 in the UK.  In Italy, the duo will be competing to become both WTKA Muay Thai and K1 world champions.  Scott Hendry founded the club with friend Charles Cameron in 2014, and currently trains both Lewis and Faith.  \"Definitely, we could have two world champions coming back in November,\" he told the Courier.  \"They could come back with both titles which would be a tremendous achievement.\"  Faith\u0027s exploits are all the more impressive considering she has only been in the sport since May 2017.  \"Faith has been pretty remarkable,\" Scott said. \"She\u0027s had eleven fights in the space of a year.  \"She\u0027s won four titles and she\u0027s ranked number two in the UK.  \"She\u0027s fought the girl who is ranked number one four times and beat her three times.  \"I\u0027ve calculated it and she should move to number one by the end of the year.\"  The club, who train in the Bronx Boxing Gym in Tranent, will hold a fundraiser on Sunday.  He said: \"We\u0027re actually going to be fundraising in the gym.  \"We\u0027re inviting gyms from all over Scotland to come in and spar in the ring and it\u0027ll be \u0026pound3/4 on the door to come in.  \"All proceeds from that will go to the trip.

It was recognised as a provisional Olympic sport in 2016 meaning it will receive funding just under \u0026pound20,000 in annual funding from the International Olympic Committee.  The sport can then apply to become part of the Olympic games sports programme after three years.  Speaking about the championship and Olympic approval, Scott said: \"I think its good for the whole of the sport to be honest.  \"That\u0027s a huge thing for the sport, it should open up other avenues for the sport in terms of funding, as well as increase the profile of the sport.\"  There\u0027s definite potential for both Lewis and Faith to become Olympic athletes but Scott knows there is a long road ahead  both want to go pro.  \"Lewis is in a predicament because he\u0027s really good at football as well. He goes across to train in Glasgow every two weeks with the Scotland Youth Development squad.  \"So, there\u0027s a chance Lewis could go into pro football, teams have spoken to him. He\u0027s going to have a choice to make at some point.  \"With Faith, I think  it\u0027s done right she could make a career out of it.  \"There\u0027s avenues she could look at going down, but she\u0027s only 12 so there\u0027s a long way to go just yet.\"  The club has also recently been nominated three times in the Celebrating Sports Awards, held by East Lothian Council.  Put forward by Councillor and Provost John McMillan, they are shortlisted in three categories: Performance/Development Coach of the Year, Club or Community Coach of the Year, and Sports Club of the Year.

Mackintosh was a powerful advocate of Scottish devolution when that was an unpopular view in the Labour Party.

Only three more events remain, with the family\u0026rsquos initial target of \u0026pound1,000 smashed as nearly \u0026pound7,000 has been raised.

It has been a really positive thing for us.  \u0026ldquoYou just think the whole thing was completely ghastly and  something good can come out of it then that has got to be good.  \u0026ldquoIt is what Jenner wanted and I think she would be chuffed to bits about the money we have raised.  Also this weekend, Barry takes on the Belfast City Half Marathon.  The challenge ends in Glasgow next Sunday  when Elaine and Susan line up for the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon.  Susan, 61, thought that Sunday\u0026rsquos East Lothian run, which stretches from Musselburgh to Cockenzie and back, would be memorable.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only one on Jenner\u0026rsquos turf.  \u0026ldquoI think that will be a wee bit special.

Susan said: \u0026ldquoI think we have all found it emotional \u0026ndash just when you are standing on the start line waiting and we have had the odd laugh on the way round when something has happened.  \u0026ldquoIn Aberdeen we thought it was going to pour with rain and the forecast was dreadful. It rained a bit and then went off and we said it was Jenner sorting that out for us.

It aims to bring people together to create practical projects across the Dunbar and East Linton area that improve quality of le, support the local economy, and enhance the natural environment.  Mr Lancaster added: \u0026ldquoIf we can make it happen, it should be a win-win all round.  \u0026ldquoNot only will it be great for the people using the co-working centre, it will bring more people and more trade to High Street and boost the local economy.  \u0026ldquoA study we commissioned suggests it will add between \u0026pound600,000 and \u0026pound800,000 to the area each year.

In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"new-plans-for-the-future-of-scotlands-ferry-fleet-would-see-more-smaller-vessels","story":"  Crew members lined up at either end of the vessel as it docks in port, before throwing ropes over the side for colleagues ashore to tie up the vessel and allow passengers on and off.  But this could be consigned to history under radical plans to transform Scotland\u0026rsquos ferry network which are detailed in a blueprint which will go before MSP\u0026rsquos this week.  Under the proposals, the current model of serving island communities will be ripped up and instead will be based on the Norwegian system of smaller ferries covering shorter routes.  The move aims to increase capacity with more ferries and in some cases journeys being broken up using islands as \"land bridges\" to reduce journey times.  It would see islanders in the Outer Hebrides able to do business on the mainland in a day and  home without an overnight stay.  According to the expert behind it, it would also help repopulate islands as crew would live on the islands they serve rather than on board and staffing costs would be reduced.  Perhaps crucially, it would also dramatically reduce the annual subsidy paid to ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne to run the service.  The blueprint for the future of the network will go before Holyrood this week and comes as CalMac has been heavily criticised after a summer of disruption across the network due to breakdowns of the ageing fleet.  Transport expert Roy Pedersen, who spent 30 years in Highlands and Islands development, has submitted evidence which he says would radically reform the network and save the taxpayer millions of pounds in subsidies paid to CalMac.  According to the proposal, the current level of investment is well in excess of other countries but productivity is \u0026ldquoextremely poor and deteriorating.  Under his plan, a new fleet of around 10 smaller, more efficient ferries would be built with the total bill of around \u0026pound280 million. Upgrades to the ports they would serve will cost another \u0026pound20m.  Pedersen points out that Andrew Banks, owner of Pentland Ferries, is awaiting delivery of a new 100-car capacity ferry at a cost of \u0026pound14m, compared with \u0026pound50m-plus for the new hybrid green ferry MV Glen Sannox currently being built at Ferguson\u0027s.  One of the main points in the paper is reducing the number of staff required for each journey and ending the practice of ferry staff staying on board which adds to the operating costs.  Ferries would be crewed by a staff of around 12 to 14 as opposed to the 30-plus currently used.  This would allow staff to work shts similar to other operators and in Norway, and enable more ferries to run during the day and extend the timetable with services starting earlier and finishing later.  Staff would also live in the communities they serve which, it is argued, would help boost the populations of remote island communities as the smaller ferries would be based in the island ports and not on the mainland.  Pedersen said: \u0026ldquoThe alternative of crew living ashore on island communities served would contribute to the government\u0026rsquos objective of boosting island economies and reduce ship capital and operating costs.  \u0026ldquoFor the larger CalMac vessels it takes nine personnel to berth and cast-off a ship, this is done in Norway with just one hand due to efficient \u0026ldquolock-on linkspan design.  \u0026ldquoThus,  more cost-effective policies and practices along Scandinavian lines were adopted, much improved and higher capacity services could be provided for less public money.  Lock-on linkspans are already used in Scotland at the ports served by Western Ferries at Hunter\u0026rsquos Quay, near Gourock and on Shetland\u0026rsquos inter-island ferries.  Western Ferries carry more passengers and vehicles than the CalMac competition on the routes but receives no public subsidy. Each lock-on linkspan would cost around \u0026pound1.5m to install at each of the 10 large ports that CalMac would serve with the new ferries.  But while the installation costs of around \u0026pound15m seems expensive, the cost of the vessels themselves add another \u0026pound280m.  However, two new hybrid ferries being built to ease pressure on the network, the MV Glen Sannox and its sister ship, cost nearly \u0026pound100m. But the bill is set to be much higher as both are currently delayed until next summer at the earliest after hitting design problems at the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow which has heaped more pressure on the ageing fleet.  The delays come amid concerns that a recent signicant increase in traffic is causing severe problems for island communities. Tourism bosses on the Outer Hebrides have already warned the disruption has cost them millions of pounds this year.  Now CalMac\u0026rsquos own community board has condemned delays in new ferries and is demanding action. It was formed as part of CalMac\u0026rsquos successful franchise bid for the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Service in 2016.  At a recent meeting of the board in Mallaig, \u0026ldquodisappointment and frustration was reported from all parts of the network at the continuing delays in the delivery of the overdue vessels under construction, said chairman Angus Campbell.  He added: \u0026ldquoAt a meeting, also attended by CMAL and Transport Scotland, strong reservations were expressed at the apparent lack of a coherent long-term vessel replacement plan and the funding commitments necessary to provide both an improved fleet and the port improvements needed.  \u0026ldquoThe board feel they can work alongside the operator to help improve information quality and timing including maximising local knowledge.  \u0026ldquoThe communities board are keen to work positively with all parties to produce a more resilient and ambitious future for our ferry services resulting in better economic benefits for all that they serve but feel there is a real need for action now.  Critics say the current problems has been a generation in the making. Scotland\u0026rsquos islands are getting record numbers of visitors but the boats and port infrastructure carrying them are old and are struggling to cope.  The average age of a ship is 22 and in the early 1990s, the last time Scotland had a major burst of ferry-building with 7,000 tonnes worth in 1994 alone, the average age was just 12.  Between January and the end of July this year, 2,326 out of 79,203 CalMac scheduled sailings were cancelled. Of these, 327 were for mechanical reasons. Most of the rest were because of bad weather.  The figure for cancellations for problems with the ferries looks low, not least because CalMac will stress that it laid on more than 900 extra sailings to compensate for some of them.  But when a boat breaks down, a replacement has to come from somewhere else. Somebody always loses. CalMac does not have a spare vessel, crewed and fuelled ready to move in and act as relief.  Even  it did have a spare, CalMac could far from guarantee it could use it because every port is dferent, whether it be an ageing linkspan or unusual tide, making it dficult for ferries just to slot in.  However,  every port was fitted with the same locked-in linkspan and ferries were smaller and more versatile then they could be moved around the network more easily to cover any breakdowns, according to the blueprint.  The blueprint also outlines how routes could be shortened and slash journey times.  In Norway, ferries tend to travel between the shortest points across the water, with islands themselves being part of the journey.  Rather than go round the islands, ferries will dock at the nearest point, passengers will travel across the island by road, before picking up a ferry at the other side to continue the journey by sea.  Under the new proposal, Mull and Jura could play vital roles acting as these \u0026ldquoland bridges, slash journey times and increase service frequency to Islay and the Outer Hebrides.  Ferries would dock at Craignure on Mull as normal, but Barra passengers would travel on to Tobermory where they would pick up another ferry to continue the journey.  New terminals would also be built at Glendale on Skye to shorten the crossing to Lochmaddy on North Uist and another at Kilmoluaig to Tarbert on Harris.  Likewise, Islay passengers would get a ferry from Keills on the mainland and travel to Lagg on Jura, before crossing to Islay. One other advantage is that carbon emissions would be greatly reduced without the need for hybrid fuel ferries.  Pedersen added: \u0026ldquoBoth are much shorter than the current Kennacraig to Port Askaig/Port Ellen service on Islay and would allow up to ten daily crossings and the option of direct bus services between the islands and Glasgow.  Minister for Energy, Connectivity and the Islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: \u0026ldquoWe are continuing to invest in new vessels and ferry infrastructure to renew the fleet in accordance with the published Vessel Replacement and Deployment Plan. Over \u0026pound1 billion has been invested in ferry services across the Clyde and Hebrides routes, since 2007.  \u0026ldquoWork is also already under way to appraise, and subsequently to deliver on, further improvements to the ferry services to the Western Isles.  The majority of all visitors to the Outer Hebrides travel through Stornoway harbour, emphasising the importance of the CalMac ferry service to both the town and the wider islands.  The M.V Loch Seaforth, the biggest vessel in the CalMac fleet, sails between Ullapool and Stornoway three times a day, bringing with it up to 700 passengers, 143 cars or 20 commercial vehicles each time it arrives in Lewis.  Some 280,000 ferry passengers, 95,000 cars and 13,000 commercial vehicles a year come to Stornoway via the ferry.  Weekend crossings operate at full capacity and strong growth in tourism means that there are severe capacity constraints during the summer months.  Stornoway Port Authority, which has ambitious plans to develop the harbour as part of a 20-year Master Plan, is developing proposals to ensure the Port is able to accommodate the freight ferry which will likely be deployed to the route over the next few years.  Alex Macleod, the authority\u0026rsquos chief executive, said: \u0026ldquoThe existing ferry provides a good service which is an absolute leline for the community. But the risks in being dependent on a single vessel underline the need for additional capacity to cope with existing requirements and future needs.  \u0026ldquoThe projects we are developing in the Master Plan will help stimulate further economic growth but capacity limitations on ferries could have an impact on that potential growth.  \u0026ldquoThere will always be dficulties with ferry traffic in such a weather-affected part of the world, and as we have done for over 140 years, we will continue to work very closely with Calmac ferries to assist with the delivery of a robust and flexible service. Liaising closely with Calmac Ferries we will work together to find solutions for the good of the islands and everyone who uses these essential ferry services.  HebCelt relies heavily on CalMac ferry services to bring thousands of music fans to Lewis each summer.  The event is a huge economic driver for the islands, generating more than \u0026pound2 million a year and filling hotels, guest houses and campsites. Half the festival audience comes from outside the islands and the ferry route from Ullapool to Stornoway is the main gateway to the Outer Hebrides for these visitors.  HebCelt is also a catalyst for many island-hopping holidays with festival-goers using it as the start of a tour of Lewis, Harris, the Uists and Barra which also depend on CalMac services.  Such is the demand during HebCelt that ferry services have been extended in recent years around festival time to ensure fans are able to get to and from the islands.  Festival director Caroline Maclennan said: \u0026ldquoWe have a really close relationship with CalMac and appreciate many of the dficulties and challenges it faces.  \u0026ldquoCalMac is doing its best with an ageing fleet. The real conversation taking place just now is the frustration over the lack of investment in our leline services by successive governments.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos easy to criticise the service when things go wrong, but there are many sides to it.  \u0026ldquoWe have a very constructive dialogue with the company which helps us effectively address issues, not just those directly affecting ferry services, but also travel to ports and connecting services which can affect both regular travellers and visitors."},{"url":null,"title":"st-marys-music-school-ready-to-transform-old-royal-high-school-in-new-home-for-music","story":"  The future of the Old Royal High School is currently in the balance: currently two Scottish Government reporters are hearing evidence in an appeal from co-developers Duddingston House Properties and Urbanist Hotels.  They are appealing against the City of Edinburgh Council\u0027s decision to refuse planning permission for a luxury hotel on the site in August last year.  If the reporters reject the appeal, and Scottish Government ministers follow their advice, then St Mary\u0027s Music School says it is ready to take over the site.  : Paper sculpture aids music school campaign  The school, which has both planning permission and financial backing for their plan to turn the building into its new headquarters, said it would take around two years to transform the site.  Last week it launched a new campaign to get around 40,000 people to send a \"polite note\" to the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, a note which supports the music school plan.  Dr Kenneth Taylor, the headteacher of St Mary\u0026rsquos Music School, said: \"It\u0027s designed to let people know what although the inquiry is ongoing, there is actually a very exciting alternative.  \"And furthermore we have planning permission for these plans, the funding for these plans are in place - which in terms of a philanthropic gt to Scotland [from the Dunard Fund] is unparalleled in recent times.  \"It\u0027s an investment of \u0026pound35m, which is incredibly exciting - and we are ready to go.  \"We are just being held up by the appeal process - the Note campaign is designed to remind our supporters, remind the people of Edinburgh and to remind the politicians that we are here, and ready to go, and there is an alternative.\"  : New St Mary\u0027s Music School Campaign  The appeal process, currently taking place in Heart of Midlothian\u0027s Tynecastle Park stadium, is expected to last six weeks.  The reporters are expected to make their recommendations at the end of this year, or the beginning of 2019, and then Ministers decided whether they will uphold or reject the reporters\u0027 decision.  St Mary\u0027s Music School currently does not have the right to take over the building - it is understood the hotel developers have a deal with the council to develop the site, which expires in 2022.  Dr Taylor added: \"We could start tomorrow,  we were given the go-ahead, and we have been working closely with the architect - we have a great consensus around these plans from so many angles.\"  He said that the school\u0027s plans would open up their work to the community more, with concerts and an expanded education plan.  The Old Royal High School would also be used as a Edinburgh Festival venue.  It would have a public concert hall and garden, as well as new additions to the Thomas Hamilton-designed building.  : Music school seeks support for Old Royal High plan  The school said the new 280-seat concert hall could stage more than 100 public performances a year, attracting audiences of over 20,000 annually.  Dr Taylor added: \"We have been greatly heartened by the size and strength of the wonderful support we have already received from so many people in Edinburgh, as well as prominent figures in the arts and music community \u0026ndash Nicola Benedetti, Sir James MacMillan, Alexander Armstrong and Steven Osborne, to name just a few.  \"Moving to the Old Royal High School would give the school increased capacity, allowing us to offer a specialist music education to more young people of outstanding music ability.  \"Furthermore, we could open our doors to Edinburgh, Scotland and internationally with a whole range of new music activities.\""},{"url":null,"title":"lesley-laird-not-scheduled-to-speak-at-labour-party-conference-sources-confirm","story":"  The Shadow Cabinet minister has no set slot on the conference podium nor is she down to speak on the fringe programme.

The backbencher is due to contribute to the Labour for a Republic meeting on Tuesday evening, which will discuss why Labour \u0026ldquomust embrace Republicanism and work towards an end to the monarchy.  A Labour source, questioned why Ms Laird, who represents Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, was not speaking at conference, when normally in the past Shadow Scottish Secretaries have done so, said it was \u0026ldquoin no way unprecedented for the Shadow Secretary of State not to address the UK conference.  It is understood Ms Laird will be undertaking several roundtable discussions during the four-day event.  The source stressed how Richard Leonard would be speaking from the conference podium he will be giving the Scottish Report today during the afternoon plenary session. Yesterday, the Scottish Labour leader gave a keynote speech at the parallel World Transformed conference when he outlined the socialist case for Britain.  Jeremy Corbyn, who for the second year running spent a week during summer touring Scotland, has made clear winning more Scottish seats at the next General Election \u0026ldquoholds the key to Labour winning power.  The Labour leader is due to speak at the traditional Scots Night, which takes place this evening."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-leonard-backs-federal-britain-to-help-rebuild-scotland","story":"  In his address to the Labour conference, the Scottish party leader will suggest there is a growing \u0026ldquorestlessness for the redistribution of power for it to be held at a more local level, which would not only include giving greater powers to Holyrood but also to local government and the regions of England.  He is expected to tell delegates: \u0026ldquoA federal Britain, with greater powers for the Scottish Parliament, is the radical solution that I want to see.  \u0026ldquoWe need new powers to reflect the new realities of Brexit, which is why there is a Labour guarantee that devolved powers ing from the European Union will be transferred to the devolved governments and that we will enter a new era of co-determination in a new era of democratic politics.  \u0026ldquoOur task is to reinvigorate politics. It is to build up our movement for democracy and socialism.  A federal Britain is usually seen as Westminster retaining powers over foreign and defence policy as well as UKwide taxes but devolving everything else to parliaments in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England.  However, Mr Leonard\u0026rsquos argument to give greater powers to Edinburgh under a federal system could be seen at odds with his contention yesterday not to allow a second Scottish independence referendum.  Some could argue that creating a federal UK would mean handing over more constitutional powers to the Scottish Parliament, including the ability to hold a referendum on Scotland\u0026rsquos future.  Mr Leonard\u0026rsquos predecessor Kezia Dugdale backed the creation of a federal UK under a new Act of Union. However, Jeremy Corbyn was regarded as being cool on the idea.  Yet in the Labour Party manesto for the 2017 General Election the party promised to establish a constitutional convention  it gained power, which would \u0026ldquolook at extending democracy locally, regionally and nationally, considering the option of a more federalised country.  In January, Lesley Laird, the Shadow Scottish Secretary, also distanced herself from the push for federalism, describing it as an \u0026ldquounhelpful label. She appeared to downplay the prospect that a federal UK would be the final outcome of the planned constitutional convention under a Corbyn premiership.  Asked about federalism, a concept backed by her predecessor as Kirkcaldy MP, Gordon Brown, Ms Laird said: \u0026ldquoThat labelling is unhelpful because  you say to people, \u0026lsquowhat\u0026rsquos federalism?\u0026rsquo they will think about Germany, for example.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos about what appeals to people and a more simple, straightforward way to think about that is to have powers where they most logically sit, where the best decisions can be taken.  In his conference speech today Mr Leonard will also make clear the next UK manesto will include a commitment to oppose a second Scottish independence referendum.  The Scottish Labour leader will tell delegates Scotland does not need another independence referendum rather, it needs a radical UK Labour government.  However, it is still unclear  a future Labour government, while opposing so-called Indyref2, would agree to facilitate one. Last week, Mr Corbyn said he would \u0026ldquonot rule out approving a second vote on Scotland\u0026rsquos future.  Last year, after Holyrood mandated Nicola Sturgeon to call for another independence referendum, the UK party leader made clear it should not be up to Westminster to go against a democratic vote in the Scottish Parliament.  Responding to Mr Leonard\u0026rsquos declaration that Labour would oppose Indyref2, the First Minister tweeted that Labour\u0026rsquos attempt to \u0026ldquoout Tory the Tories on #Indy shows no sign of abating.

Any move by the Labour leadership to directly back the so-called People\u0026rsquos Vote \u0026ndash the supporters of which say it should include the option of staying in the EU - would be a reversal of policy, which is simply to keep it on the table.  It would also be a landmark decision in the Brexit process as it would align Labour not only with the People\u0026rsquos Vote campaign itself but also the Liberal Democrats.  Mr Corbyn said he was \u0026ldquobound by the democracy of our party but also noted: \u0026ldquoLet\u0027s see what comes out of conference.  His deputy Tom Watson also made clear  party members voted to back a People\u0026rsquos Vote, he would support the move.  \"Jeremy and I were elected in 2015 to give the Labour Party back to its members. So,  the people\u0027s party decide they want the people to have a final say on the deal, we have to respect the view of our members and we will go out and argue for it,\" he said.  Last night, around 100 Labour delegates were engaged in intense discussions behind closed doors deciding on the key issue of the wording of the Brexit motion to be debated and voted upon.  Earlier, the Labour leader, while he made clear he would support the will of the party  its members decided to back a People\u0026rsquos Vote, stressed he personally believed a general election would be a better way to resolve the political crisis over the nature of the UK\u0027s departure from the EU.  And Len McCluskey, the Unite leader, warned that any second vote on Brexit should not be asking  the public wanted to stay in the EU as proposed by those supporting a People\u0026rsquos Vote.  \"We have already had a People\u0027s Vote they voted to come out of the EU,\" declared Mr McCluskey.  At a fringe event last night, he warned: \"We have to be careful about how we play with our democracy.\"  Highlighting the tensions at the top of the party, Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Shadow Business Secretary, admitted to having \"reservations\" about backing another vote because, she argued, the Conservative Government \"might be able to skew it in particular directions to secure the result they wanted\".  The Labour leadership, which has always said it respected the 2016 referendum result, is fearful that any open support for a second EU vote, which included the option of reversing that decision, would alienate a swathe of Labour voters, who backed Brexit.  The position of the leadership has been made dficult after a poll found 86 per cent of Labour members thought voters should have the final say on the outcome of Brexit negotiations and 90 per cent said they would now vote to remain in the EU.  Yesterday in Liverpool, thousands of people, including MPs, MEPs, trade union leaders and activists marched through the city and attended a rally, calling for a People\u0026rsquos Vote.  As he addressed the gathering Labour MP David Lammy said: \"Are you listening Jeremy Corbyn?\"  Highlighting how people from across the UK were present, the Tottenham MP said: \"They are saying squarely to the leadership of the Labour Party: \u0027Listen to us, hear us, give us a People\u0027s Vote.\u0027  \"When we have that People\u0027s Vote let us ensure that the option to remain in the EU is on the ballot paper,\" he declared.  A crowd waving EU and other flags chanted \"b*****ks to Brexit\" and \"it\u0027s not a done deal\" as they walked from St George\u0027s Hall in the city centre to the rally at Pier Head, close to where the conference is taking place.  Manuel Cortes, the General Secretary of the TSSA transport union, also backed calls for Labour to support a second referendum on Brexit.  \"The terms of Brexit should be put to the British people,\" he declared, adding: \u0026ldquoPeople voted to leave the European Union but that doesn\u0027t mean buying a pig in the poke or giving the Prime Minister a blank cheque. Whatever she negotiates she needs to bring back to the British people.\"  Last night at a rally at the World Transformed Festival, running alongside the conference, Mr Corbyn said the rich were on \"borrowed time\" as he took aim at their tax breaks and offshore havens.  After receiving a rapturous reception, he told the audience the \"poorest and most vulnerable\" had been forced to pay the price for the 2008 financial crash.  The Labour leader said that winning an election was \"not going to be easy\" but hailed the power of \"popular movements coming together\".  Stressing how challenging neoliberal economics was \u0026ldquofundamental to what we believe in,\" Mr Corbyn added: \"Austerity has been meted out on the poorest and most vulnerable people in our society.  \"They are the ones who paid the price of the banking crisis of 2008, all the time the very richest in our society have had tax breaks, giveaways and tax havens.  \"I tell you what: they are on borrowed time because a Labour government is coming.\""},{"url":null,"title":"marianne-taylor-jeremy-corbyn-has-one-last-chance-to-do-the-right-thing-over-brexit","story":"  At the other end of the political spectrum Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters have descended upon Liverpool for surely the most important Labour conference in a generation.

Yesterday, Mr Corbyn grudgingly conceded he would back the so-called People\u0026rsquos Vote  his membership absolutely insists upon it, arguing that a general election is the answer to the country\u0026rsquos currently problems.  Meanwhile, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said over the weekend that Labour would push ahead with Brexit  it won a snap election, insisting his party would somehow miraculously get a much better deal from the EU than the Tories, despite also having ruled out staying in the single market. Does he honestly believe Brussels will look more favourably on Labour rejecting fundamental EU principles such as free movement than the Tories? Didn\u0026rsquot he see President Macron\u0026rsquos two-fingered reaction to Mrs May\u0026rsquos rhetoric last week?  It is simply not credible for Labour to fight a general election on a manesto that favours ploughing ahead with a similarly destructive Brexit when a poll would only be necessary because the Conservatives had failed to agree a plan.  Mr McDonnell also claimed during an interview that pulling back from Brexit could result in xenophobia. What planet is he living on? Can\u0026rsquot he see that leaving the EU hands victory on a plate to the xenophobes?  A recent tweet by his shadow cabinet colleague Barry Gardiner revealed just how twisted the logic of the party leadership has become. When asked by a despairing Labour activist why the current Brexit chaos elicited only silence from Labour, Mr Gardiner replied: \u0026ldquoNever interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.  The idea that keeping your mouth shout and failing to make a credible alternative case, either for a soft Brexit or no Brexit at all, makes you a suitable and trustworthy opposition when the country is heading for utter disaster is either naive, arrogant or stupid - most likely all three.  Despite continual obfuscation, it\u0026rsquos crystal clear that Mr Corbyn and his deputy are as Eurosceptic as many of the Tories they have spent their lives opposing. In light of this, perhaps Mr Gardiner\u0026rsquos tweet should more accurately have stated: \u0026ldquoNever interrupt your enemy when he is saying something you agree with, but don\u0026rsquot have the guts to admit to.  I\u0026rsquom not suggesting Mr Corbyn should not be allowed to oppose Britain\u0026rsquos EU membership. What I\u0026rsquom saying is that he should have been honest about it from the start. As a potential prime minister, however, he must also be able to let go of personal principles, no matter how deeply and honestly held, when the good of the country is at stake. As we have seen regularly since his election, however - most recently during the antisemitism debacle - compromise is not something that comes easy to this dogmatic old Leftie.  We must hope, therefore, that the party membership, many of whom are young people who oppose Brexit, can force common sense upon the leadership. There is overwhelming support there for a second referendum, with one recent poll suggesting 85 per cent want a say on the outcome of negotiations, with an even higher proportion in favour staying in the EU.  There would potentially be a signicant electoral boost in adopting the People\u0026rsquos Vote, at last giving Labour a strong, distinctive and viable policy that people from across the UK - including Scotland - could get behind. And an electoral lt is exactly what the party needs despite taking the country to the edge of the abyss, the Tories remain ahead in the polls.  Mr Corbyn now has one final opportunity to redeem himself and put country before conviction. We must hope he has the sense and humility to take it."},{"url":null,"title":"non-religious-pupils-could-be-excluded-from-nativity-plays","story":"  The attack comes after the Church said such pupils would face wider exclusion from \"charitable fundraising, Nativity plays and feast day celebrations\".  Officials from the Humanist Society Scotland and Secular Scotland said denominational schools could even face legal action  they followed the advice.  Earlier this month First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government intended to incorporate the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child into Scots Law.  The a move is signicant because the UN\u0027s Children\u0027s Rights Committee recommended the current right of parents in Scotland to opt out of religious observance should be extended to pupils.  Responding to the suggestion a spokesman for the Catholic Church said: \"Current guidance, allowing pupils to express their views on religious observance, allows them to be given an explanation of the advantages of religious education and religious observance, following which many pupils continue to attend.\"  The spokesman said schools would organise \"purposeful work\" for those pupils who still wanted to opt out.  But he added: \"Parents and pupils who wish to opt out on grounds of conscience are advised that, in order not to contradict their wishes, schools will ensure they are not part of any other religious education and religious observance activities such as religiously-motivated charitable fundraising, Nativity play or feast day celebrations. Very few wish to be excluded in this way from the le of the school.\"  The statement provoked an angry backlash from Gordon MacRae, chief executive of the Scottish Humanist Society, who described it as \u0026ldquodisturbing.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis suggests denominational schools coerce or threaten to isolate children and young people from the school community because of their faith or belief.  \"Following such a course of action would put denominational school headteachers in potentially actionable situations and completely distract them from the professional work they do educating pupils and running inclusive school environments.  \"All schools in Scotland, including denominational ones, have a responsibility under law to respect and uphold the independent human right to freedom of religion and belief.\"  Robert Canning, chair of Secular Scotland, added: \u0026ldquoWe would not agree that children opted out of religious observance, by themselves or their parents, should automatically be excluded from all activities connected with religion, since not all such activities involve worship or prayer.  \"Children acting in Nativity plays are obviously expressing the outlook of the characters and not their own beliefs, and a child might want to be part of a fundraising effort without having the religious motivation that other participants might claim.\"  Professor Paul Braterman, from the Scottish Secular Society, said: \"Parents and pupils should be allowed to decide for themselves regarding matters such as Nativity plays and Feast Day celebrations, on a case-by-case basis.  Meanwhile, teaching unions welcomed the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos intention to incorporate the UN\u0027s convention on children\u0027s rights into Scots Law.  A spokesman for the Educational Institute of Scotland said the union would support the right of children, at a suitable point in their development, to be able to withdraw from religious assemblies  they wished.  He added: \"We would support children at a suitable point in their development having the right to withdraw  they wish and note that Scottish Government guidance makes it clear that in no circumstances should a pupil be disadvantaged as a result of withdrawing from religious observance.  \"Under the terms of the Equality Act, schools have a legal duty to prevent discrimination against those who hold particular religious or philosophical beliefs and to actively ensure that they have equal opportunity to participate in the le of the school.  \"To actively exclude children from activities which may be religion-related, but which would not be classied as religious observance, is likely to invite strong legal challenge.\"  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"The existing statutory guidance recognises that when a parent chooses a denominational school ... there is an expectation that they have opted into the school\u0026rsquos ethos and practice including activities relating to religious faith and observance.  \"Our guidance also states no pupil should be disadvantaged as a result of withdrawal from religious observance.\"  In Scotland, all young people require parental permission to pull out of religious observance, unlike England and Wales where sixth form pupils \u0026ndash typically aged between 16 and 18 \u0026ndash have the right to opt out.  The law which governs religious observance, originally dating from 1872, has not been updated since 1980 and the latest guidance from the Scottish Government was issued in 2011.  The guidance states: \"Where a parent chooses a denominational school for their child\u0026rsquos education, they choose to opt in to the school\u0026rsquos ethos and practice which is imbued with religious faith and religious observance.  \"In denominational schools, it is therefore more dficult to extricate a pupil from all experiences which are influenced by the school\u0026rsquos faith character.  \"Where a pupil is withdrawn from religious observance schools should make suitable arrangements for the pupil to participate in a worthwhile alternative activity. In no circumstances should a pupil be disadvantaged as a result of withdrawing from religious observance.\""},{"url":null,"title":"john-mcdonnell-says-any-peoples-vote-should-not-include-option-of-britain-staying-in-eu","story":"  Pro-EU activists\u0027 hopes of the party fully throwing its weight behind a People\u0026rsquos Vote suffered a major setback at Labour\u0027s conference in Liverpool.  More than 100 constituency parties submitted motions demanding a second referendum and thousands of people joined a march calling for a so-called People\u0027s Vote in order to put pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to change course.  But, as expected, after a marathon \u0026ldquocompositing session on Sunday night, the exact wording of the motion to be put to a vote at the party\u0027s conference tomorrow states only that \" we cannot get a general election, Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote\".  This is effectively a restatement of the leadership\u0026rsquos position.  However, John McDonnell, a key ally of the party leader, went further this morning by making clear that  there were any second referendum, it should be on whether or not to accept a Brexit deal or conduct fresh negotiations with Brussels rather than seek to reverse the 2016 decision to leave the EU.  The Shadow Chancellor explained: \"We argued for Remain in the past but we lost that vote so we have to respect that. All the polling that we have seen is that the country is still pretty split down the middle.  \u0026ldquoMy big worry is that  we go for a referendum which is seen as just a simple re-run we could ide the country again, we could get almost the same result or  it\u0027s slightly dferent that people demand another referendum.\"  He noted how the 2016 poll \"opened up all sorts of xenophobic feelings and a rise of the Right\" and stressed: \"I don\u0027t want to revive Ukip in any way or even the far Right\".  The precise wording of the referendum question would be a matter for Parliament, Mr McDonnell pointed out, telling BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \"If we are going to respect the referendum, it[a People\u0027s Vote] will be about the deal.\"  On Good Morning Britain he suggested that a general election would be \"the real People\u0027s Vote\" because it would give the public the chance to change the team carrying out the negotiations, replacing Theresa May with a Labour government.  But he acknowledged the debate at the conference \"may be rumbustious\".  Labour MP David Lammy, a prominent campaigner for a second referendum, was not best pleased, saying it would be \"farcical\" to have a vote without the option of remaining in the EU.  \"A People\u0027s Vote is the only realistic option to save this country from the car crash of Brexit, declared the London MP.  \"No Tory or DUP MP is likely to vote for a general election. Turkeys do not tend to vote for Christmas.\"  He added: \"We\u0027ve now got to turn up the noise until we secure a public vote which gives us the option to remain in the UK.\"  Mr Lammy received support from his Labour colleague and fellow Remainer Chuka Umunna, who called for an \"unequivocal\" commitment to a second referendum with remaining in the EU as an option.  Tom Brake for the Liberal Democrats said, by ruling out the option of Britain staying in the EU in a second referendum, the Labour leadership was aiding and abetting Theresa May on Brexit.  \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquove spent two years backing the Tories\u0026rsquo catastrophic Brexit and are even now trying to ignore their own members who want a People\u0026rsquos Vote with the option to remain in the EU.  \u0026ldquoIt beggars belief that McDonnell and Co are spending so much time trying to trick and stitch up their own conference rather than campaigning for an exit from Brexit to protect jobs and services in the UK.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe only choice a \u0026lsquodeal or no deal\u0026rsquo vote gives people is which foot to point the gun at. Liberal Democrats demand better than Brexit and want to give the people the final say on any deal through a People\u0027s Vote where they will have the option to remain in the EU.  Eloise Todd of pro-EU Best for Britain said it would be \"unthinkable\" for a second vote not to include the option of Britain staying in the EU and was \"not what the 90 per cent of Labour members who back a public vote would expect\".  She added: \"Labour must listen to its members on this and the vast majority of its voters. It\u0026rsquos time for a final say with the option to stay.\""},{"url":null,"title":"john-mcdonnell-denies-workers-shareholding-plan-would-lead-to-less-investment","story":"  The Shadow Chancellor took to the airwaves to promote Labour\u0026rsquos new plan, saying: \"If you look at other economies, like Germany, where there\u0027s been much more worker involvement, it\u0027s been the reverse.  \"You get more investment, you get longer-term decision-making and you have a growing economy. This is nothing unusual. It happens in other countries and it has proved to be successful.\"  But Carolyn Fairburn, the CBI Director-General, said Labour\u0027s plans would hit share prices and cause investment to \"flee\" the country.  She told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \"Take steps like this and we will set the clock back, investment will flee our country and, whatever Labour say about this, the outcome will be one that reduces pay in people\u0027s pockets.\"  Meanwhile, Mr McDonnell said Jeremy Corbyn should be succeeded by a woman. Conference is expected to back a rule change to create having a female deputy leader to work alongside the current deputy Tom Watson, leading to speculation that when Mr Corbyn stands down, he will be succeeded by a woman.  The Shadow Chancellor told Today: \"The next leader of the Labour party has to be a woman.\"  Changes to rules governing leadership elections and selection of MP candidates have been approved at conference.  Members and unions voted 63.94 per cent for and 36.06 per cent against the changes to the leadership rules and 65.32 per cent for and 34.68 per cent against the changes to selection of MP candidates.  Under the reselection rule change, the threshold to force sitting MPs to fight open selection battles will be cut from 50 to 33 per cent of local branches or affiliated unions.  Labour MPs currently face a so-called \"trigger ballot\" before each general election but must fight against other contenders for the candidacy only  a majority of local branches and affiliated unions back an open selection contest.  The new change will require an open contest  either 33 per cent of local party branches or 33 per cent of affiliated trade union branches demand one.  The rule change for future leadership contests does not alter the 10 per cent threshold for the number of MPs\u0027 nominations which a candidate must gather to get on to the ballot paper but also requires would-be leaders to secure nominations from fiver per cent of constituency parties or five per cent of members of trade unions or affiliated organisations."},{"url":null,"title":"sketch-bring-it-on-red-john-pushes-all-the-socialist-buttons","story":"  As John McDonnell went through his conference ritual of pressing every Socialist button he could find, my neighbour, miraculously, received an electric shock each time and jumped up enthusiastically.

Remember this was the one which Tony B changed to entrench New Labour\u0026rsquos commitment to economic dynamism.  \u0026ldquoI say the Clause 4 principles are as relevant today as they were back then, declared Red John. Comrade X shouted: \u0026ldquoYes, yes, yes, and clapped loudly.  The Shadow Chancellor praised the Archbishop of Canterbury - not an everyday occurrence - who got into a spot of bother after calling zero hours contracts \u0026ldquoevil it emerged some Anglican churches were advertising the very same.  Justin Welby got it in the neck from the right-wing press but Red John had some soothing words for the archbish: \u0026ldquoWhen they get round to calling you a Marxist, I\u0026rsquoll give you some tips on how to handle it.  Next up was giving workers a shareholding in their companies and the creation of a social idend to help fund public services. Comrade X hollered his support.  Then came the N-word the nationalisation of water, energy, the Royal Mail and the railways. My neighbour was by now jumping up and down with delight.  After hitting out at the banking fat cats, it was onto Brexit and the chance for Red John to send an electric shock throughout the entire conference hall.  Noting how he was not going to lower expectations, the wannabe Chancellor declared to a wave of applause: \u0026ldquoThe greater the mess we inherit, the more radical we have to be. By now Comrade X needed a glass of water.  But the peak of my neighbour\u0026rsquos enthusiasm was about to be hit when the Labour chief mentioned how the Tories were supposedly drawing up secret plans for a quick general election. \u0026ldquoSo, the message from this conference is, declared Red John: \u0026ldquobring it on!  The electric current shot out from the podium and Comrade X punched the air repeatedly as the conference hall erupted.  After visiting Anfield at the weekend, it was perhaps inevitable that Red John, the son of a Liverpool docker, would go one step further and quote the footballing legend Bill Shankly.  He declared: \u0026ldquoWhenever the General Election comes, we are ready. Ready to campaign for victory, ready for Government, ready to build the future.

If passed, the Bill would flip the current system in towns and cities, where the default limit is generally 30mph, but councils can apply to restrict it to 20mph in specic areas.  Under the proposal, the default limit would instead become 20mph, and councils would have to apply to make it 30mph.  The change would affect the C-class and unclassied local roads which make up around 60 per cent of all UK highways, but not arterial A and B class roads.  The idea has the support of around two dozen MSPs from all the parties at Holyrood bar the Tories, as well as support from the leaders of Glasgow and Edinburgh city councils.  The Scottish Government has not endorsed it, saying it believes councils are best placed to decide speed limits on the local roads they oversee, but will now examine more evidence.  The Bill documents say the expected costs to councils, principally signage, would be around \u0026pound22m, based on previous small-scale roll-outs.  However a 10% fall in accidents could save the public purse close to \u0026pound40m in police, NHS and economic costs, and previous trials have seen a 20% fall in accidents and fatalities.  People are seven times less likely to die  hit by a vehicle travelling at 20 rather than 30mph.  Campaigners for the change also say it would help reduce pollution and encourage more people to walk and cycle, because they would feel less threatened by traffic speeds.  Mr Ruskell said that  the Bill received strong support at Holyrood is could become law by the end of 2019, then phased in after a further 18 months.  He said: \"As a local councillor and as an MSP I have seen first-hand the frustration of communities that want lower speed limits but find the current process overly-complicated.  \u0026ldquoBy making 20 the norm in built-up areas we can end this frustration and provide the clarity that residents and motorists deserve.  Mark Beaumont, who became the fastest round-the-world cyclist by cycling 18,000 miles in under 79 days, said: \"It\u0027s great to see Mark Ruskell\u0027s bill in the Scottish Parliament helping build the momentum on this issue and I hope we see it become law in the near future. This is about saving lives, reducing injuries and improving public health and enjoyment by making our streets safer and healthier places to cycle and walk.  \u0026ldquoThe current system of patchwork 20mph zones is time-consuming and costly for local councils, and confusing for road users. Scotland has a real chance to take a lead on this so let\u0026rsquos go for it.  Emilia Hanna of Friends of the Earth Scotland said: \u0026ldquo20mph zones make our streets safer and fairer for everyone using them, and are a vital part of the solution to air pollution.  \u0026ldquoThe faster people drive, the greater the risk of accidents, and the more off-putting it is for people to walk and cycle. Cars dominate our streets far too much already.  \u0026ldquoThere needs to be a much more level playing field between pedestrians, cyclists, public transport users and drivers. Slowing traffic is a key way to achieve this.  But Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said: \u0026ldquoTo take drivers along with them the authorities need to explain not only what they are doing to improve safety but also how the changes will make people\u0026rsquos journeys smoother and more reliable.  \u0026ldquoThere will be many urban roads in Scotland where, given the congestion, drivers couldn\u0026rsquot get up to 20 mph even  they were allowed to.  from Neil Grieg, Director of Policy and Research at IAM Roadsmart, said: \u0026ldquoAll roads dfer in their form and  at a very detailed level and the limit should reflect that.  \u0026ldquoThis is why IAM RoadSmart does not favour a blanket approach to speed limits or a wholesale change in the urban limit from 30 to 20.  \u0026ldquoIf you want to change driver behaviour you need to spend more and change the character of the road. That means more high quality surfacing and shared space. Drivers will get the message and share the road even more safely than they do already.  A spokesperson for government quango Transport Scotland said: \u0026ldquoWe are clear that 20 mile per hour speed limits are a good idea when implemented in the right environment.  \u0026ldquoGiven the ied nature of Scotland\u0027s urban road network and the number of factors which need considered when setting appropriate limits, we believe decisions on 20 mph speed limits are best taken at the local authority level.  \u0026ldquoThe Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity met with Mark Ruskell MSP regarding his plans to bring forward a Member\u0026rsquos Bill on 20 mph speed limits and we look forward to seeing the detail of any legislative proposals submitted to Parliament."},{"url":null,"title":"worker-sacked-after-crackdown-on-duty-free-goods","story":"  Bruce Mackie worked for a bonded warehouse in Aberdeen, delivering duty-free goods to boats sailing out of Peterhead, Fraserburgh and Macduff harbours.  However, officials clamped down on sales in January this year after it emerged not all of the vessels were entitled to the cheap supplies - meaning his employers suffered a 50 per cent drop in business.  Mr Mackie, from Stonehaven, was forced to resign when bosses at Butlers Ship Stores Ltd cut his hours and pay in half.  He has now won his case for constructive and unfair dismissal at an employment tribunal.  Employment judge Alexander Kemp said: \"Whilst they are a very small company, and faced a particularly challenging set of circumstances with the changes to their business... I consider that in all the circumstances there was an unfair dismissal.\"  Under HMRC guidelines, bonded  goods can be sold to fishing vessels sailing to destinations outwith a designated area.  However, officials discovered that not all of the boats buying the cheap alcohol and tobacco were travelling to those areas.  A written judgment on the case states: \"Fishing vessels which were supplied by the firm required to sail north of latitude 61 degrees in order to qualy for duty free.  \"Technological advances and other changes allowed HMRC to track vessels\u0027 movements, and it became clear to HMRC that some vessels did not sail north of that line, and thus were not entitled to receive bonded goods free of duty, but had been doing so.\"  The judgment adds: \"HMRC began to enforce the provisions more strictly particularly from December 2017 and let that be known to the fishing community.  \"Fishing vessels which did not sail north of the 61 degrees north line of latitude were informed that  they received bonded goods to which they were not entitled, they would be subject to enforcement action by HMRC.\"  Officials visited Butlers Ship Stores in January and explained that many of the boats supplied by the firm were no longer entitled to duty free.  As a result of the crackdown, the company experienced a drastic drop in orders, with turnover failing from an average of \u0026pound119,000 per month to just over \u0026pound55,000 per month.  In February, Mr Mackie was called in by his bosses and told that the downturn meant there was not enough work to employ a driver full time.  They cut his hours from 40 to 20 per week and halved his salary.  The driver resigned soon after, claiming the company had breached his contract.  Judge Kemp ruled that the company should have treated Mr Mackie\u0027s situation as a redundancy and given notice and consultation as appropriate.  However, because they did not so this, the worker was constructively and unfairly dismissed.

The journal found that golf is good for both the mind and body, and can help lead to a longer le for both men and women as playing a round regularly can reduce the risk factors for heart disease and stroke.  A report by the journal\u0027s panel of experts on the benefits of the sport found that it can provide moderate intensity aerobic physical activity and boost older people\u0027s strength and balance.  They also said the game is associated with good mental health and improving the overall health of those with disabilities, and compared with other sports the risk of injury is moderate.  Golf is also sociable and gets people outdoors, connecting them with nature.  However, while around 60 million people play golf at least twice a year, the panel acknowledged the participant profile remains quite narrow.  Players tend to be middle aged to older, male, of white European heritage, relatively well off, and living in North America, Europe and Australasia.

It has also made a raft of recommendations to guide policy-makers and industry leaders on how to make golf more inclusive and accessible and encourage more people from all walks of le to take it up.  The panel suggests golfers should aim to play for 150 minutes a week and walk the course rather than ride in a golf cart.  It also urges the industry to develop a culture that will inspire more women and girls to play, as well as promote equality and ersity.  \"These outputs,  widely shared and adopted, will contribute to an improved understanding of golf and health, and aid these groups in making evidence-informed decisions and to improve health and wellbeing,\" the panel said."},{"url":null,"title":"cancellations-and-delays-for-ferry-commuters","story":"  Five services within the CalMac network had to be cancelled due to technical dficulties, with two ferries declared out of action.

Mr McDonnell\u0026rsquos comments sparked concern among People\u0026rsquos Vote supporters who staged a march and rally in Liverpool on the conference\u0026rsquos opening day.  Labour MP David Lammy, a prominent campaigner for a second referendum, said it would be \u0026ldquofarcical to have a vote without the option of remaining in the EU.  Speaking on behalf of the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, his colleague Ian Murray said: \u0026ldquoIt would be absolutely ridiculous to ask people to choose between a bad deal and a worse deal without the option of rejecting Brexit.  The Edinburgh MP added: \u0026ldquoThe shadow cabinet needs to get its act together and listen to the vast majority of Labour members who want a People\u0026rsquos Vote. The country is watching.  Sir Keir later said that the option of ditching EU withdrawal had not been ruled out. The meeting last night was very clear that the question of a public vote should be open.  \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot ruling out options and nobody was ruling out Remain. There were 300 people in the room and that was absolutely clear.  More than 100 constituency parties submitted motions demanding a second referendum and Jeremy Corbyn made clear he would be \u0026ldquobound by conference\u0026rsquos decision on the issue.  But activists\u0026rsquo hopes of the party throwing its weight behind a People\u0026rsquos Vote were dashed when, rather than committing the party to supporting a new referendum, the motion simply stated that \u0026ldquo we cannot get a general election, Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote.  Mr McDonnell insisted a general election would be \u0026ldquothe real People\u0026rsquos Vote because it would give the public the chance to change the team carrying out the negotiations, replacing Theresa May with a Labour government.  But he acknowledged that debate on the conference floor today on the issue \u0026ldquomay be rumbustious.  His Brexit-backing colleague Kate Hoey said it would be \u0026ldquoelectoral suicide  the party supported a second referendum as voters would feel let down.  She added: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom very pleased we\u0026rsquove got this wonderful Labour Party fudge tomorrow, which does not move our party on in any real change on our policy.  Len McCluskey, General Secretary of the Unite union, backed Mr McConnell, saying the option of remaining in the EU should not be on the ballot paper in a second referendum  Mrs May\u0026rsquos Brexit strategy collapsed.  Yet later to add confusion to the row, Mr McDonnell appeared to backtrack, saying all options \u0026ldquowould be on the table.  Earlier at conference, the Shadow Chancellor in his keynote speech noted how senior Tories were drawing up secret plans for a snap general election.  To cheers and applause, he declared: \u0026ldquoThe message from this conference is: bring it on...  \u0026ldquoWhenever the General Election comes, we are ready ready to campaign for victory, ready for Government, ready to build the future.  Today, Sir Keir made clear Labour was preparing to vote against the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Brexit deal as it was clear it would not meet the party\u0026rsquos six tests.  The Shadow Brexit Secretary committed his party to vote down any so-called \u0026ldquoblind Brexit as it would risk Britain jumping \u0026ldquointo the unknown.  Last night, at conference\u0026rsquos Scots Night, Mr Corbyn, who made clear Labour would win power because it would \u0026ldquocrucially, gain seats all across Scotland, said his party would take the Tory Government to task on Brexit.  \u0026ldquoWe are not going to allow industry and jobs to be destroyed by a fight within the Tory Party between those who believe in some kind of Rule Britannia-style around the world and those who are incapable of forming a decent relationship with somebody across the table and can\u0026rsquot negotiate."},{"url":null,"title":"leonard-pledges-land-reform-to-end-dominance-of-feudal-private-landlords","story":"  The Scottish Labour leader in his keynote conference speech also made clear his party in power would give more state aid to Scottish businesses instead of foreign-owned companies.  The self-styled Corbynista insisted that society should \u0026ldquostop iding people on the basis of nationality and start uniting them on the basis of class.  He insisted the \u0026ldquoreal ision in Britain was not between Scotland and England but between the wealth owners and the wealth creators.  Deriding the Tories\u0026rsquo \u0026ldquofervent devotion to inequality and the Nationalists\u0026rsquo \u0026ldquotimidity and mediocrity, the Central Scotland MSP said it was time for \"moral courage and audacity\" from Labour and proposed a wealth tax on Scotland\u0026rsquos wealthiest 10 per cent, which, he calculated, would raised \u0026pound3.7 billion for public services.  On land reform, he said Labour had unfinished business and that after abolishing feudalism in the first term of the Scottish Parliament the nation was still living with \u0026ldquofeudal ownership with 432 private landowners owning half of privately-owned land in Scotland.  Describing the earth as a \u0026ldquocommon treasure, he insisted what was needed was land ownership in Scotland for the many and not the few.  A Scottish Labour government would introduce a new Land Reform Act to break up the dominance of private landowners and will look at the possibility of introducing a tax on land value, capping the amount on landowners\u0026rsquo beneficial interest and a residential requirement on absentee landowners.  Mr Leonard also pledged to overhaul state aid for business, Regional Selective Assistance[RSA], to provide more support for local industries and home-grown businesses after the crisis with marine energy company BiFab, which left communities facing ruin as hundreds of workers were threatened with redundancy earlier this year.  He party leader stressed how reform of RSA would prevent foreign-owned companies continuing to benefit from nearly twice as much RSA than Scottish companies.  In his speech, he also promised that the next Labour manesto would oppose another independence referendum and called for a \u0026ldquofederal Britain with more powers for the Scottish Parliament."},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-dont-like-immigration-better-stick-with-the-union","story":"  Take the SNP. The ruling party has long been making noises that Scotland - and an independent Scotland in particular - needs an influx of working-age immigrants to keep its economy afloat, and earlier this year it made the case for Scotland taking control of its own borders regardless of whether it remains part of the UK or not.  The bid has met with a mixed response from the public, with respected pollster Sir John Curtice finding in January that 63 per cent of Scots wanted to keep the same immigration rules as the UK, while a report issued last week by the National Conversation on Immigration suggested that practically the same proportion  now back immigration devolution.  Part of the reason for the flip-flopping is likely to do with the focus on the benefits immigration brings to the economy as a whole, with little attention given to how it impacts on us inidually. Yet you only need to look at the state pension, a benefit every one of us should expect to receive sooner or later, to see the dference greater immigration could make.  It is no secret that Scotland has a rapidly ageing population and in its Sustainable Growth Commission report the SNP noted that while the country\u0026rsquos pensioner population is expected to grow by 28% in the next 25 years the working-age population will grow by just 1%. This matters because, contrary to popular opinion, our tax and national insurance contributions are not being collected in inidual state-pension pots to be paid out on retirement, but rather are being used to fund current pensioners\u0026rsquo monthly payments, just as future generations\u0026rsquo taxes will be used to pay ours. It also matters in the context of the independence debate because in the UK as a whole the pensioner population is expected to grow by 33% and the working-age population by 11%, meaning the need for increased immigration, while still there, is less pressing.  The implication of this is clear: without a marked increase in the working-age population, an independent Scotland would be unable to continue paying the state pension - a benefit we should all be entitled to in some shape or form \u0026ndash without taking drastic, and electorally unpopular, action such as increasing taxes or raising the retirement age.  We all know how popular the former idea is, and the UK Government\u0026rsquos plan to press ahead with the latter has met with signicant opposition north of the Border due to le expectancy in some parts of Scotland being so low. Increasing immigration, and so the tax take, would have the potential to negate the need for doing either.  Of course this is all moot for now, with a Home Office-commissioned report issued last week by the independent Migration Advisory Committee concluding that \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos economic situation is [not] sufficiently dferent from that of the rest of the UK to justy a very dferent migration policy.  There will be some in the yes campaign that say this only strengthens the argument for independence, but the problem is that those shouting loudest for a second referendum appear to be the least likely to embrace an increase in immigration on any scale, let alone the scale an independent Scotland would require in order to thrive.  It should come as no surprise that there exists a scepticism towards incomers when a hard-core of indy supporters so vocally hanker after a country that is ours alone. Indeed, ahead of the 2014 independence referendum St Andrews academic David McCollum led a study that found \u0026ldquoevidence of some  hostility towards migration on the part of the general public in Scotland and a possible link between nationalist leanings and opposition to \u0026lsquoOthers\u0026rsquo. This opposition appears to have crystallised into the backward-looking \u0026lsquothis land is our land-ism\u0026rsquo of the kind of die-hard secessionist who believes that screening Mel Gibson\u0026rsquos Braveheart at a rally will strengthen the indy cause.  Regardless of political stance, as an electorate we are always asked to make binary decisions - him or her, red or blue, in or out, yes or no - when the implications of those decisions are anything but black and white. In the normal course of events backing the wrong horse doesn\u0026rsquot matter too much because another election will always come along to let you change your mind. With referendums, however, the decision is far more binding, meaning voters will have to sacrice some of their beliefs in favour of other, more palatable ones.  While some in the electorate may have independence at the top of their wish list and will do anything to get the chance to vote for it, the truth is that  immigration is not up there with it then even the staunchest of independentistas would be better off sticking with the UK, in all its Brexity glory."},{"url":null,"title":"turning-glasgow-on-to-health-benefits-of-vegetables","story":"  A lack of fruit and vegetables in our diet has been identied as one of the major causes of serious illness, yet Glasgow\u0026rsquos consumption of vegetables in some areas is falling at an alarming rate.

GCFN chairwoman Abi Mordin said: \u0026ldquoPeople may be surprised to see what can be grown in the city.

Judges were drawn from the meat industry experts and enthusiastic sausage aficionados.Paul Boyle, President of the Scottish Craft Butchers said: “All butchers think we make the best products but it is not until you pitch them against others that you find out just how good they really are. “To win awards in this evaluation is a great honour for the recipients because the standards are high and by highlighting the best available this serves as an important signpost for sausage lovers on the quest for the best.                                                                                                         “I know how important sausages are to customers and I hope that all recipients of awards attract new and repeat business.”Jill Bartlett of The Dalesman Group added: “Speciality sausages are undoubtedly a key driver in the revival of the great British Banger.“Families are seeking artisan gourmet ingredients as well as healthier options including low fat and leaner proteins from their local craft butchers.“Dalesman continues to deliver inspiration through its innovative speciality culinary and al speciality sausage mixes to the artisan butcher.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"workshop fun for inverurie children","story":"        Children with learning dficulties in Inverurie will take part in an exciting musical workshop next year thanks to a north east charity.

He was aged only 29 but during his short le distinguished himself as one of the foremost archaeologists of his day.Alexander Henry Rhind was born in Wick on July 26, 1833. His parents, Josiah and Margaret , had lost 11 children in infancy.Josiah had two spells as provost of Wick and succeeded Robert Innes of Thrumster as agent for the Commercial Bank. He owned substantial property in the new and bustling Pulteneytown and settled himself in his property at Sibster where the young Alexander grew up.Alexander attended Pulteneytown Academy, going on to study natural history and natural philosophy at Edinburgh University.Following his work in 1851 on the cairns at Yarrows, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries at 19 years of age. He argued for the inclusion of a broch as an example of native architecture as part of the Great Exhibition and wrote a paper advocating the extension of treasure trove to objects other than precious materials.His failing health took him to warmer climes, where he studied and published extensively.He bequeathed a number of legacies to his native Wick, including the establishment of an institute \"for the industrial training of young women\" at Rhind House, and provided for two scholarships at Edinburgh University.Tuesday 25 Sep 2018 11:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Blackmail claims over mums to be","story":"A WHISTLEBLOWER at Raigmore Hospital has alleged that midwives were \u0026ldquoblackmailed into taking on patients from Elgin in order to prevent Caithness mums-to-be from travelling to Glasgow to give birth.The midwe, whose identity has been concealed on request as the person is contracted to NHS Highland, said that due to maternity services at Dr Gray\u0026rsquos Hospital in Elgin being downgraded, expectant mums in Moray had to travel to Inverness to give birth.A large percentage of women in Caithness also have to travel to Raigmore.The additional workload from Elgin has led to anger among midwery staff who are also aggrieved that pregnant Caithness women were allegedly used as a bargaining chip.The whistle-blower said: \u0026ldquoThe maternity services at Elgin were downgraded and that meant an influx of new patients on top of the ones we already have from Caithness.\u0026ldquoWe made it clear to management that we were overworked as it is and a new batch of expectant mums would increase that even further.\u0026ldquoWe asked  they could be erted to Aberdeen but we were told  we refused to take on Elgin patients then the Caithness ones would be removed from our workload.\u0026ldquoEssentially, that meant that women would have to travel all the way from Caithness to Glasgow in order to give birth.\u0026ldquoWe did not want that to happen and we reluctantly took on the extra workload.\u0026ldquoThis comes at a time of year when all the Christmas surprises come into the world.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Tuesday 25 Sep 2018 11:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117588.jpg","title":"Preloved pet trade blasted","story":"\u0026nbspA CAITHNESS-based animal rights campaigner is calling for a change in the law to stop \"heartless\" pet owners from selling unwanted animals online.Natalie Oag, who is backing a proposal by the Scottish Government for the introduction of a special licence for dog owners, says animals listed on sites such as Preloved are the victims of a \"throwaway society\".\"Pets shouldn\u0027t be viewed the same as inanimate objects when no longer wanted,\" said Ms Oag, the Highland representative for the Peta Foundation .Pets listed on Preloved include a 9ft python available for \u0026pound1000 and, until a few days ago, a heavily muscled eight-month-old \"untrained\" micro pocket American bulldog for \u0026pound2000 \u0026ndash listed as it did not get along with another dog.Other listings include a sheepdog which \"adores humans\" but is not interested in sheep, while on Gumtree \u0026ndash which has recently imposed a \u0026pound2.99 fee to deter \"casual\" trading \u0026ndash pets for sale include an 18-month-old cat looking for a \"stable\" household, a pair of two-year-old \"very tame\" rabbits and a one-year-old cat whose owner claims to have developed a skin allergy.It is not illegal to post adverts and sell pets online.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the y cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it. We had always seen Marcus as he was at rugby \u0026ndash a strong, witty and kind gentleman. After talking with more team-mates who have opened up and described their own experiences the horrying statistics become relatable.The cycling trio hope to be arriving at Land\u0026rsquos End in a fortnight\u0026rsquos time and are hoping to raise \u0026pound2000 for the Marcus in Mind fundraiser set up by his family.To make a donation, visit the website on: justgiving/crowdfunding/for-marcusTuesday 25 Sep 2018 11:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117685.jpg","title":"Wind turbine blades hold up town traffic","story":"\u0026nbspMOTORISTS making their way through Wick faced a delay as an extra-long convoy of trucks set out for Bad a\u0027 Cheo wind farm on the Causewaymire.Three giant blades each measuring 45 metres were driven up from Wick harbour by lorries from Campbeltown-based McFadyens with an escort of the company\u0027s support vehicles. Because of the sharp turn from River Street up the Clf Road the lorries are required to reverse all the way up from Wick harbour after the blades are loaded on their trailers by crane. They then negotiate the turn up the Clf from River Street and can proceed as normal.All possible obstacles are temporarily repositioned and in the case of River Street this means folding over a hinged lamp-post so the blade tip doesn\u0027t hit it as the lorry turns.The three McFadyens trucks were monitored by the company\u0027s support vehicles and road policing officers.The Senvion MM92 turbine comes in eight pieces that the haulage company conveys to the site in convoys that never go beyond three lorries.Bad a\u0027 Cheo wind farm, which began construction in March 2017, will feature 13 of these 2.05MW turbines with a tip height of 112 metres.Tuesday 25 Sep 2018 11:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September 23, 2018 at 3:30 pmA campaign to promote short breaks to Orkney during the quieter, off-peak months has received £30,000 of VisitScotland Growth Funding.

The awards run across the UK with winners expected to be announced in November.Carolyn Wilson, who runs a local business and is also a Cromarty Firth ward councillor, said the town was \"buzzing\" after the shortlisting, which pits the town against bids from Glasgow, Kirriemuir, Kirkwall, Newport-on-Tay and Turrf.Mrs Wilson said: \"There\u0026rsquos a real feelgood factor. Normally I\u0026rsquom sceptical about these sort of competitions but this has been great. It\u0026rsquos an opportunity for everyone to take a look at what they\u0026rsquore doing. There have been lots of local winners through a competition run by Visa and we\u0026rsquoll have a pop-up workshop on social media. These competitions can sometimes give a helpful kick to improve things.\"High Streets minister Jake Berry hailed Alness and said: \"The awards celebrate the great work that is being done to revive, adapt and ersy the nation\u0026rsquos high streets and the quality of entries this year has been outstanding. This is a great opportunity to show your support for the hard work going on in Alness High Street so get voting!\"Sundeep Kaur, head of UK and Ireland merchant services at Visa, added: \"Alness High Street is a fantastic example of a high street that has made huge strides in transforming itself to offer a range of dferent experiences for locals and visitors alike.\"In particular, its entry highlighted the shopkeepers in Alness who have worked hard to provide an exciting shopping experience, with each committing to offering something unique and which offers choice for consumers.\"The shortlisted high streets will now battle it out in a public vote, which accounts for 30 per cent of the final scoring, and will then have the chance to impress an expert judging panel as they seek to be crowned Britain\u0026rsquos best.Those interested in participating in the public vote can visit www.thegreatbritishhighstreet for more information.Inspiration for other Ross-shire High Streets?

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0026rsquos historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0026rsquos committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0026rsquos financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Tuesday 25 Sep 2018 11:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

However Scottish Water has been in regular contact with stakeholders and I will wait to hear the assurances given to the community next week.\"The event will run between 3.30pm and 7.30pm on Monday.Share your views on the proposals by emailing newsdesk@spp-group or writing to us at the address on our letters page.Tuesday 25 Sep 2018 11:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The atmospheric walk is a magnet for visitors and local alike.The Avoch Primary School pupil\u0026rsquos mother Julie Mackay reported the \"nasty\" burglary on a community Facebook page prompting a run of comments \u0026ndash including some which suggested the culprits may have a problem with the natural area being studded with colourful wooden toy fairy houses.However, the effort to replace the items was considered a great success despite the dissident tone.Mrs Mackay , of High Street, Rosemarkie, said: \"We replaced the pink boot with the money that had been collected by the Panacea shop in Rosemarkie, which was around \u0026pound20. The shop owner Cornelia Hughes gave them to us at cost price and she also donated the wobbly-roofed house.\"Cornelia is seen by the children as the white witch of the Fairy Glen as she makes \"get well\" lotions and potions and sells fairy dust and crystals in her shop and she dresses up at Halloween looking quite the part. And our local posties Wilma Stewart and Sheila MacDonald donated the watering can fairy house.\"She added: \"We all went to Fairy Glen and the local children helped to glue them down.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"        A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.

Rather than graty him by repeatedly referring to his meanderings, I’ll use them as a jump-off point to explain why ­Brian Beacom’s rant is not only unhelpful to women, but also to discussion about the other side of the gender coin: masculinity.            In this age of growing awareness of the myriad challenges many women face, I am trying to reason as honestly and openly as I can. I feel it is my responsibility to look beyond the first emotional impulse on any given issue and try to see the bigger picture.             Admittedly, this hasn’t been an easy road, and especially true where gender is ­concerned. It took me a long time to reconcile the ­personal experience of feeling frightened by women as a kid with the political and cultural reality that many of the challenges, prejudices and threats women face are – like many of the roles assigned to them by society – a direct result of their gender. The notion that so many ­women feel powerless, threatened or afraid was hard to map onto my own experience, where women always appeared to be in charge – sometimes ruling with an iron fist. Realising the personal and political are not mutually exclusive has been bumpy and sometimes frightening. In the age of social media it requires almost no effort to be extremely uncharitable, whether dishing it out or on the receiving end. Beacom makes a mockery of those of us who are grappling with matters of gender and masculinity, sometimes counterintuitively. It takes a lot of work  to resist hardwired reactions to a cascade of conflicting social media posts, blogs, articles and news stories. Where, often, men are discussed in generalities that do not account for the specicity of our experiences and where we are often commanded to “talk about our feelings” and “stop making it all about us” simultaneously. It was hard for me to accept, for example, that my mother’s aggression and violence towards me was, as I have heard it said, simply another form of toxic masculinity – that her abusive behaviour was rooted in trauma she experienced at the hands of men when she was a young woman. I had a lot of baggage to unpack and as I did so, much of it on public platforms, I was accosted on occasion. Sometimes my assailants had a point. Sometimes that point was drowned out by social media hyperbole. Ironically, the people who were most helpful, compassionate and understanding were other feminists who valued a willingness to ­examine my own attitudes and behaviour over a carefully constructed avatar that always knew the wokest thing to say.I licked my wounds and kept going. All around me I could see once powerful men being recontextualised as predators and abusers. One thing they all had in common was a seemingly sincere belief that they had done nothing wrong. It struck me that, just because I didn’t regard myself as ever harming, harassing or abusing anybody, this didn’t automatically mean I hadn’t. But this is a dficult thing to confront, especially in the public domain, when you are caught in the crossfire between two types of men who are always engaged in the ­discussion around gender.            In one corner, we have the woke bros. They are a good lot. They use whatever means available to echo the sentiments expressed by progressive women. They observe the day’s contested gender story through a feminist lens and are keen to be seen publicly standing in solidarity with whatever their comrades think. You’ll find them right across the political spectrum and, ostensibly, they were born with all the correct opinions and attitudes installed – because we never hear how they came to be so woke. Also, you rarely hear anything from them about their experiences as men, in relation to women. Nothing about what they struggle with, or those attitudes and behaviours in their private lives that haven’t always so conveniently aligned with their public proclamations. Apparently, we are to believe these guys have never intruded on a woman’s privacy out of emotional insecurity, never gratied themselves to ethically nightmarish porn and never harboured a hateful thought or said or done something that berated, hurt, pressured or harmed a woman.  Some of them even want us to accept that we live in a patriarchy that infects all who emerge from it with misogynistic impulses, but that they, themselves, are strangely unaffected.Maybe I’m just jealous because I am so evidently flawed. But while I am sure the many women with whom the woke bros stand in solidarity are thrilled to see their allies batting for the right team, the woke bros are virtually useless when it comes to engaging sections of the male population who, like me, have not been so perfectly configured, men who perhaps sense that they must change but require guidance from other men on the path – as opposed to Twitter pointers from men who only speak publicly about other behaviour and not their own. Then we have Brian Beacom types. Men who’ll go to the grave believing the song and dance they made about gender equality was a valiant cry from the wilderness – and not the agonal gasp of a privileged but increasingly irrelevant perspective. Somewhere between the woke bros and the Beacoms, sit men like me, trying to carve out a new lane where a more honest and potentially vulnerable conversation about masculinity must take place. Which is what must happen  the struggle for gender equality is ever to arrive at its final destination.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4804714.1537815363!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment labour party line offers little hope","story":"        The Labour Party conference will this afternoon vote on whether to \u0026#8220keep all options on the table\u0026#8221 when it comes to Brexit.                This aspiration, broad and vague as it is, may include the possibility of campaigning for a new referendum. But before any frustrated Remainers get too excited, it’s worth paying attention to the detail. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and is closest allies at the top of the party are no more enthusiastic about the possibility of a second referendum than they were yesterday.            Keeping all options on the table is language of the most non-committal nature. Anyone who would like to truly understand the Labour leadership’s position should pay attention to remarks made early yesterday by shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who said any so-called “People’s Vote” should be on the terms of the Brexit deal rather than on whether the UK should, in fact, remain part of the EU.            Labour Party members may yesterday have waved banners reading “Hate Brexit – Love Corbyn” but the very most it seems they can hope from the party leadership is support for a referendum which offers a choice between whatever deal Theresa May is able to salvage from the chaos - and a potentially-catastrophic no deal.Later yesterday, Mr McDonnell adopted the “all options on the table” party line but the truth was already out there.  When Mr Corbyn succeeded Ed Miliband as Labour leader in 2015, he promised a new kind of politics but it is becoming increasingly apparent that with increased trade union influence and the centralising of power to a small clique, the modern Labour party is the living breathing example of what we might consider the old politics. And the bad old politics, at that.Prime Minister Theresa May limps on, politically wounded by treacherous colleagues, humiliated by the EU, and struggling to find a vaguely plausible narrative on Brexit. Add to this unfortunate mix polling which shows growing support to reverse the decision take in 2016, and Labour is presented with the opportunity to seize the initiative, and perhaps even help the UK avert the worst impact of Brexit. Yet still he refuses to show leadership.Jeremy Corbyn may have convinced his supporters that they all have a voice in his party. Those who do not parrot the leadership line on Brexit should not, however, expect to be listened to.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4804670.1537807783!/image/image.jpg","title":"labour conference richard leonard sets out plan to target the wealthy","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

A Labour government in Scotland would ring-fence hundreds of millions of pounds of state aid funding for foreign-owned businesses and redirect it towards Scottish companies to re-train staff and save manufacturing jobs, Richard Leonard has said.            In a speech to the Labour Party conference in Liverpool, the party’s Scottish leader also committed to land reform agenda, saying Labour would explore new rules to tax foreign and absentee landlords.            And he said a Labour government would raise £3.7bn for public services through a ‘windfall’ tax on the richest iniduals in Scotland.Mr Leonard, who has recommitted Labour to opposing a second Scottish independence referendum, used his first UK conference speech since becoming leader to accuse nationalists of distracting from the fight for economic equality.“We know that the forces that threaten the le chances of children growing up by the Mersey, are the same ones that threaten the le chances of children growing up by the Clyde,” Mr Leonard said. “So we should stop iding people on the basis of nationality and start uniting them on the basis of class.”Adding that he “fully intends” to become the next First Minister of Scotland despite questions about his Yorkshire background, Mr Leonard added: “The real ision in our society is not between Scotland and England, it is between those people who own the wealth and those people who through their hard work and endeavour create the wealth.”            • : Richard Leonard: Labour will deliver federal UK and oppose Indyref2He confirmed plans to impose a windfall tax on the richest 10 per cent of Scots, as well as redirecting state aid money to firms like recently-defunct Burntisland Fabrications, in order to retrain workforces and retool industrial sites.Labour pointed to figures from Scottish Enterprise showing that since coming to power, the SNP have handed out £222.6m in Regional Selective Assistance  to foreign-owned companies, compared to £140.7m that has gone to Scottish-owned firms.The total amount of RAS has also fallen by 80 per cent since 2007.            On land reform, Mr Leonard said Labour had “unfinished business”, and said he would consider plans for a land value tax, a cap on beneficial interest, and a residency requirement for absentee landlords as part of a “radical” Land Reform Act.“Labour abolished feudalism in the first term of the Scottish Parliament, but twenty years later we are still living with feudal ownership, with four hundred and thirty-two private landowners still owning a half of all privately owned land in Scotland,” the Scottish Labour leader said. “With ownership comes power. We need land justice because our earth is a common treasury. We need land ownership in Scotland, for the many not the few.”The SNP claimed Labour’s proposed windfall tax would hit pensioners hardest.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold.

We have an EU target to reach 60 per cent by 2030, and with your help, we aim to meet this and also exceed it.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“All councils in Northern Ireland are participating in Recycle Week 2018 and we urge you to check out top tips on council’s website and Facebook page over this week to help you recycle those sometimes missed items around your household.\n\nMid and East Antrim mayor Cllr, Lindsay Millar, said: “Household waste costs over £100 per tonne landfill tax. Recycling this waste saves over 50 per cent  on this cost. \n\n“Council can redirect this cost saving to finance local civic projects across the borough. \n\n“Recycling is good for the environment and will leave our countryside and green spaces in a beautul and undisturbed state for your children and grandkids as a result of less landfill sites across the country.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Why not also check out council’s Facebook page during Recycle Week where we’ll have a Q\u0026ampA session running all week.\n\n“You can ask questions about certain waste items you’re unsure about recycling, ask about which bin to use correctly, ask questions about your local Household Recycling Centre, and more! If you don’t have access to a computer, you can always contact our Waste Helpdesk on 0300 124 5000.”\n\nBelow we’ve included some short tips and advice on recycling more from around your home.\n\nReduce - Use a lunchbox instead of plastic wrap or tin foil. Carry a fork/spoon instead of using plastic cutlery. Buy fruit and veg loose, avoiding that plastic packaging. Buy boxes rather than bottles of detergents which can then be recycled.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nRe-use - Save take-away food containers for storage of nails/screws/buttons, etc. and make pots from empty plastic bottles. Have some items you could take to your local charity shop? Most accept clothing, shoes, jewellery, household items including glasses, plates, ornaments, etc.\n\nRecycle - Use your blue bin/kerbie box for recycling plastic bottles, ice cream/margarine tubs, yoghurt pots, biscuit trays and fruit punnets. Bring large plastic items such as garden furniture and toys to your local household recycling centre.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8642067.1537454750!/image/image.jpg","title":"ian paisley by election recall process cost 188 000","story":"\nThe recall petition which failed to unseat Ian Paisley cost the public purse around \u0026#163188,000, it has emerged.\n\n                \nThe Electoral Office revealed the costings yesterday after the process – the first of its kind in the UK – came to an end after six weeks.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt is understood the bulk of the costs related to staffing the three centres where people could sign the petition in Ballymena, Ballymoney and Ballycastle.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDUP MP Mr Paisley retained his seat after 7,099 people signed, 444 short of the required number.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field -

demonstration.\n\n                \nAnticipation is mounting ahead of this year’s second annual Calor NI Leisure Show, as dozens of exhibitors joined forces recently in an action-packed launch at Lisburn’s impressive Eikon Centre.\n\n   Load the IFrame Player API code asynchronously.   tag = document.createElement  tag.src = \"https:www.youtube/player_api\"   firstScriptTag =

and sponsors of the event alike, as he announced to a delighted crowd that due to the success of last year’s event the inaugural show which is running for the second year is set to open for one full additional day due to popular demand.\n\nLaunching over the weekend of November 2, 3 and 4, Nutt Promotions will once again highlight some of the finest caravans, motorhomes, boats, jet skis, tents, cycles, fishing and all things under the leisure banner that Northern Ireland has to offer, and this year it is set to be held across two jam-packed halls for the first time.\n\nFounder of Nutt Travel, Billy Nutt MBE, who has been involved in motorsport for over 40 years, explained: ‘‘On behalf of Nutt Promotions, we are delighted that, in 2018, the Eikon Exhibition Centre have now added a further larger hall, enabling us to continue with our planned expansion. We are absolutely delighted with the set-up here, and last year for us was just unbelievable. This has given us the space to not only expand the products which were on offer last year but to incorporate new leisure pursuits such as fishing. I’m sure the fishing lake will be a great attraction in the new hall this year with the opportunity for the public to try their hand at casting. We also have more boats, more cycles and more outdoor gear on display with both Decathlon and Go Outdoors coming onboard. The thing we love about the Leisure Show is that local businesses come together and work as a team - I think it is just brilliant.’’\n\nBilly also delightedly announced that renowned chef Paula McIntyre will be at the show for three days with three demonstrations per day.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nShow sponsors including Downtown Radio and main sponsor, Calor NI\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaula enthused: ‘‘I’m delighted to be involved. Confined cooking facilities needn’t be a barrier to delicious food. \n\n‘‘I’ll be using the best of local ingredients to cook up dishes that can be prepared on a couple of rings or butane camper stove, I have first-hand experience of cooking in a campervan so it’ll be great to be able to show what can be done to the wider audience!’’\n\nWith a launch which included an eye-popping somersaulting spectacle from the Go-Fyt Warriors, who will be hosting a fun-fuelled challenge on the day suitable for all ages, this year’s show promises to provide all-round entertainment for the entire family. Representative Kevin Howlette said: ‘‘We’re delighted to have Go-Fyt Warrior here in a series of races and challenges for you all to become NI Warriors. Once you enter our ninja challenge your le will never be the same again.’’\n\nThe family-friendly event, which this year will also host a new dog show, will also boast refreshments, entertainment and camping packages - and is offering trips to local shopping centres for those wanting to make the most out of their weekend. Billy added: ‘‘Last year we were happy to welcome members of the Caravan Club and Motorhome Owners Club to stay with us in Balmoral Park for the weekend.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that this year this arrangement will continue and will be extended to members of the Republic of Ireland branches of these clubs. We plan to have over 500 units camping with us over that weekend with something for all to see and do.

But following reports of many women being left in agonising pain, there have been calls for the procedure to be banned, or at least suspended until the long-term safety of the implants can be evaluated.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAt the age of 36, a gynaecologist recommended that Jackie have a vaginal mesh implant fitted as a way of alleviating the urinary incontinence problem she’d been left with after having her second child.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn March 2005 she underwent surgery and it worked well. She recovered quickly, but unfortunately the plastic implant soon started to cause her problems.\n\n“After a year or two I noticed the tops of my legs were getting really painful and stf and I just thought I must be getting old, though I was only 38 at the time,” she explained.\n\n“I went to doctors ious times about the pain in my legs and got x-rays, but they didn’t really show anything. In 2009 I stopped doing any sort of impact exercise. I couldn’t run. I couldn’t really walk very far without getting pain in my legs, my feet and hips. I kept going back to the doctor and nothing was showing. In 2013 I was really struggling and I went to rheumatologist who told me that I didn’t have arthritis. I went to an orthopaedic consultant who told me he couldn’t see anything wrong with me. And then by 2015 I had seen an article online where a woman called Kath Sansom had started a campaign group called ‘Sling The Mesh’ and she was suffering from very similar complications to me, and it was just like a lightbulb going off in my head - this was 10 years after I’d had it put in.”\n\nJackie, who claims she wasn’t told about the risks so couldn’t make an informed decision about getting the implant, says the pain she suffered as a result of the device ruined 12 years of her le.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It had a really detrimental impact on my le. I was struggling to walk and I was in pain and exhausted every single day of my le. I felt about 90. I was stf, sore and I just felt ill. For me to go to a doctor and my issues not to be recognised or accepted was just horrendous.” \n\nJackie was referred to a gynaecologist who told her the implant wasn’t causing her problems, but she refused to accept that was the case. She decided she had no other option but to challenge the doctor’s findings, and eventually had to pay for specialist treatment in England.\n\nThe 49-year-old office worker had a scan in London which showed that her implant was in the wrong place and was causing her pain. She finally underwent surgery at a hospital in Oxford in March this year to have her mesh removed.\n\n“As soon as I woke up the dference was amazing,” she said. “I’m still not perfect, but I’m an awful lot better than I was.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThrough the UK-wide ‘Sling The Mesh’ group, Jackie heard many stories of women from Northern Ireland who are suffering similar problems to those she experienced. So, in a bid to help them, she decided to set up her own local support group on Facebook, and it already has around 200 members.\n\n“This is a repeated story across the UK, not just in Northern Ireland,” she continued. “These ladies are going to their surgeons and they are being told ‘It’s not the mesh that’s causing your problems’, or ‘It’s all in your head’. It’s almost like they’re reading off a script.\n\n“These women are in pain, some of them are constantly getting infections, others are on antibiotics every day.\n\n“Their lives are a misery, they have no sex lives, their marriages have broken down, some have lost their jobs, they can’t enjoy their le, it’s just horrendous. That’s what spurred me on to push for some sort of recognition that there is an issue in Northern Ireland and something has to be done.”\n\nWhile the NHS says “the majority of women treated with mesh respond well to the treatment”, it acknowledges that “the Medicines \u0026amp Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  has received reports of complications associated with vaginal meshes - mostly regarding persistent pain, sexual problems, mesh exposure through vaginal tissues and occasionally injury to nearby organs, such as the bladder or bowel.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nJackie, who was the first woman to report her implant to the Northern Ireland Adverse Incident Centre at Stormont, is campaigning for the use of vaginal mesh implants to be suspended.\n\n“In Scotland there was a moratorium put on the use of mesh in 2014, by the Scottish government, and it doesn’t make sense that in the rest of the UK women aren’t afforded the same protection,” she said.\n\n“We want the use of mesh suspended whilst there is a review ongoing. We want the same protection that they have in Scotland. We also want a national register to register how many mesh complications there actually are.\n\n“So many women are being left traumatised by this.

Michael explained how the runaway success of his creation has seen views of up to 900,000 on the page, and that his characters are now set to come to le at the Waterfront in October.\n“I grew up with three older sisters, I’m the only boy and the youngest so a lot of my inspiration has come from my family, I’ve seen and heard it all,” he laughed.\n“The Facebook page has become so successful that it makes you want to do more, keep creating, keep entertaining people. I remember when I posted the first video and people were commenting underneath saying ‘more, more’.”\nMichael’s only foray on the stage so far was “when I was in Primary Seven in St Kevin’s and I wore my mummy’s white skinny jeans to play the Angel Gabriel,” he laughed.\n“I feel brilliant that I’m going to be performing all the characters for the first time at the Waterfront. I’ve never seen anything like this, like the following the site has, it’s crazy, but good crazy,” he said.\nThe show will be directed by Alan McKee, one half of comedic duo Grimes and McKee, and himself no stranger to the director’s chair.\n“Joe Rea, who is producing the show, spoke to me about Michael and said ‘this guy is very funny, I think there is a show here’. I ran Michael’s page past the focus group of teenage girls in my house and they loved it, there are plenty of songs and dance routines for everyone to take part in.\n“The fact we are putting on the show shows the power of social media, you can’t ignore that number of hits, that amount of likes and views.\n“Michael has a great ear, he writes exactly the way people speak, warts and all. He is a really original voice.\n“This is the first time I’m directing a piece that has come this way and it has really opened my eyes to look out for other things that don’t necessarily come via the traditional route,  it’s good people will pick up on it. It’s a version of word of mouth just how successful Belfast Girls has become which is the best publicity you can get.”\nBelfast Girls will be performed at the Waterfront from October 9-20.

He just went from a child to an adult.\n\n“As he grew up as an adult, he turned to a spiral of drink and drugs. He thought it was helping him but in reality it wasn’t. He didn’t know when to stop.\n\n“His doctor wrote him a letter, basically saying could he be housed in some sort of sheltered accommodation. It never happened.\n\n“As parents, we were desperate. He was either sitting in his room or out on the drink and drugs.\n\n“He couldn’t get out of the loop he was in. He needed serious help and he just was not getting it. It was a constant cycle that was going downwards. He needed professional help to deal with the grief he suffered.”\n\nIn April, Billy and Sharon were told by Social Services that it was not safe for Sebastian to live in the family home with his younger brother  and three sisters, ,  and .\n\n“As  putting him on to the street was the solution for a vulnerable adult who has addiction and mental health problems,” added Billy. “Social Services’ attitude was basically Sebastian is out of the house and the kids are safe. Now their big brother is dead. They are going to need counselling. It is just a vicious circle.\n\n“We are terried of a knock-on effect. What  someone else in our family decides to take their own le? We were given no help to find him somewhere. We had to find him some sort of sheltered dwelling to live in.”\n\nOn August 13, Sebastian’s West Belfast flat and the Haggan family home were raided by police who claimed they had a warrant to search for ammunition and weapons. The family have complained about the searches to the Police Ombudsman. Sebastian took his own le just five days later and Billy believes the raid set him over the edge. \n\n“Sebastian was out on the streets again after the raid when his landlord put him out. I got him sorted with a place in Ballymena. Five days after the raid, he killed himself. I think it was a trigger – he just could not cope with any more stress.\n\n“He was found with heroin paraphernalia lying around him. We are still waiting on official confirmation but it seems pretty likely he took a heroin overdose to end his own le. Earlier this year, he told his sister the best way to commit suicide was a heroin overdose. He was right.”\nBilly and Sharon have criticised the system which they say is failing people suffering from mental health issues.\n“Sebastian needed professional help but it just was not there. We begged for help from a psychiatrist and for him to be sectioned but nobody would do it.\n\n“We think he attempted suicide on three occasions before. After the second attempt when his sister rescued him from jumping off a bridge, the hospital said he was ‘stable’ and that he ‘wasn’t that bad’. \n\nSebastian himself was willing himself to get help. What more did he need to do? He’d just tried to take his own le. The authorities need to listen to families who are suffering. The system has crashed, it simply does not exist. Hospitals just cannot deal with the issue. \n\nPoliticians need to start doing something. There is a deluge of mental health patients at the moment and basically no help out there for them. Nobody seems to want to tackle the problem. More mental health staff and teams are needed.\n\n “We tried everything we could. At the end of the day, Sebastian was the one who injected himself and killed himself but it all goes back to mental health issues. \n\n“We won’t be the last family to suffer. I wouldn’t like to think what the total number of suicides will rise to. There are more people killed by suicide than on the roads now.”\n\nIf you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues in this article, call Leline on 0808 808 8000 or PIPS on 02890 805850.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"west belfast man wont face second trial","story":"\n\nA man\n who admitted preventing the lawful burial of his elderly neighbour will not face a trial for stealing a second bank card from her burgled flat.\nSentencing of Robert Sharkey, 24, originally of Larkspur Rise, will take place next month.\nHe was convicted of 11 charges, including using one of Marie Conlon\u0026#8217s debit cards to buy nearly £6,000 worth of pizza.\nA remaining charge of theft of a debit card will remain on the books.\nThe remains of 68-year-old Ms Conlon were discovered in the bedroom of her West Belfast flat off the Suffolk Road last October.\nSharkey – a neighbour at the time – was arrested and subsequently charged with preventing the lawful burial of a corpse on dates between August 2015 and October 2017.\nSharkey, now with an address at Grays Hill in Bangor, pleaded guilty to preventing her lawful burial and to breaking into her home and taking batteries, tools and a coffee mug, and also of stealing both £50 in cash from her, and a First Trust debit card.\nHe also entered guilty pleas to six separate counts of fraud by false representation,  namely using Ms Conlon\u0026#8217s First Trust bank card without authority to buy food totalling £5,988.39 from Domino\u0026#8217s Pizza over a period from October 2015 to 2017.\nHe also bought goods from Sainsbury\u0026#8217s to the value of £3,279.80 from July 2016 to October 2017, and purchased mobile phone credit amounting to £1,030 from March 2016 to October 2017.\nSharkey also admitted using the card to pay Power NI £285, as well payments to the Land and Property Service of £573.83 in September 2016, and £586.20 the following September.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36692914.ece/19ee7/AUTOCROP/w140square/air.jpg","title":"free belfast telegraph transfer test answer booklets","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Pointing toward the absence of the Executive, the airport said it was of \"greater concern\" there was a lack of any economically driven strategy which was creating setbacks. \n\n\"The basic fact remains that the flight schedule provided by the airline from Belfast  was neither flexible nor attractive enough to appeal to the local travelling public,\" she said.\n\n\"There is signicant – and prospectively increasing – market demand between Northern Ireland and the USA / Canada, particularly focused upon New York and Toronto as gateways.\"\n\nShe added: \"The Northern Ireland – North America market remains strong. We will continue to work to ensure that partner airlines are encouraged to serve our market in an appropriate and sustainable manner.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dups ian paisley asked council to pay for 1500 table at dinner council chief embarrassed","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

or 700 people - on the number of over-85s in 2016. \n\nSuch an increase might seem insignicant, but it is part of an upward trend over the past decade which has seen the population aged over-85 grow by a third, increasing by 9,200 people between 2007 and 2017. \n\nThis growth is five times faster than any other section of the population, and the number of over-85s in Northern Ireland now stands at 37,200.  \n\nPart of this population are the 274 centenarians  recorded living in Northern Ireland - which is around one for every 10,000 people in the province. \n\nAlmost 90% of centenarians in Northern Ireland are women. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Nisra\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nIn 2017 there were a total of 14,430 centenarians living across the United Kingdom. \n\nThe situation in other regions of the United Kingdom reflects that of Northern Ireland, with a growing number of people in the oldest age category . \n\nInterestingly, the UK\u0027s Office of National Statistics has recorded an 85% increase in the number of centenarians over the past 15 years - but says figures show a decrease between 2016 and 2018 due to lower birth numbers during World War One. \n\nThe number is expected to pick up again from 2019, or 100 years from the end of the war. \n\nResponding to the statistics, a NISRA statistician said: “The new figures released today indicate that the population aged 85 or more continues to rise, reaching over 37,000 people in 2017.\n\n“Indeed over the decade , this population sub-group has grown over five times faster than the overall Northern Ireland population.\n\n“Despite the rapid growth those people aged 85 or more today only make up around 2% of our population.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland could become singaporestyle free port after brexit says business chief mckenzie","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Niall Carson/PA.\n\n\n\n\nShe is chief executive of recruitment companies which operate in Northern Ireland and the Republic and is policy chairwoman of the Federation of Small Businesses  in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn Northern Ireland small firms employ more than big business and the public sector put together, and Brexit is crucial.\n\nMs McKenzie added: “For us any impact on small business would be very detrimental to the economy.”\n\nShe warned of the effect of a hard Irish border on political stability as well as on the impoverished and those on benefits.\n\n“The marginalised communities need those jobs that a hard Brexit impacting the economy could take away.”\n\nShe has suggested to all political parties the idea of creating a free port.\n\n“That would be transformational for this society, whether you are a unionist, nationalist or neither.\n\n“A good, prosperous Northern Ireland is good for the nationalist cause  they want the Republic of Ireland to vote to have Northern Ireland within the island.\n\n“It is also really good from a unionist perspective because the happier people are in a Northern Ireland, the more prosperous, the less likely they are to want to change the constitutional position.\n\n“So for us it is a no-brainer, it is good for everybody and there is not any party or government that sees that as a threat.”\n\nShe said it also solved Great Britain’s problem of getting trade in through a friendly port, therefore without worrying about dferent customs imposed at the other side.\n\n“They have more control, I guess, with Northern Ireland being part of the UK.\n\n“There is some technical detail to work on but everyone we have floated it with has really been, even people you might be surprised, have been quite open to the idea.\n\n“People seem content enough with it and are asking about how the mechanics might work.”\n\nShe admitted the technicalities still had to be resolved.\n\n“JFK got into office and said in this decade we will have a man on the moon.

But in a dire situation when there are few good options, desperate measures can sometimes be necessary. A referendum may be the least bad option now.\"\n\nMr O\u0027Brien suggested that the most likely outcome of the Brexit negotiations at present was the UK crashing out without a deal.\n\nHe suggested the blame for this almost entirely lied with the British side.\n\nHowever, he admitted: \"The decision by the Irish and EU side last November to demand of the British that they concede the principle that part of their sovereign territory - Northern Ireland - be removed from their customs territory was a major miscalculation. \n\n\"Perhaps it is because Europeans have shared the same customs territory for more than half a century that the signicance of the proposal was under-estimated. But under-estimated it was.\n\n\"Countries do not cede their customs territory to others on demand.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rhi players whose witness statements have just been divulged arlene foster richard bullick conor murphy stephen harron david gordon and ciaran oconnor","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

He was subsequently appointed head of public affairs at MCE Public Relations. \n\nHe served as the party\u0027s head of policy from 2002 to 2007 when devolution had been suspended and was a key figure in negotiations which led to the restoration of Stormont.\n\nThe former barrister was appointed special adviser to Peter Robinson in 2008 and also served under Mrs Foster when she took over in January 2016. He was paid a £92,000 salary. Former DUP Spad Dr Andrew Crawford previously told the inquiry that he shared a confidential legal letter with Peter Robinson\u0027s lobbyist son at the request of either the then First Minister or Mr Bullick.\n\nConor Murphy\n\nThe Sinn Fein MLA was first elected to represent Newry and Armagh in 1998.\n\nHe resigned in 2011 but replaced Mickey Brady in 2015 and was re-elected in 2017.\n\nThe former Regional Development Minister has served on numerous committees during his time at Stormont. Crucially he sat on the Enterprise, Trade and Investment committee between 2015 and 2017 as the deputy chairperson.\n\nMr Murphy claims he only became aware of incentive problems following the release of an Audit Office report into RHI in July 2016 but was aware the Deputy First Minister wanted the scheme closed from February of the same year.\n\nStephen Harron\n\nMr Harron worked as a salesman for Hegan Biomass Ltd between 2015 and 2016.\n\nIn this role he met with clients of the Dungannon-based renewable heating firm in addition to clients he had sourced himself.\n\nHis job was to assist them with the purchase and installation of biomass boilers and renewable energy products.\n\nMr Harron purchased two boilers himself in February 2016 and contacted Mrs Foster seeking a delay to the closure of the scheme.\n\nHe says the boilers he installed in commercial units have not been accredited and that he never received payment under the RHI scheme.\n\nDavid Gordon\n\nThe former BBC NI producer turned spin doctor took up a role as NI Executive Press Secretary in October 2016.\n\nHis job was to give \"well informed\" and \"strategic\" media advice to the First Minister, Deputy First Minister and the Executive. In December 2016 he sent an email to Mr Bullick in which he discussed pre-empting a BBC story by dealing with the \"real story\" of why cost controls were delayed in 2015.\n\nHe was tasked with advising the Executive Office and Department for the Economy in relation to RHI and met with a range of high-profile people over the Christmas holidays, including the head of the Civil Service Sir Malcolm McKibbin and Attorney General John Larkin.\n\nCiaran O’Connor\n\nThe fomrer landscape gardener was appointed as a Sinn Fein special adviser in 2015.\n\nHe was one of four special advisers attached to the former Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness but also took instructions from Aidan McAteer.\n\nIn February 2016 he told a colleague that he forwarded a memo from Jonathan Bell to his party\u0027s policy advice group  but denies any involvement in or understanding of the RHI scheme.\n\nOriginally from the village of Oranmore in Co Galway, the Ulster University graduate was also Sinn Fein assistant in the European Parliament before being appointed to the role, which came with a £63,736 salary.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"irelands president submits nomination papers as he seeks second term","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

said she is visiting Boston and Washington this week to build relationships at a “crucial time” as the UK Government aims to restore devolution in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Stormont Assembly in Belfast has been suspended since January 2017 when the then deputy first minister Martin McGuinness resigned amid disagreements between Sinn Fein and the DUP.\n\nSeveral attempts at talks to resurrect the power-sharing institutions have failed.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nCountryside near Castlederg, Co Tyrone, part of a former smuggling route covering both sides of

democratically accountable ministers to take important decisions on a wide range of issues,” she said.\n\n“That is my absolute priority and I am doing everything that I can to deliver devolved government as soon as possible.”\n\nDuring her visit to the US, Ms Bradley will meet senior politicians on Capitol Hill who have a strong interest in Northern Ireland.\n\nShe will hold bilateral meetings with political figures from the White House and State Department and ious members of Congress to update them on the UK Government’s priorities in Northern Ireland.\n\n\n\nThe UK Government’s

doing to restore an executive and help deliver a Brexit deal that avoids a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland and a border down the Irish Sea.\n\nIn a busy schedule, Ms Bradley is also set to deliver a keynote speech in Washington and undertake a series of high-level engagements with leaders from business and Irish-American civic society in Boston.\n\n“As Secretary of State, I aim to build on and deepen the unique relationship with key partners in the United States in this 20th anniversary year of the Belfast Agreement,” she said.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\"

implementation of the Agreement as we leave the European Union.\n\n“I look forward to meeting senior US politicians and policymakers to update them on my plan to enable a period where an executive can be appointed and formed, as well as setting out how the UK Government will ensure that Northern Ireland’s unique circumstances are protected and advanced in the months ahead.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more men now reaching their","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

to data from the Office for National Statistics .\n\nIn 2002, there were 8.22 women aged 100 years old or over for every man in the UK.\n\nLast year, there were 4.85 female centenarians to every male

group in 2002, compared to 2.05 in 2017.\n\nWhile women have higher le expectancy, fast improvements in death rates among men decades ago mean more are now living longer, the ONS said.\n\nThe number of centenarians decreased slightly between 2016 and 2017, the figures show.\n\nThere was a total of 14,430 people 100 years old or over last year, down from 14,510.\n\nThis corresponds with a sharp

continuing to see higher numbers of people aged 90 years and over in the UK due to improvements in mortality going back many decades.\n\n“While we have seen growing numbers of centenarians in recent years, there has been a slight decrease between 2016 and 2017.\n\n“This is due to lower numbers of births during World War One.\n\n“The number of centenarians is likely to increase again from 2019 in line with historic birth patterns.”\n\nIn 2017, there were 579,776 people aged 90 years and older living in the UK, the data shows.\n\nThe number is continuing to increase, despite a decline in births in England and Wales 90 years ago, which reflects historic improvements in death rates, the ONS said.\n\nAcross the UK, Wales has the highest proportion of centenarians at 26 per 100,000 people, followed by England at 22 and Scotland at 17.\n\nNorthern Ireland has the lowest at 15.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"shock as female labour deputy leader plans shelved","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo

Both agreed that the best solution to the Northern Ireland border would be found through an agreement on the future relationship, said Number 10.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"these sausages sound like theyre screaming for their lives","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

An IVA is a formal insolvency procedure and will have long lasting effects particularly when it comes to obtaining credit in the future. \n\nThere may be other ways of dealing with your debt problems which better suit your situation and your level of borrowing. \n\nIf you feel you are being pushed in the direction of an IVA without any alternative solutions being explored, you should be extremely wary. \n\nAny good debt adviser will take the time to understand your inidual situation and talk you through the ious options which may be open to you before recommending the most appropriate course of action. \n\n\nBe wary of false promises \n\nA common tactic employed by unscrupulous IVA companies is to tell you that they can wipe out a huge percentage of your current debts. \n\nWhile IVAs do often result in you paying back less than you borrowed, the actual amount you have to pay back is based on your inidual circumstances and the level of disposable income you have spare each month. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nThis can only be determined following a careful and considered examination of your finances and negotiations with your creditors. \n\nAlthough you may be tempted by these false promises, in reality it is much better to speak to an adviser who will tell you the truth about your situation. This approach will help you understand your options and choose the most appropriate solution for you. \n\n\nDo your research \n\nBefore signing on the dotted line, do your research into the IVA company. \n\nDo they have a physical office presence? \n\nHave you met, or been offered a face to face meeting with an adviser? \n\nAre they registered with the FCA? If you are having dficulty finding this information, have concerns that the company is not being fully honest about who they are, or  you have doubts over their credentials, don’t be afraid to walk away. \n\nAny reputable company will be happy to very who they are and provide details of the regulatory bodies they are part of including their FCA approval. \n\n\nWatch out for up-front fees \n\n\nFees are an unavoidable part of an IVA. \n\nEntering into an IVA will cost you money regardless of who you enter into the arrangement with. \n\nThis is because an insolvency practitioner  will be required to distribute your monthly payment between your creditors during the entire term of the IVA. \n\nHowever, the fees charged can y wildly from provider to provider and so can the manner in which the monthly charges are collected. These fees should already be factored into your agreed monthly payment amount you should not be charged an additional fee on top of this. \n\nIf your IVA provider asks you to pay them a separate amount to cover these costs it is likely you are being charged more for this service than you have to. \n\n\nIf you need proper debt advice, call Begbies Traynor on 028 90 918 200 or email at: \n[email\u0026#160protected]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"office building derrys riverfront placed market asking price region","story":"\nA prime office building on Strand Road in Derry has come to the market today, with offers expected in the region of £5.25m.\n\nTimber Quay is fully let to a strong tenant line up which includes AXA, Fujitsu, Click Energy, Kainos and Invest NI with a total rent of £644,190 per annum.\n\nThe property is a modern Grade A office space designed for professional companies seeking highly quality office accommodation.

However that didn\u0026rsquot faze him as he lined up in front of the live ITV4 cameras.\n\nHe stormed past championship leader Zamparelli on the opening lap to grab fourth place, before posting the fastest lap of the race sas he began to close in on the podium battle and pile the pressure on George Gamble ahead.\n\nSome robust defending from Gamble saw Harper forced onto the grass on a couple of occasions, but he was able to find his way past heading into Copse corner on the penultimate lap to take third position, which he held through to the finish.\n\nA time penalty for the driver ahead though ensured the Dromore High School student ended the weekend with a second place finish as part of a superb one-two-three finish for the JTR team, with the result putting Harper just one point shy of fourth in the championship standings.\n\nHarper said afterwards: \u0026ldquoI feel I\u0026rsquom really in my groove in the series now and I\u0026rsquom going to be giving it everything to try and continue our great pace and end the year in style at Brands Hatch GP, a circuit I love.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch woman’s invite to join charity Twilight Walk  ","story":"\t\t\t\nBALLYNAHINCH woman Rosalind Steenson is urging people to join her on the forthcoming Marie Curie Twilight Walk to raise funds for the leading cancer charity.\n\nThe event \u0026mdash which takes place on Friday, September 28 at 7.30pm \u0026mdash will be held in the beautul grounds of Barnett Demesne in South Belfast to raise funds for an organisation which provides care to people with a terminal illness in their own homes or in one of its nine hospices.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe charity is also a leader in research into the best ways of caring for people with a terminal illness and all the\u0026nbsp\n\nservices it provides are free of charge, with around 70% of its income coming via donations with the balance of funds provided by the NHS.\n\nThose taking part in the forthcoming Twilight Walk can expect much more than just a walk as there will be a festival atmosphere with music, entertainment and a spectacular firework display to finish off.\n\nPeople take part in the walk for all sorts of reasons, with a large proportion walking in memory of someone they have lost.\u0026nbsp\n\nRosalind will be remembering her best friend of over 30 years, Michelle Watterson, who died in the Marie Curie Hospice in Belfast in July.\n\n\u0026ldquoMichelle was diagnosed with cancer for the second time three years ago and, unfortunately, it spread to other parts of her body and became terminal, she explained.\n\n\u0026ldquoShe spent her final ten days at the hospice where she received exceptional care.

Even  you start out walking by yourself, you are never alone along the Camino.\n\nThe Camino Portugues, or the Portuguese Way, spans from Lisbon to Santiago de Compostela, the final destination being St James\u0026rsquo Church, where the body of St James is said to lay.\n\nIt travels through the province of Galicia in northern Spain, going through the cities of Porto and Pontevedra and along the coastline of Sanxenxo, the Cies Islands, and Baiona.\n\nWhile this Camino way was shorter that the more arduous Camino Del Norte throughout the northern Basque area of Spain, Edmund said that there were other challenges.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe biggest challenge was walking in extreme heat, said Edmund. \u0026ldquoIt was 38 degrees on one day but for the rest of the days it was around 28 degrees. Staying hydrated was also a challenge.\n\nEdmund also enjoys the feeling of having to travel from one hostel to another with just the bare basics, as he says it gives him an understanding of what le is like for those with transitory lestyles.\n\nHowever, he adds: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a great togetherness and camaraderie as everyone is doing it together.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"First look inside new £16m Down Leisure Centre with ‘wow factor’  ","story":"\t\t\t\nTHE new \u0026pound16m Down Leisure Centre, which opens its doors to the public in November, has the wow factor those closely involved in its design always promised it would have.\n\nWhile very much a community facility, the ultra-modern and futuristic three-storey building boasts a stunning range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels.\n\nWhile the finishing touches are being put to the 6,500 square metre, three-storey Market Street building, the Down Recorder was last week given a sneak preview of the stunning new centre that has been a long time coming.\u0026nbsp\n\nPlans for the new complex were first discussed well over a decade ago and despite raised eyebrows about building the centre in front of the ageing facility it will replace, everything has gone smoothly with council officials delighted they now have a leisure complex that will be the envy of many.\u0026nbsp\n\nThey are confident that once the centre opens its doors to the public, people will recognise the long wait for a new leisure complex has been worth it, with the new vitality suite on the top floor which boasts a sauna, steam room and small pool with its own mini fountain, particularly stunning.\n\nThe spacious and airy entrance foyer opens up to reveal two swimming pools, one of which has a moveable floor. There is a reception, lobby area and ground floor studio with Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos corporate colours a recurring theme throughout the building.\n\nThere are dedicated changing facilities on the ground floor with the pools designed for use by people of all abilities. The smaller of the two pools measures eight metres by 13, while the main 25-metre pool boats six lanes and electronic touch pads to time races.\n\nThroughout the building, every effort has been made to flood it with as much natural light as possible which helps provide the centre with its imposing look. A boccia court designed for use by disabled bowlers is also located on the ground floor, with this particular area also doubling up as a dance studio and multipurpose hall.\n\nCouncil officials have also revealed the new centre\u0026rsquos ground floor level is higher than the main road outside to protect the building from future flooding that may occur in this part of the town and which was a signicant problem a number of years ago.\n\nModern sound proofing techniques have been deployed throughout the building, particularly in the swimming pool and main hall areas. When the natural light fades,\u0026nbsp subtle, state-of-the-art LED lighting illuminates the building, adding to its unique character.\n\nMains gas was connected to the building which also boasts a combined heat and power source which helps minimise its carbon footprint with photovoltaic cells on the roof helping heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas. In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns into warm air.\n\nSo-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building on the ground floor, also reducing glare and preventing people from outside looking in.\n\nThere are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room \u0026mdash the new leisure complex\u0026rsquos nerve centre \u0026mdash resembling something akin to the interior of a futuristic space ship.\n\nThe impressive four court hall on the first floor can be used for a iety of sports, including badminton, basketball and five-a-side football. One of the walls has also been specially marked at the request of the Down Handball Club.\u0026nbsp\n\nAs with the ground floor swimming pools, there is also a dedicated viewing area over the main hall, while nearby there is a dedicated area for racquet ball and handball.\n\nA spin studio and multi-purpose area are also located on the second floor, with all music and sound systems built in and controlled from the main reception area.\n\nThe third floor boasts spectacular views across to Down Cathedral, the Dromara Hills, the Mournes and across Dunleath Park towards the Vianstown area.\n\nWhen not admiring the views, users can immerse themselves in getting fit or pampering themselves in the vitality suite. The third floor boasts an 85-station fitness suite and fitness room that can be hired by sports clubs to use. Council officials say the use of the top floor will evolve over time and has the capacity to respond to need.\n\nEach of the eight beams which hold the top floor in place weigh 35 tonnes and had to be put in place overnight as part of a military-style operation which involved heavy lting gear and went without a hitch.\n\nThe vitality area extenuates the wow factor, featuring a relaxation pool alongside steam and sauna rooms, with the careful attention to detail in the design process accentuating this particular area where people can relax and unwind. There is also a dedicated lt to take people from the swimming pool area directly to the top floor.\n\nCouncil director Michael Lipsett said the new leisure centre was top of his in-tray when he joined the local authority eight years ago.\n\nSince then, he has attended countless meetings to propel the scheme forward and is delighted ratepayers will soon have an opportunity to use a centre which the district can be justiably be very proud of.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe long wait has been worth it and this is a fantastic building which I have no doubt people will appreciate and enjoy. It will also be a pleasure for our leisure staff to move to a modern building.\n\nMr Lipsett added: \u0026ldquoI have watched the building grow from the drawing board and to finally see it nearly complete is really something else. Everyone associated with the building, from the designers to the builders and the councillors who supported it financially deserve credit.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTheir collective efforts have produced a magnicent building that would not be out of place in the private sector. That\u0026rsquos how good this building is.\n\nOnce staff move in and the old leisure complex has been decommissioned, it will be bulldozed to provide a major new car park at the rear. Ahead of the opening, council officials plan to organise a series of visits to provide the public with a glimpse of the spectacular new 21st century leisure centre.\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 19%2C 1978  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Downpatrick\u0026rsquos old town hall is to be turned into a training centre for out of work teenagers in an exciting \u0026pound500,000 initiative to combat the district\u0026rsquos growing youth unemployment problem.\n\nWork has already begun on clearing the hall and the centre is to expected to be fully operational by January next year with room for up to 30 trainees. Organised by a newly named community group \u0026mdash Lecale Training Workshops Ltd \u0026mdash the scheme will cater for young people between the ages of 16 and 19.\n\nLatest unemployment figures put the total number out of work in that age group in Down district at almost 500. The aim\u0026nbsp\n\nbehind the new centre is to give them work experience and provide them with basic skills in a iety of jobs.\n\nThe idea for the new community group is the brainchild of Mr Bill Hampton, of Down District Trades Union Council. Lending a hand is Downpatrick man Mr Malachi Curran, who is head of the Department of Manpower Services in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe whole idea has ben introduced to help young people who have been unemployed to prepare for work, Mr Curran said. \u0026ldquoIt isn\u0026rsquot an apprenticeship, but rather is aimed at teaching them basic skills and perhaps helping them choose the type of career they want to follow.\n\nMr Curran said that they hoped to be able to put anything up to 250 young people through the course inside five years.\n\nCLOUGH \u0026mdash The death toll on a road outside Clough climbed to five in three years when a young motorcyclist was killed on Sunday. He was 19 year-old Andrew Stephen Martin, of Ascot Park in Belfast.\n\nMr Martin was involved in a head-on collision with a car at a spot known as the Rectory on the Ballykinlar-Clough Road. The accident happened at approximately 2pm and Mr Martin died about two hours later in Downe Hospital.\n\nThe driver of the car, who was a soldier based at Ballykinlar camp, was taken to the Downe, but was later transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast suffering from severe facial injuries.\n\nMr Frank Greeves, a local lorry driver, told the Recorder that it one of the most dangerous bends he had ever seen. He asked: \u0026ldquoHow many more lives have to be lost before something is done?\n\nA DoE spokesman said there were no plans to carry out work on the road.\n\nSTRANGFORD \u0026mdash A party of 130 mentally and physically handicapped children and young adults went cruising on Strangford Lough free of charge on Tuesday \u0026mdash courtesy of the Downpatrick Division of the DoE Roads Service.\n\nThe group\u0026rsquo aged between 12 and 25, came from the Downpatrick area and were accompanied by parents and volunteers. They left Strangford in the morning on the MV Portaferry to explore wildle and points of interest on the lough.\n\nThe idea of the cruise originated with the staff of the Downpatrick Roads Division who realised that the ferry \u0026mdash often used for educational and pleasure cruises by many groups \u0026mdash was also ideally suited for use by handicapped people because of its ramps and high sides.\n\nThe crew for the outing worked their rest day without payment and the other overheads for running the boat were written off by the DoE as normal test running. Ready Mix concrete stepped in to provide refreshments.\n\nMr Ray Carter, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister with responsibility for the DoE, was there to see the children off on their cruise.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis a fine and warming gesture by the crews of the ferries to give up their free time. I know to look at the happy faces around me that their kindness is very well received.\n\nKILLYLEAGH \u0026mdash A scheme to turn Killyleagh harbour into a boat and leisure centre has proved to be the straw which broke the back of a group of local residents. Already 104 residents have signed a petition against the scheme which has received outline planning permission.\n\nPut forward by Mr Robert Morrow, a local coal merchant and businessman, it sets out his hopes to construct pontoon jetties, a clubhouse, toilet block, bar, restaurant, chandlery, workshop and car parking spaces.\n\nThe residents, while believing that there is an urgent need for the harbour to be brought up to an acceptable standard, feel that the scheme falls short of that is required and that it is likely to have a \u0026ldquomost undesirable impact on the residential area surrounding the site.\n\nRATHMULLAN \u0026mdash The Rathmullan Mound is to stay \u0026mdash or at least the best part of it is. After four months of intensive archaeological digging, experts have ruled that the Mound is too valuable to be removed, though they have taken away the top section.\n\nBut although the Department of the environment has put a protection order on the site it will not be taking the Mound into public ownership in the way it has done with other ancient monuments.\n\nThat decision is expected to anger local historians and Down councillors, who have been battling to save the monument from demolition and who have called for it to be taken into public charge.\n\nThe Mound is a rath dating back to early Christian times, with evidence of five dferent settlements from 700 AD to the 16th century. The top section, which is Norman, has been removed, though all of the archaeologist\u0026rsquos findings have been carefully preserved.\n\nOne of the most exciting discoveries was a large souterrain, or underground passage. This 1,000 year-old chamber was used by early inhabitants of the area and is still as perfect in parts as it was when it was first built.\n\nBALLYGOWAN \u0026mdash Female wrestling comes to Ballygowan in a big way tonight when Blackfoot Sue takes the ring at The Squire\u0026rsquos Inn.\n\nThe shapely wrestler from the USA gets to grips with another lady grappler, Manchester\u0026rsquos Miss Lena. The bout is sure to be the star attraction at this initial venture by the Ballygowan night spot.\n\nBut several other star bouts are on the programme, including world middleweight champion Adrian Street, Prince Jitsu and Bruce McDonald.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash Hugh Duggan, the newly appointed progressional at Ardglass Golf Club, took up his position at the seaside club on Monday. Twenty four year-old Hugh, formerly attached to Kirkistown Castle Golf Club, becomes only the second professional golfer appointed to the club in its 84-year history.\n\nHis appointment, combined with many other improvements both on and off the course, has made Ardglass one of the most progressive clubs in Co Down.\n\nBALLYNAHINCH \u0026mdash Ballynahinch piper Ian Jess took second place in the All-Ireland solo piping championships at Banbridge Technical College on Saturday.\n\nIan was placed second in the march section and third in the reel and strathspey section, but had to be content to finish runner-up behind Tom Anderson, from Dublin.\n\nIan is tutored by Joe McAdam, the pipe major at Ballynahinch, and is now regarded as one of the best pipers in the country.\n\nKILMORE \u0026mdash A former pupil of Down High School has obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Lancaster. He is John James McIlhone, from Kilmore, Crossgar, who graduated with a second class honours BA ision one in history.\n\nIn the junior section Richard Parkes, of Field Marshal Montgomery, came out on top.\n\nSAINTFIELD \u0026mdash A woman was taken to hospital on Saturday night after two cars were involved in an accident on the Crossgar Road, Saintfield.

This was the product of gathering together his late father\u0026rsquos copious notes on the history of the town.\n\nThe society\u0026rsquos other founding members included Mr Robert Brown, an agent for Dunleath Estates who was treasurer, Down County Council official Mr Robert Maxwell, who was secretary, and the Rev John Radclfe, who was chairman.\n\nOther society members included other local clergy, headmasters, representatives of professions and local businesses and iniduals who were interested in local history.\n\nThe first meeting took place in Denvir\u0026rsquos Hotel where it continued to meet every month for several decades. At this meeting the objects of the Society were outlined \u0026ndash to encourage and foster interest in the history and traditions of Downpatrick and County Down, music, arts and sciences and the architecture of buildings and monuments of historic or artistic value in the area.\n\nThe following day\u0026rsquos Down Recorder reported that Mr Parkinson gave the first lecture of The Downe Society, fittingly on the subject, The Story of Downpatrick, in which he spoke about man reaching Ireland some seven thousand years ago, through to the ravages of the Norsemen, De Courcy and the Normans, the Fitzgeralds, Cromwells, Southwells and into the eighteen century.\u0026nbsp\n\nHis closing words were on the urban administration of the day with a sense of the historic past and the hope of future well-being.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn 1948, the formation of the Society was a signicant attempt to bring together people from all sections of the community, particularly across the religious ide. Both The Downe Society, and its later partner, the Lecale Historical Society, maintained a proud non-sectarian record.\u0026nbsp\n\nOver the years, the society hosted many outstanding speakers including a Lord Chief Justice, local author Lynn C.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, dficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a  for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully ing calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

them.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMrs Foster was enterprise minister when the flawed RHI scheme was being designed.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nControls to limit the scheme’s costs were not introduced and overly generous subsidies saw the taxpayer bill spike dramatically.\n\nMrs Foster has contested claims by a successor minister, former party colleague Jonathan

Singapore or Rotterdam after Brexit, a business leader has said.\n\n                \nTina McKenzie called for the country to be granted “free port” status, meaning all the UK’s trade would be processed through Northern Ireland to avoid the imposition of customs duties.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA backstop option under negotiation between the UK and EU has been interpreted by Europe to mean Northern Ireland following the bloc’s regulations after the orce in exchange for maintaining an open Irish border.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMs McKenzie said: “We can make all the trade for the British Isles via Europe come through Northern Ireland.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“It does not physically have to come through Northern Ireland but it is all processed and traded through Northern Ireland.\n\n“In that instance we could become like the Singapore of the western hemisphere.”\n\nShe is chief executive of recruitment companies which operate in Northern Ireland and the Republic and is policy chairwoman of the Federation of Small Businesses  in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn Northern Ireland small firms employ more than big business and the public sector put together, and Brexit is crucial.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMs McKenzie added: “For us any impact on small business would be very detrimental to the economy.”\n\nShe warned of the effect of a hard Irish border on political stability as well as on the impoverished and those on benefits.\n\n“The marginalised communities need those jobs that a hard Brexit impacting the economy could take away.”\n\nShe has suggested to all political parties the idea of creating a free port.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“That would be transformational for this society, whether you are a unionist, nationalist or neither.\n\n“A good, prosperous Northern Ireland is good for the nationalist cause  they want the Republic of Ireland to vote to have Northern Ireland within the island.\n\n“It is also really good from a unionist perspective because the happier people are in a Northern Ireland, the more prosperous, the less likely they are to want to change the constitutional position.\n\n“So for us it is a no-brainer, it is good for everybody and there is not any party or government that sees that as a threat.”\n\nShe said it also solved Great Britain’s problem of getting trade in through a friendly port, therefore without worrying about dferent customs imposed at the other side.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“They have more control, I guess, with Northern Ireland being part of the UK.\n\n“There is some technical detail to work on but everyone we have floated it with has really been, even people you might be surprised, have been quite open to the idea.\n\n“People seem content enough with it and are asking about how the mechanics might work.”\n\nShe admitted the technicalities still had to be resolved.\n\n“JFK got into office and said in this decade we will have a man on the moon. He was not able to tell them how he was going to get the man on the moon.”\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n

We are absolutely delighted with the set-up here, and last year for us was just unbelievable. This has given us the space to not only expand the products which were on offer last year but to incorporate new leisure pursuits such as fishing. I’m sure the fishing lake will be a great attraction in the new hall this year with the opportunity for the public to try their hand at casting. We also have more boats, more cycles and more outdoor gear on display with both Decathlon and Go Outdoors coming onboard. The thing we love about the Leisure Show is that local businesses come together and work as a team - I think it is just brilliant.’’\n\nBilly also delightedly announced that renowned chef Paula McIntyre will be at the show for three days with three demonstrations per day.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nShow sponsors including Downtown Radio and main sponsor, Calor NI\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaula enthused: ‘‘I’m delighted to be involved. Confined cooking facilities needn’t be a barrier to delicious food. \n\n‘‘I’ll be using the best of local ingredients to cook up dishes that can be prepared on a couple of rings or butane camper stove, I have first-hand experience of cooking in a campervan so it’ll be great to be able to show what can be done to the wider audience!’’\n\nWith a launch which included an eye-popping somersaulting spectacle from the Go-Fyt Warriors, who will be hosting a fun-fuelled challenge on the day suitable for all ages, this year’s show promises to provide all-round entertainment for the entire family. Representative Kevin Howlette said: ‘‘We’re delighted to have Go-Fyt Warrior here in a series of races and challenges for you all to become NI Warriors. Once you enter our ninja challenge your le will never be the same again.’’\n\nThe family-friendly event, which this year will also host a new dog show, will also boast refreshments, entertainment and camping packages - and is offering trips to local shopping centres for those wanting to make the most out of their weekend. Billy added: ‘‘Last year we were happy to welcome members of the Caravan Club and Motorhome Owners Club to stay with us in Balmoral Park for the weekend.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that this year this arrangement will continue and will be extended to members of the Republic of Ireland branches of these clubs. We plan to have over 500 units camping with us over that weekend with something for all to see and do. For three nights stay plus three days admission, including a shuttle service into Lisburn city centre and Sprucefield on Friday and Saturday morning with entertainment on Saturday evening altogether for £20 / euros and £15 / euros for OAPs.’’ A free shuttle transfer service will also operate from Lisburn Railway Station to the show site at Balmoral Park.\n\nCalor’s Andrew Sands, Cylinder Sales Rep, added they can’t wait to : ‘‘Calor has been operating now for over 80 years across Northern and Republic of Ireland. When we exhibited at last year’s show, we were blown away by its success and the interest we received for Calor products.’’ Calor NI Leisure Show will run on Friday, November 2 from 2pm - 10pm and Saturday and Sunday, November 3 and 4 from 10am until 5pm.\n\n\nTickets and online\n\nVisit: \nnileisure\n and Like the NI Leisure Show Facebook page at: \nfacebook/N.I.LeisureShow\n for updates.\n

Zealand and France. Whisked egg whites and very little flour make them wonderfully light, and the ground almonds make them really moist. Traditionally they\u0026#8217re small cakes, but here I tip the batter into a baking dish and cook it whole,\" explains chef Yotam Ottolenghi.\n\n                \n\"You can make the batter well in advance here,  you want to get ahead – it keeps well in the fridge up to a day ahead – but don’t macerate the fruit for this amount of time as it will become too juicy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Serve with custard, vanilla ice cream or cream. The fruit can be played around with, depending on the season,\" he adds. \"Raspberries and peaches can be used in the early summer months, for example.\"\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHOW TO MAKE YOTAM OTTOLENGHI’S PLUM, BLACKBERRY AND BAY\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nFRIAND BAKE...\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Place the blackberries and plums in a bowl with the vanilla extract, sugar, bay leaves and half a teaspoon of cinnamon. Set aside for 30 minutes. Don’t be tempted to leave them sitting around for longer than this, as the fruit will become too juicy.\n\n2. Preheat the oven to 190°C fan.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n3. Mix the flour, icing sugar, ground almonds, the remaininghalf a teaspoon cinnamon and salt in a separate large bowl. Set aside.\n\n4. Lightly whisk the egg whites by hand for 30 seconds, so they just start to froth. Stir into the flour mixture, along with the melted butter, until combined.\n\n5. Tip the batter into a 20 x 30cm parchment-lined baking dish and top evenly with the fruit and juices. Bake for 40 minutes, covering the dish with foil for the final 10 minutes, until the batter is golden-brown and the fruit is bubbling. Set aside for 10 minutes before serving.\n\nOttolenghi Simple by Yotam Ottolenghi with Tara Wigley and Esme Howarth, photography by Jonathan Lovekin, is published by Ebury Press, priced £25.

case, should not only have been on the Commonwealth team but should have captained it.\n\n                \nThat is the view of the former head coach of the Sandy Row fighter’s west Belfast boxing club, Michael Hawkins.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe Equality Commission said that Lewis had trained at two clubs which would have been perceived as being Protestant, before moving to one in the heart of republican west Belfast.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt was there, Holy Trinity Boxing Club, he trained for the Commonwealth squad as part of his failed bid to make the five-man team.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nHe was not selected, and believes everyone selected was Catholic.\n\nHe took a court case against the selection body, the Ulster Boxing Council, and has now settled out of court for £8,500 .\n\nHoly Trinity’s head coach Mr Hawkins told the News Letter that not only should Lewis have been on the Commonwealth squad, but that “without a doubt he was the man – he was to captain the team”.\n\nMr Hawkins, in his early 60s, is not convinced that sectarianism lay behind the decision not to pick Lewis and could not be sure what the motivation was.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBut whatever the reason, he said Lewis was “wrongly done by, without a doubt”.\n\n“He’s received some money, which doesn’t solve everything,” he said.\n\n“They’ll never repay him for the experience, or for the hurt that’s gone on.”\n\nHe indicated there has been a change of personnel at the Ulster Boxing  Council  since 2015.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWhen it comes to the way it selects boxers from now on, he said: “It should be named the Crocker Criteria. \n\n“Then people will ask: ‘why the Crocker criteria?’ – and let it be told.”\n\nMr Hawkins hails from a nationalist/Catholic background in the west of the city, but stressed sport is what matters and community background does not come into it.\n\nHe added: “The best boxer, the best man, has to go – regardless of who he is or what he is. Lewis’ daddy Ricky said the same thing –  it doesn’t happen again, at least something concrete has come out of it.”\n\nLewis himself said he had chosen Holy Trinity because it was “the best club without a doubt”, and that he “definitely” did not come across sectarianism whilst there.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n

Remain or Leave in the referendum \u0026#8211 have consistently opposed an Irish Sea border, \u0026#8216special status\u0026#8217 for Northern Ireland or any other form of words that means Brussels retains effective control over this part of the UK. \n\n                \nNow that the negotiations are in their final weeks, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has at last dropped these provocative terms in favour of reassuring language about technical checks, supposedly designed to protect the single market. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThis does not mean that the constitutional threat has passed, even though the prime minister made an admirably direct statement on Friday, effectively advising EU leaders to mind their manners and stop trying to break up her country. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe EU may present its proposals in a more artful way, but it still insists Northern Ireland must stay in the single market and customs union, even while the rest of the UK leaves. It intends to drive a wedge between our economy and its largest market, in Great Britain, while our rules and tarf regime would be determined by Brussels, rather than London.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nFor months, Barnier has talked about ‘de-dramatising’ the prospect of an internal-UK, Irish Sea border and ‘improving’ the EU’s interpretation of the ‘backstop’ that is supposed to guarantee a soft border on the island of Ireland. Last week, we discovered more about this “revised draft of the Northern Ireland protocol” and what it might involve.    \n\nInitially, the details were greeted with excitement, even by some Brexiteers. The EU seemed to acknowledge that it was possible to create a hi-tech, unobtrusive border, of the type that has long been advocated by Leavers.\n\nYet, it soon became apparent that these technological solutions were intended to operate between Great Britain and the island of Ireland, rather than Northern Ireland and the Republic.\n\nWhy does any of this matter? Most of our lives wouldn’t be affected by officials scanning barcodes on freight at ports and on ferries, or companies having to fill in a few extra forms.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt matters because the checks are not the decisive thing. \n\nIf Northern Ireland takes its rules from the EU, while the rest of the UK leaves, and  its customs regime is tied to the EU, while Great Britain makes its own decisions, our economies will erge and in turn our societies and our politics will move further apart.\n\nThis won’t happen next April, because, initially, regulations and tarfs are unlikely to change, but it will have a profound effect over years and decades. It’s not melodramatic to state that it may mean the beginning of the end for Northern Ireland and the Union.      \n\nThat’s why nationalists and the Republic’s government have been so enthusiastic about an Irish Sea border.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe idea that Leo Varadkar is merely promoting his country’s best interests is nonsense. The Republic’s economy is far more dependent on trade with Great Britain than Northern Ireland. Rather than focus on keeping goods flowing freely across the Irish Sea, Varadkar has chosen quite deliberately to challenge British sovereignty in Northern Ireland. \n\nHe and Barnier are attacking the very essence of the Union and the ‘principle of consent’ that secures Northern Ireland’s place within it.\n\nThey want to deny the UK the right to govern an integral part of its territory and they want to deprive people in Northern Ireland of the right, as British citizens, to participate in the politics, decision-making and economic le of their country.           \n\nThe UK government is terried of offending Irish nationalist sensibilities, so it has responded mostly by mollying Dublin, which has been interpreted as a sign of weakness. \n\nConsequently, in Salzburg last week, EU leaders rudely rejected the prime minister’s Chequers plan out of hand. In turn, she rebuffed Mr Barnier’s ideas and spoke strongly about the unacceptability of an internal UK customs frontier.  \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMay is less forthright about a regulatory border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, though, on Friday, she insisted that the devolved institutions would have to agree to any ergence. \n\nThe government intends to draw up yet another set of proposals that preserve these principles, in the hope that it might find common ground with the EU. Yet, alarmingly,  the Assembly were restored, an anti-Union coalition of Irish nationalists and the place-apartists of Alliance already have a slim majority in favour of loosening ties with the rest of the UK. \n\nMany knowledgeable pro-Union, pro-Brexit voices are convinced that, in the end, acceptable arrangements will be agreed. Viewed from this side of the Irish Sea, their equanimity is less reassuring. \n\nUltimately, the prime minister relies upon a ‘confidence and supply’ deal to prop up her Conservative administration and, in theory, the DUP could always withdraw support  she agreed to treat Northern Ireland dferently. But is it possible that Arlene Foster and Co might be tempted to trade their votes,  they were offered enough inducements? \n\nIf the EU continues with its current intransigence and Theresa May softens her latest statement on the border, it could come down to whether the DUP’s unionism is based on Northern Ireland’s full participation in the political, cultural and economic le of the UK, or whether it’s an Ulsterist charade, that has more to do with flags, Orange marches and the Stormont pork barrel. \n\nIt’s hardly a comforting bulwark against the most serious assault on our constitutional status since the Anglo-Irish Agreement.\n\n\n• Alex Kane is away\n\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\nCookie Settings\n\n\n\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp

his honour were in the process of being planned.\n\nThe entertainer\u0027s son, Thomas, described the unveiling of the bronze statue of his father as a celebratory moment, tinged with sadness.\n\nThe Co Monaghan town centre was packed on Sunday with over a thousand fans travelling from across Ireland and further afield.\n\nThere were cheers as Mr Higgins unveiled the statue, before a rush of fans eager to see it up close and get their photo taken with it.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThomas told those assembled that his family were devastated his mother Rose, who also died earlier this year, as well as his father were not there to see it.\n\n\"The main focus of my few words is to give thanks, and we have many people to thank for making this day possible,\" he said.\n\n\"This day is a very proud day for the McBride family, celebratory yet tinted with sadness, for they have departed, Mum and Dad.\n\n\"We are devastated that Mum and Dad aren\u0027t here today, I know they would have loved it.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Thank you all.\"\n\nBig Tom and the Mainliners were formed in the 1960s and achieved widespread success.\n\nHenry McMahon, another member of the Mainliners, also described it as a day tinged with sadness.\n\n\"It\u0027s a wonderful day, tinged with sadness, but it\u0027s no less than Big Tom deserves, he was an icon, and still is an icon,\" he told the Press Association.\n\nUK-based sculptor Mark Richards said he had never seen a crowd like it, in the unveiling of all the pieces he has worked on.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe explained initially he had considered a sculpture of Big Tom on stage performing, but later decided on the sitting pose without the microphone in front of him, like a \"barrier\" between him and his fans.\n\nThat option was chosen by the family who felt it best reflected Tom\u0027s approachability and \"man of the people\" persona.\n\nAmong the fans in attendance were Richard and Marian Phillips from Co Kildare.\n\n\"I have been following Big Tom since 1971, he had a lovely manner, very natural, very down to earth, everyone was his friend,\" said Mr Phillips, who was wearing a Big Tom T-shirt.\n\nMyles Kavanagh had travelled from Kilkenny and dressed as Elvis for the occasion.\n\n\"It\u0027s magnicent, Big Tom would be proud of us all, Big Tom was the king of country, I may be the king of rock\u0027n\u0027roll but he was the king of country, we\u0027ll always have Big Tom in our memories,\" he said.\n\n\"He was so kind, he brought so much happiness to people with his music and he was a gentleman on and off the stage.\"\n\nThe unveiling came during the inaugural Castleblayney Celebrates Big Tom Festival, which opened on Culture Night and continued across the weekend.\n\nMcBride\u0027s career spanned more than five decades, culminating in his induction into the Irish Country Music Awards Hall of Fame in June 2016.\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n                                                          \n    \n                      \n\n    \n\n
