You got this, but it still was not enough. DAILY BRIEFING: Britain and the EU \u0027must allow contracts to...Bank branch staff help stop £25m worth of fraud thanks to...Dixons Carphone posts profits plunge in wake of major cyber...Share this articleHow to choose the best (and cheapest) DIY investing Isa - and our pick of the platformsPayPal\u0027s next demand was for a \u0027seizure document\u0027 from Trading Standards or the police. This would guarantee a refund, you were promised. You arranged this with your local authority\u0027s Trading Standards Office in Milton Keynes and told PayPal, but the next day you received an email saying this was again not enough. Worse was to come. The left hand at PayPal then started disagreeing with the right hand.  While one person at the company was insisting that you return the fake watch to the seller, another was telling you to keep it as evidence it was counterfeit. As I pointed out to PayPal, if the seller was indeed a crook, he would likely deny ever having received the watch if you returned it. Or, he could claim that the watch you returned was not the same as the watch he supplied. Either way, you would then be without both the watch and the £9,000.A final twist in the tale came when Trading Standards pointed out that as Rolex had confirmed the watch was a fake, if PayPal released your money to the fraudster, this could be regarded as money laundering, which is an offence in itself. I asked officials at PayPal to look into all of this. It told me: \u0027We never ask a buyer to return goods when we have been given proof they were counterfeit.\u0027It said it received that proof from Trading Standards on May 30. Now, I am not sure what proof that was exactly since I have seen a statement sent to PayPal by Trading Standards as long ago as March 26. It confirmed Rolex itself had judged the watch to be a fake. No matter, though. The important thing is that PayPal has now refunded the £9,000 back to the credit card you used. It has also made a goodwill credit of £100 to your PayPal account. Perhaps it might be best to avoid buying expensive second-hand watches.Why have my tax letters been ignored for months?S.T. writes: My tax office asked me to obtain official confirmation from the Department for Work \u0026amp Pensions showing the amount of my state pension for the tax years 2016-17 and 2017-18. I wrote to the department, giving my own calculations, but received no reply. I wrote again a month later and then again a month after that. But I still received no reply. A month later I submitted a written complaint, but I received no reply to this either. I am 83 years old and can do without these problems.Tony Hetherington replies: It really is frustrating to have one Government department asking you to get information from another one, only to find that the second department simply ignores you, even when you complain.You contacted the DWP in Wolverhampton, so I asked officials at its head office in London what had gone wrong. They told me they regret that you were ignored for four months, but failed to explain why. They have assured me you now have a written answer confirming that the pension figures held by your tax office are correct.

I telephoned but was fobbed off by a rude employee who told me it was not possible to contact customer services by phone because, \u0027Who would want to listen to that all day? Anyone can make up a plausible story.\u0027Tony Hetherington replies: Ryanair was concerned at the way you were treated when you called. I have given the airline the contact number you rang so this can be investigated. As for your refund Ryanair agrees you cancelled your flight and requested a refund, but it says you were asked to complete a claim form and failed to do this. You have told me that you submitted the claim form at least three times along with a copy of a doctor\u0027s note about your husband\u0027s illness. After I asked the airline to look into this, it emailed you to say the refund would go ahead. You have now received £233.I never agreed to be guarantor on policyM.H. writes: My son was learning to drive and was insured on a learner policy with Adrian Flux Insurance Services. I was paying monthly for this, and part of the policy was that it would be cancelled once he passed his test. He did pass and the policy was cancelled, but when he took out a new policy he found he could not have a monthly payment plan as he is only 17. Adrian Flux then put me down as guarantor and opened a finance agreement in my name, without my signature or consent. It says they are allowed to do this, but is it legal?Tony Hetherington replies: The answer of course is no. You cannot be held to a finance agreement that you never authorised. But you told me that when you protested to Adrian Flux, you were informed that the Financial Conduct Authority was aware of this practice, and if you cancelled the cover it would cost £486.I do not believe the regulator would ever accept this, but it does not matter now as the insurer has told me there has been \u0027a simple misunderstanding\u0027. It seems that when your son took out his new policy, your details were mistakenly transferred over from the old policy. The company told me that naming you as \u0027guarantor\u0027 was \u0027incorrect and a human error\u0027. The agreement has been scrapped and Adrian Flux has made a goodwill offer which you have accepted. If you believe you are the victim of financial wrongdoing, write to Tony Hetherington at Financial Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TS or email tony.hetherington@mailonsunday.co.uk.

They tend to be more energy-efficient, too, so you could benefit from lower utility bills.If you buy off-plan, you might be able to choose your fixtures and finishes, and of course there’s no upward chain to contend with when you buy a new-build.About 145,000 new homes have been bought so far using the Government’s Help To Buy equity loan and London Help To Buy schemes.But new-builds can also appeal to existing homeowners. Some house-builders, such as Bellway, run part-exchange schemes, which allow people to buy a new-build and use their current home as part payment. Bellway also offer Help To Buy, plus an ‘express mover scheme’ in which they work with a local agent to market your property. While you agree the selling price on your existing home, Bellway chase the agent to encourage them to find a buyer as quickly as possible and also pay the estate agents’ fee.At The Boiler House, which was completed this month and is part of the huge Old Vinyl Factory conversion in Hayes, West London, the developer, HUB, is offering to pay the stamp duty on the new-build homes for sale.          For a start, new-build homes come with a ten-year National House-Building Council warranty covering structural defects. Most developers also provide their own two-year warranty (stock image)The Boiler House consists of 54 studio, one- and two-bedroom homes and has rooftop allotments for residents to grow their own vegetables and plants. The £250 million Old Vinyl Factory development is regenerating a 17-acre former EMI site that produced records until the late 1970s.Other kinds of new-builds gaining popularity include homes in garden villages, where sustainability is key and green spaces are a priority.Crest Nicholson Strategic Projects are behind garden villages at Monksmoor Park in Northamptonshire, Tadpole Garden Village in Wiltshire and Kilnwood Vale in West Sussex.Public space is a large feature of garden villages and homeowners pay an annual service charge to fund its maintenance.Chris Tanner moved to Tadpole Garden Village in June 2016. ‘The fact that community engagement has been made a priority is the icing on the cake,’ he says. ‘We get to guide and shape our own community.’ Today, Chris helps organise community events at the garden village, from wildlife walks and meet-your-neighbour get-togethers to Christmas carols and Easter egg hunts. ‘The events are really important in helping us feel a strong sense of community,’ he says. ‘They offer a chance to get to know each other and what’s planned for the development. Everyone feels a part of it and in turn we’re proud of where we live.’  In with the new... and the oldAs the Old Vinyl Factory development at Hayes in West London shows, new-builds don’t have to be devoid of history. Pristine new flats can be on the site of – or even housed in – buildings of historic significance.First-time buyer Wahab Ahmed, 28, an analyst in the City, feels he has the best of both worlds: a new flat he bought off-plan but within the Royal Arsenal Riverside development in Woolwich, South-East London, which has 20 converted listed buildings, some dating from the 17th Century.The Royal Arsenal was a huge area used for weapons manufacturing that grew on the south bank of the Thames over centuries. ‘It’s steeped in history and the mix of old and new really makes it stand out,’ says Wahab. He had been renting in Hoxton and Shoreditch in East London before buying his first property in Royal Arsenal Riverside’s Cannon Square, above the new Crossrail station.He says: ‘Each time I thought I’d found somewhere, something would make me doubt I was making the right decision.‘As soon as I stepped foot on the Royal Arsenal Riverside development, I knew this was the right place for me.‘One of the main reasons I bought my home was to be close to the River Thames – for me it’s the heartbeat of London.‘Waking up each day to see the sun rise over the Thames, and to see it set at night, really is something special.’Wahab’s two-bedroom property is on the second floor of the Naval House building. He has a spare room for his brother and the property has a terrace that stretches the length of the flat.          Royal Arsenal Riverside will be home to one of only two Crossrail stations south of the river once the line opensRoyal Arsenal Riverside will be home to one of only two Crossrail stations south of the river once the line opens. Wahab believes Crossrail will have major economic benefits for everyone in the area.‘The development is already really well connected, but I think Crossrail will bring even more businesses, shops and bars to Woolwich. It feels the perfect time to move here as I get to see the area change and grow.’Alongside existing rail links and the DLR, the Thames Clipper provides another way to travel through London, with the O2 arena only an eight-minute boat ride away. City Airport is just two stops on the DLR.Wahab adds: ‘Unlike my previous rented properties, this home is more sustainable and my bills are considerably lower. It’s also very low-maintenance, which is what I was looking for from the start.’          Wahab (pictured) believes Crossrail will have major economic benefits for everyone in the area  ‘I wish I’d been taught that in school’ is a refrain many of us repeat time and again over the course of our lives.Since 86 per cent of us want to buy a home – and for everyone who does, there has to be a first time – purchasing a property is likely to be high on the list of topics that many wish had been on the curriculum when we were younger.Well, for everyone daunted by expressions such as ‘completion date’ and ‘exchanging contracts’ – and which order they come in – estate agent Yopa has produced an advice guide to talk property virgins through those tricky first stages, where everything seems like a step into the unknown.1 GET YOUR MONEY IN ORDERIt is likely you will need both a deposit and a mortgage, so try to build up as much as you can for your deposit, maybe asking your family for help. The mortgage you can get will depend on how much you earn, so have your bank statements – and details of other financial affairs – to hand.2 CHOOSE YOUR NO 1When you know how much a mortgage lender will give you and what you can afford to pay, settle on a property and view it more than once – during rush hour, during the evening, and during the school run. Get a surveyor’s report done if you’re unsure about anything.3 MAKE A SENSIBLE OFFERMake an offer – and offer what you think it’s worth, not what the owner believes it’s worth. Check similar properties in the area to make sure that you’re in the right ball park.4 SPREAD THE WORDTell the agent your offer, but don’t worry too much – it can be altered later. It’s not set in stone until you pay your initial deposit and exchange contracts.5 SIT BACK AND WAITVendors can take a long time to respond to your offer, but should normally come back within two working days.6 GET A SURVEYOR AND A LAWYERIf your offer is accepted, find a surveyor as soon as possible. If the surveyor’s report is acceptable, move on to what’s called conveyancing – the legal transfer of the property from one owner to another.7 LET THE WHEELS TURNDeal with the contracts for the purchase, and the disbursements (such as the cost to register your name against the title). Or rather, let your legal representative do it for you.8 EXCHANGE CONTRACTSPaying the initial deposit and exchanging contracts commits you to moving into the property. There’s no going back now.9 COMPLETE THE DEALCompletion day is when you transfer the remainder of the money and pick up the keys to your new property. Try not to make it the same day as when you exchange. A little breathing space is advisable.10 TIME TO MOVE ITIt’s all yours. Now the fun begins: transferring the utilities, registering for council tax, redirecting your mail, changing your address…"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/18/4D8F373E00000578-5877885-image-a-2_1529776158512.jpg","title":"Turn humble home hot property Kirstie Phils home makeover","story":"    Dream team: Kirstie Allsopp and Phil SpencerKirstie is keen not to over-promise on what’s realistic when selling a house. She says: ‘It’s a percentage game. You have to ask yourself honestly, “Did you overpay in the first place? Is the property still in the good condition it was in when you bought it?”’ She also says: ‘You need to know the state of the market. If the Queen put in bi-fold doors on the back kitchen of Buckingham Palace, would it increase in value by ten per cent? No. But if you take the average family house with a narrow old-style kitchen, sitting room and dining room, classic semi-detached style, and you knock down a wall and put in bi-fold doors and a family kitchen then, yes, it will add ten per cent. I’ve no fear in saying that.’Be careful to consider the state of the whole house though, if your budget is limited. ‘If something big needs fixing, such as the roof needs replacing, then do it. But let’s say Granny dies and her whole house is just very dated. There’s no point only doing the kitchen. People will say: “Oh yes, a new kitchen but I’m going to rip it out because I’m doing the whole house anyway.” It’ll also show up just how much the other rooms need work. It’s about balance.’Allsopp may be the daughter of a baronet and live in upmarket Notting Hill – with her partner, property developer Ben Anderson and their two boys Bay and Oscar, aged ten and eight – but she is passionate about the struggle moving home can be, having spent more than two decades speaking to families across Britain, rich and poor, about their own difficulties in doing so. So what else will ensure your home sells – especially as the market slows?First impressions count, says Kirstie: ‘Sometimes it’s difficult to see what needs doing when you live in a place, so ask a friend. Your agent won’t tell you, because they’re afraid they’ll offend you and you’ll fire them. Chipped tiles, scruffy unfinished DIY jobs, damp and mould. It’s not always necessary to get someone in – there is a lot you can do yourself.‘But be practical – big jobs, such as rewiring the house, will also mean you need to re-plaster and repaint. You may well not need to get into that.’    Spread the word: A quality extension can add 11 per cent to the value of a home4 INVEST IN BATHTIMEReplacing a bathroom is a job most people don’t want to do themselves. While cost can range from £2,000 to £20,000, at the top end of that scale, a smart new bathroom could add as much as £25,000 or more to the value of your home. Even spending a small amount on an update – from £500 upwards – can add at least three per cent to the potential selling price of your home, according to GE Money. To the average UK homeowner, that’s £6,800.5 DIG DEEPDigging out a new basement to create a whole extra floor is generally deemed to be a good idea, although there is some debate whether it adds to a property’s value. I think it can, but it depends on where you live and how much the work costs. Expect to pay on average from £200 a square foot to convert something already there and from £250 to £300 a square foot if starting from scratch. Not every house suits a subterranean extension, but an estate agent will tell you the local value of property per square foot. That will help you work out whether the cost justifies the expense.6 SPLASH OUT ON WARMTHCentral heating almost always more than pays for itself. The cost to install central heating ranges from £1,000 to £3,000 depending on the system you choose, but value added can be as much as £5,000. Double-glazing likewise doesn’t cost a great deal – anything from a few hundred pounds to a few thousand, depending on the size of the task – and it can add £10,000 or more in value.7 BANK ON GARDENINGEstate agents reckon a garden is one of the best value-adders, swelling value by 20 per cent or more. In cities and large towns, a simple balcony, terrace or patio can augment a home’s value. In the country, buyers tend to expect a property to come with a garden. As with interiors, spend money on the structure of the garden if you can. Buying lots of expensive plants might add less value than working out where a good big feature tree can go, along with a patio and pathways. Installing decking or a patio can add two per cent (£4,538 on the average house price) to a house’s value, says GE Money.9 GO GREENInstalling sensible green devices such as solar panels or wood turbines could certainly add value to your home. Research by the Energy Saving Trust shows that a third of those polled said they would be willing to pay more for a home that uses energy from renewable resources, such as wind, solar or hydropower.10 STAGE A TAKEOVERIf there is a patch of land nearby – big or small – it is always worth doing your research to find out who owns it and see whether you can rent or buy it. There are so many options for how you might use it – including a kitchen garden, an office, a pool, tennis court or a children’s play area – and it will certainly return your investment. 8 STORE THAT BIKEWith more people cycling to stations, work or school these days, secure, waterproof bicycle storage is becoming as important to buyers as parking space or good public transport. A ready-made bike shed costs about £400, and a simple bike rack less than £100.SPREAD THE WORD: A quality extension can add 11 per cent to the value of a home                                                                Your perfect place - at the right priceNo one has exactly the same idea of a dream home – with period, location and space varying according to who is doing the dreaming. Which makes sense, considering the huge variety of housing that we live in.Some might love the community feeling and historic details found in the terraces that so many of us have as our homes or were brought up in. Others might like the quieter life offered by more suburban houses some might crave the wide-open spaces of the countryside, while others might prefer more modern houses with eco features.So, here, Life’s property experts have handpicked a selection of five homes from across the country, all on the market, to give a flavour of the range of housing on offer in Britain. And we have let Kirstie Allsopp loose on them to tell us what she really thinks, and where they each have potential. Because, whether dating back to the 1400s or having been built in the past few years – and whether costing less than £400,000 or £2 million – they all have room for improvement.Kirstie says: ‘One of these could be your dream home but, as I always say, only if it’s in the right location. If the area you live is where you feel happy, then almost any property there will be the right one. I think what happens is that, sometimes, we look for a home that we feel projects our aspirations. But really, you should just think, “Where do I want to live?” And then go for it…’          SUFFOLK - £775,000 Bedrooms: 5-6Unique features: Grade II listed, timber-beamed property called the Flying Chariot in the town of Hadleigh four reception rooms separate contemporary studio covered parking area parts date back to 1400 murals and gargoyles contained within the building.KIRSTIE SAYS: People are nervous of listed properties because they come with so many regulations, but this is an enchanting house.

The three double bedrooms all have small balconies, and there are two bathrooms.The villas are part of a complex with three outdoor swimming pools, some with water slides, as well as basketball, volleyball and tennis courts, plus 24-hour site security.Julian Walker, of Spot Blue, says that Turkey is proving particularly good value for British holidaymakers because of the favourable currency rate between the pound and Turkish lira. He also points to the area around Bodrum becoming more accessible as Turkish Airlines has launched a new summer Gatwick to Bodrum route, running every Wednesday and Saturday until September 8.Across the Mediterranean, the property market in Ibiza is booming. Entry prices for villas, fincas and apartments in some of the most desirable locations increased once again in 2017.There have been increases of up to 17 per cent for fincas in the north of the island and 11 per cent for villas in the west. Florian Fischer, managing partner of Engel \u0026amp Völkers estate agents, which has two outlets on Ibiza, says the luxury end of the market is strong: ‘The number of properties coming on to the market is growing in the luxury segment,’ he says.Engel \u0026amp Völkers cited the sustained growth of private air traffic to Ibiza – it rose by 8.5 per cent in 2017 – and an increase in the number of wealthy visitors drawn to the island’s marinas as indicators that the rich are favouring the island more and more.The company anticipates that residential properties on Ibiza will continue to have a high level of interest, particularly among international buyers and clients from the Spanish mainland, with the current new construction activity resulting in a higher availability of quality properties on the market.However, it feels strict building regulations will mean that a scarcity in supply can be expected in the long term.          A three-bedroom apartment in this block in Ibiza is selling for £481,000For €550,000 (£481,000), Engel \u0026amp Völkers are selling a three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment on the second floor of the building Nueva Ibiza, in Ibiza town. There is air conditioning and the block has a lift. There is also a 24-hour security service, gardens and a communal pool.If having a return on your investment is what you’re after, you may feel more comfortable investing in property in Britain. In which case you could enter the buy-to-let market. One way to do this with the confidence of knowing that you will have a guaranteed income is to buy in a development that promises a certain yield.Developer Crest Nicholson say that investors will receive a return of six per cent for two years if they buy an apartment in Bath Riverside, a collection of flats and penthouse apartments a short walk from the city centre. The variety of accommodation – set on the banks of the River Avon – stretches from studios to four-bedroom homes.Just across the river is the Royal Victoria Park, a substantial green area that includes botanical gardens, children’s play area, tennis courts and Victorian landscaping.However, it is northern England that is regularly top when it comes to percentage profit from buy- to-lets. The cities of Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds have properties that can command yields of eight per cent.It’s surely no coincidence that these cities also have high student populations, and in recent years landlords have profited from the need for housing for the increasing numbers of students in the areas.But if there is someone in your family moving to another part of the country for further education, why not buy a property for him or her so you know they have somewhere decent to live when they are there? And after they have left it could be let to other students.On pages two and three of this supplement we have already dealt with the benefits of new-builds, particularly for first-time buyers.Many of those incentives are transferrable for the buy-to- let market.While you won’t be able to take advantage of Help to Buy, there are other measures that developers offer that might bring down the cost of your investment.Companies such as Galliard Homes have a number of incentives, such as properties coming fully furnished – as many of their new-builds do, including Harbour Central in London’s Docklands.There, Galliard provide Smeg integrated kitchen appliances and free furniture packages that include 40-50in LED TVs, Sonos playbars and mood-lighting.Across the Thames at Surrey Quays, Galliard are specifically targeting investors with their offers at the Marine Wharf East development.Galliard are offering a three per cent discount, a service charge allowance plus a free parking space with three-bedroom apartments there.And in Shoreditch, at their Stage development, Galliard are offsetting the extra three per cent Stamp Duty surcharge that investors pay if buying additional residential properties within England, Wales and Northern Ireland.The Stage also has a unique history to it – the 37-storey tower will include 412 apartments designed around the remains of Shakespeare’s original Curtain Theatre.  Discover the joys of lodge life When it comes to holiday homes in Britain, park homes can work out very cost effective. Because of how they are constructed, they are often a lot cheaper than traditional bricks and mortar houses. And some are located in the most spectacular settings.One example is Palstone Lodges, in the pretty village of South Brent in Devon’s beautiful South Hams. The site includes a collection of contemporary cedar lodges set among landscaped grounds which boast more than 1,000 species of rare and exotic plants, trees and shrubs from around the world.          One example is Palstone Lodges, in the pretty village of South Brent in Devon’s beautiful South Hams (pictured) It extends to five and half acres on the edge of Dartmoor and, as the grounds were established more than 25 years ago, the plots have the privacy that a mature woodland setting can afford.Co-owner Matt Morgan grew up on the farm where the lodges now sit and has been planning the site for more than 30 years.Six lodges are currently available to buy, starting from £175,000 for a two-bedroom and rising to £255,000 for a three-bedroom lodge.Peter and Yvette Cheeseman, both retirees from Dorset, say they made a lifestyle investment when they purchased their Palstone lodge and claim their family now saves £10,000 a year on holidays.‘We had money available from our pension and we were trying to think about what we might be able to buy,’ says Peter.‘We liked the idea of escaping to Devon to get away from our busy lives in Dorset where I still have business interests and Yvette competes with her horses.’          Devon delight: One of the Palstone lodgesWhat really stood out for Peter and Yvette were the secluded plots the lodges were sat on and how they are exclusively for the use of owners, their friends and family only.‘That gave us the added confidence that we were making the right decision,’ says Peter. ‘It meant that we could have certainty and peace of mind that people buying at Palstone Lodges genuinely cared about their property and who stays there.’Peter and Yvette’s four children also enjoy their Devon bolt-hole. ‘For them, it’s a free holiday,’ says Peter. ‘We take pleasure in the fact that we’re giving them something special as part of our family unit.’Each plot has a 125-year licence and annual service charges of £2,750, plus VAT, which covers garden and grounds maintenance and general insurance. Each property is free from Stamp Duty and Council Tax.The lodges are designed as holiday homes and not places of permanent residence.          Regulars: Phil and Rebecca Grant with their children Rory and OscarRebecca and Phil Grant, from Harpenden in Hertfordshire, often come to their Palstone lodge with their children Rory and Oscar.‘For me, working in horticulture, the attraction came from the setting, with established planting and carefully curated landscaping,’ says Rebecca. ‘It seemed to suit us perfectly. We wanted a gentle, soft green space.’Since buying more than ten years ago, they have visited the lodge most months, taking extra time there in the summers.Rebecca and Phil have made good friends with the neighbours and even socialise with them away from Palstone Lodges. Rebecca feels this has been of vital importance to them, and even more so now they have a young family.‘When we visit now we know people are there, some of whom have become great friends, but we can’t hear or see them from our lodge,’ says Rebecca.‘It’s really nice to have a sense that everyone who has a home there wants a similar way of life.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/19/4D62E26B00000578-5878117-image-a-5_1529780104780.jpg","title":"Boom Boom Boris blasts Becker insists hes not broke","story":"    Boris Becker has been declared bankrupt and forced to sell his precious trophies to begin paying off a rumoured £54 million debt, while his nine-year marriage to Lilly, the mother of his eight-year-old son, has collapsedIt has been a tumultuous year, to say the least, for Boris Becker.The former Wimbledon champion has been declared bankrupt and forced to sell his precious trophies to begin paying off a rumoured £54 million debt, while his nine-year marriage to Lilly, the mother of his eight-year-old son, has collapsed.Then, in a farcical twist to an already bizarre story, he was accused of falsely claiming to be a diplomat for the Central African Republic in a bid to wriggle out of paying his debts. On Friday, even the country’s foreign minister, Charles Armel Doubane, called Becker’s diplomatic passport a fake.So it’s a surprise to see the tennis legend so ebullient. He’s frustrated, yes, but still instantly recognisable as the irrepressible, confidently –and often bluntly – outspoken Boris whose BBC commentary will again entertain and inform Wimbledon fans when the tournament starts next week.And in a series of volleys of the same ferocity that earned him the nickname Boom Boom Becker during his stellar tennis career, he hits back, saying:He’s not bankrupt – in fact he makes ‘more money than 99 per cent of the world’ and has paid the money he owesHe is a genuine diplomat with the passport to prove it, and he took the role purely because of his ‘passion for humanitarian affairs’Divorcing his second wife at the age of 50 makes him ‘conservative’ compared to other celebrities.          In a series of volleys of the same ferocity that earned him the nickname Boom Boom Becker during his stellar tennis career, he insists that he is not bankruptBoris admits that since the High Court declared him insolvent on June 21, 2017, ‘it’s probably been the most difficult year of my life. \u0027The case has put a lot of pressure on me. \u0027I know how it looks from the outside. Whatever I owe, the price I’m paying is much higher.’But after reading the torrent of stories about himself – in which he claims ‘the only thing they did write correctly was my name’ – he’s here to set the record straight. And, he says, the true picture is very different from what’s been reported.                            This has been the most difficult year of my life                         First and foremost, he says: ‘I’m not broke’ – emphasising he’s been made personally bankrupt, not professionally bankrupt.‘Boris Becker plc is doing very well. We are still making more money than 99 per cent of the world, let’s be realistic. \u0027I have plenty of money in my account, my credit card works and everything’s normal.‘Yet the whole world is asking, “But how can you pay for dinner? How can you pay for your flat? We thought you were bankrupt.” \u0027But as far as I’m concerned, I’ve paid all I owe. I’m not running from my responsibilities. \u0027On the contrary, I would like to close the insolvency book as quickly as possible.’          Boris denies that his split from Lilly, with whom he has a son, Amadeus, has anything to do with his financial woesMost of what’s happened is, he insists, a big misunderstanding, which he describes in detail during our meeting at his agent’s office. His blue eyes fix me with an intense gaze throughout the conversation, but when he smiles, his face transforms back into that of the good-natured boy from Germany who won Wimbledon aged just 17 in 1985. Wearing an expensive suit paired with red Puma trainers, his hair slicked back and a smattering of sunburn, he looks relaxed, but says he is ready to do battle.‘I’ve never been afraid of a fight,’ he says, with a flash of the grit that won him six major singles titles.He triggered a collective raising of eyebrows earlier this month when it was reported that he had become a diplomat for the Central African Republic. As his lawyers pointed out to the High Court, this would make him immune from bankruptcy proceedings under the 1961 Vienna Convention. To critics, the timing of his appointment as sports ambassador to a tiny nation seemed a little too convenient.Cherubin Moroubama, chief of staff for the nation’s foreign ministry, said: ‘The diplomatic passport that he has is a fake’, adding that its serial number corresponded to a batch stolen in 2014. The country’s prosecutor is now investigating.But according to Boris, his appointment is real and he has the paperwork to prove it.‘I was approached by the ambassador of the CAR in March and consequently met the President who asked if I’d be interested in representing the country internationally, and I was very honoured,’ he says. ‘I was inaugurated by the president in April in Brussels, witnessed by dignitaries from the CAR and my own legal advisers as well as the ambassador who gave me the diplomatic documents and a passport which is currently at the US embassy in Brussels for visa applications, so I don’t have it with me.‘I agree that the comments from the foreign minister and his office are confusing and perplexing. I’m very keen this should be resolved.’And he insists: ‘My appointment has nothing to do with my insolvency case. Humanitarian affairs are something I care deeply about.’          He’s aware some people assume a major reason for his money troubles are the payouts he’s made to women, first to Barbara (pictured), mother of his two eldest sons, in 2000, then to Russian model Angela Ermakova, with whom he fathered a daughter, Anna, after a tryst in a London restaurantBut Boris, I ask, have you ever been to the Central African Republic? ‘No, not yet, I was only recently appointed,’ he says, adding quickly: ‘We’ve been looking at dates, but the President is a busy man.’He says the reason the High Court was told of his new diplomatic status was purely because he was bound to disclose his new, official address in Brussels. Can he see, though, how it could be viewed as a scheme cooked up to help him out of his predicament?‘I can see why it could look like that,’ he concedes. ‘But that’s why I’m talking to The Mail on Sunday now, to put the record straight.’Boris denies that his split from Lilly, with whom he has a son, Amadeus, has anything to do with his financial woes. ‘A marriage break-up doesn’t happen overnight – it’s a long process,’ he says.Love split Lilly turns her back on Boris Becker after nine...Share this article‘We are moving on and ultimately, there will be a orce. It’s being done as amicably as possible and our main concern is Amadeus. Lilly’s a wonderful woman and a great mother, but people unfortunately break up.’The continuing interest in his private life frustrates him. ‘When I look at how many celebrities have been married and orced since I split up with my first wife, Barbara 19 years ago, I’m very conservative. \u0027My second orce and I’m 50 – could be worse!’ He’s aware some people assume a major reason for his money troubles are the payouts he’s made to women, first to Barbara, mother of his two eldest sons, in 2000, then to Russian model Angela Ermakova, with whom he fathered a daughter, Anna, after a tryst in a London restaurant.  In a farcical twist to an already bizarre story, he was accused of falsely claiming to be a diplomat for the Central African Republic in a bid to wriggle out of paying his debts. He is pictured left with President Faustin Archange Touadera‘That’s absolutely not accurate,’ he says. ‘I had a pre-nup with my first wife and a orce in Germany so whatever people fantasised about a double-digit million number, not true. \u0027But more importantly, we’re on great terms. And Anna is on great form and my relationship with her mother is intact.’He’s found recent reports about his mansion in Majorca being taken over by squatters perplexing ‘because I sold it two years ago. \u0027It’s terrible that squatters are there, but it’s not mine’.Becker’s problems stem from a loan taken out with private bank Arbuthnot Latham, who launched the insolvency case over a reported £9 million he owes them.          Becker’s problems stem from a loan taken out with private bank Arbuthnot Latham, who launched the insolvency case over a reported £9 million he owes themBecker puts the figure at £3.4 million and claims that the bank charged him 25 per cent interest – claims the bank deny.He also claims the bank has used his celebrity status to demand more, and says he tried to find a solution before the bankruptcy judgment last June, such as moving the loan to another bank. ‘But there was no chance for me to negotiate a settlement. They refused to meet me and my advisers and they kept moving me into insolvency.’But the bank say: ‘Mr Becker’s colourful version of events simply does not tally with the facts and has already been dismissed by a judge. Arbuthnot Latham has at all times dealt with Mr Becker in good faith.’The £54 million figure bandied about for Boris’s total debts – including a claim for £34 million from a Swiss businessman – is absurd, he says. ‘How can you spend that much? Do you see any yachts?’But he says. ‘I have a good income and can spend whatever I want.’He can’t deny he’s made some poor business decisions over the years. In 2002, he received a two-year suspended sentence in Germany for tax evasion. Some of his businesses, including the website Sportgate, have failed. ‘Mistakes have been made, but Sportgate was almost 20 years ago. That’s business.’He adds: ‘I’ve never been driven by money. I won my first Wimbledon and forgot to take the pay check because it wasn’t important to me. I just wanted to win.’ Still, he was ‘completely taken aback’ by the High Court judgment, which he says, in typical Boris-speak, ‘happened to me like a baby to a virgin’.He believes the assets which have been collected from him in the past year by the court-appointed trustees from law firm Smith \u0026amp Williamson, which total £4.4 million, more than cover the debt. ‘I’m happy to pay back what I owe,’ he says.Theoretically, he should have been discharged from bankruptcy last week, a year after the ruling. However, the situation is rumbling on. ‘The trustee wants to prolong the insolvency for at least another six months because he doesn’t believe I’m co-operative,’ he says.    Speaking of his orce from Lilly, Boris said: ‘A marriage break-up doesn’t happen overnight – it’s a long process\u0027Boris does not believe the trustee is as neutral as he should be. ‘For some reason, they were fascinated with selling all my trophies, although I explained to them that they have strong emotional value but very little financial value. \u0027There was no need to do it, but that’s just taking the knife and digging it into my heart and saying, “We have you and we can do what we want.” ’The trustees, however, say their job is to act in the best interests of Boris’s creditors and say the sale of his trophies and memorabilia should raise more than £200,000, ‘not a sum we consider immaterial’.Becker says he is preparing a counter-suit against the bank for malpractice and gross negligence. ‘The fact is we’re going back to court soon to fight this and expect to win. I strongly feel that they were taking advantage of my fame and they thought I couldn’t afford to go to court so I would probably agree to pay a much higher sum.  Becker says he is preparing a counter-suit against the bank for malpractice and gross negligence. Becker says he is preparing a counter-suit against the bank for malpractice and gross negligence and right victorious‘If you want to blackmail me, you’ve picked the wrong guy because I’m happy to fight.‘What they are doing isn’t right. It’s probably the toughest match of my life, but I’m not afraid. Let’s play. I’ve never been known as someone to run away.’He now has until July 30 to present evidence that he has paid what he owes and he hopes his insolvency will be over in October. ‘I’m looking forward to having this difficult year out of the way,’ he says.He’s also excited about Wimbledon, which begins on July 2. ‘It’s the best part of the year for me, working for the BBC and talking about tennis. This country has adopted me, it’s my home and I love it.‘I’ve had to concentrate at times on keeping my spirits and sense of humour up by remembering what my passion is.’He says his ordeal has made him more reflective. ‘Some of what has happened I think is because I’m Boris Becker, a celebrity. But that’s the price to pay for all the opportunities I’ve had.‘I have a chance now to wipe the slate clean, to learn from my mistakes, to associate myself with better people perhaps. I’m not bitter. I’m healthy, I have a job I love and a wonderful family. I have a lot going for me.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/20/4D8F5E1300000578-5878161-image-a-39_1529781037200.jpg","title":"The downsizing lowdown make moving smaller home","story":"    Home comforts: The Greenhouse and Pavillion at Wadswick Green in WiltshireCraig Gibson, a partner at WDM Chartered Accountants, says: ‘Homes are a massive asset for people who have been committed to them for decades, so understanding your options is essential, especially when you’re selling.’And if you’re tempted to hand over your house or large chunks of money to your children, he says, ‘there are some ways to give your children cash or your home, but it’s very important to get good independent financial advice’. For instance, the annual allowance for tax-free gifts to children (or anyone else) is £3,000 per person. But parents can give up to £5,000 to children as wedding or civil-partnership gifts tax-free. Regular payments are exempt from inheritance tax, as long as they come from your income and not your savings and don’t significantly affect your lifestyle.When downsizing, it is important to consider what would be left to your children when you die.The inheritance-tax threshold currently stands at £325,000, and the rate payable on estates of more than that is 40 per cent of the amount above £325,000. The exception is if you are married, as you can pass your full estate to your spouse in the event of your death without paying inheritance tax. By doing this you also pass on your £325,000 inheritance-tax exemption, so £650,000 of your combined estate would then be free from inheritance tax.          Luxury living: One of Birchgrove\u0027s apartments in SidcupIf you go into residential care, you may have to sell your home to pay for it. One way to hold on to your home so you can pass the proceeds on to your children is to buy in a retirement development, like Wadswick Green in Wiltshire, where help is on hand for that care. However, exit fees that the development takes when you die will deplete any money you can pass on – as will service charges.Another option to free up money from your home is equity release. You have to be over 55 to go down this path, but it allows you to release money as a lump sum, or in several smaller amounts, or as a combination of both. And while equity-release products give you access to the cash in your home, they tend to be more expensive than regular mortgages and have associated fees. Triggering equity release may also affect your ability to claim state benefits.With so many people’s money in bricks and mortar – and with, these days, so many options available to those reaching retirement age – it’s no wonder that experts say it’s more important than ever before to look at ‘succession planning’.  Rent your way to riches In America, Australia and on the Continent, renting in retirement is much more popular than here. The British obsession with home ownership means we are keener than those in other countries to tie up our money in property.But there was 13 per cent increase in retired renters here between 2012 to 2016, according to the National Landlords Association, and Scottish Widows recently predicted figures will double to nine million by 2022.

Perched on top of the dome was a statue of Neptune, which protruded from the lake’s surface and was the only part of the structure visible from land.An air vent emerged through Neptune’s mouth and wisps of smoke were sometimes seen drifting out of it when Wright and his friends were enjoying cigars.To ensure clear views, Wright hired ers to keep the dome free from algae. Spellbound guests were able to watch fish and sometimes swimmers overhead. On summer nights, he switched off the lights so his friends could watch firework displays or gaze at the stars magnified by curved glass and water.A short flight of steps led to another underwater room with concrete walls and a curved ceiling supported on cast-iron columns. Lit by porthole-shaped skylights and equipped with a billiards table and card tables, this was the Lord of the Manor’s secret gaming room, where the men could head off for post-prandial fun.Run-down farmhouse which was bought for £300,000 then...There’s not much SPACE! Boatbuilder creates tiny...Share this articleThe ladies were catered for, too. From the gaming room, another staircase led to a stone viewing platform on the surface of the lake, where on summer afternoons his wife Anna and her friends could take tea.Wright’s tale has fascinated me ever since I first encountered this underwater hideaway while researching architectural follies. I wondered what sort of person could have built such a place. And the answer, I found, was a man the Victorians called the Napoleon of Finance, whose epic story – the subject of my new biography – was in many ways a forerunner of more modern financial disasters.Corpulent, grandiose and bull-necked, James Wright was an unlikely tycoon. Born in 1846, the eldest of five children of a Methodist preacher, he, too, became a minister before setting up a printing business in Halifax with his brother that promptly went bankrupt.The pair narrowly avoided prison, and on their father’s death, both emigrated to Toronto. Wright – by now using his middle name Whitaker – was lured by an oil boom to Philadelphia, where he met and married Anna in 1878. He set up a series of businesses, again sailing perilously close to the wind. In 1877, he and four partners were accused of making false claims in the prospectus of a new company and charged with conspiracy to defraud stockholders. Yet Wright escaped prosecution and, ever the adventurer, decided to became a prospector in America’s Wild West. An outgoing man with a quick wit and a ready charm, he made friends freely in saloons and gambling dens. Indeed, he enjoyed the rough-and-tumble boomtown life and later claimed he had witnessed ‘fierce revolver fights in the dancing halls’.          Deep secret: The underwater dome\u0027s 200 panes of glass were kept clean by a team of ersIt was in Leadville, Colorado, that he made his first fortune, talking up the prospects of a silver mine in 1880 and floating the company for $5 million (about £85 million in today’s money) on the New York stock exchange.By the time the business went bust, Wright had made a fat profit and was long gone. He repeated the trick in Utah, California, Nevada and New Mexico, where he set up a company that initially, at least, rewarded its investors handsomely.For the first five months it paid out $100,000 a month in idends as more than $1 million in silver was brought to the surface. The company’s share price soared, but again the bonanza did not last. In 1889, with his reputation tarnished and creditors breathing down his neck, he decided to reinvent himself in the land of his birth. Wright began promoting West Australian gold mines on the London stock exchange and, as the money rolled in like never before, he looked for a country property befitting of his enormous wealth, in part to prove to himself and his family that he had left that early disgrace in Halifax far behind.With money no object, he bought two tracts of land at Witley, near Godalming, paying £150,000 for the Lea Park estate, which included a 19th Century manor house, and £100,000 for the adjacent South Park Farm estate.Striding through his 9,000 acres, which contained 90 miles of roads and lanes, five lodges and ten farms, he set his swirling imagination to work. A small tributary of the River Wey meandered through the grounds, but Wright envisaged a series of great lakes, complete with islands. Most of the exotic ideas were his own. Under the direction of London architect Paxton Hood Watson, two wings were added to the existing manor house at the stupendous cost of £400,000.          Whitaker Wright was convicted of fraud in 2004The new west wing was adorned with a vast conservatory, which alone cost £10,000 (about £1 million today) and a large central glass dome filled with trees and exotic plants from across the world – a rival to Kew Gardens. The east wing, meanwhile, accommodated a domed observatory with a revolving copper roof.Between these two great embellishments were 32 bedrooms, 11 bathrooms and seven reception rooms, the largest of which, at more than 2,600 square feet, was the cedar-panelled ballroom, with a dancefloor capable of accommodating hundreds. Wright even found room for a small private hospital and, oddly, one of Britain’s first private velodromes.The stable block, capable of holding 50 horses, was a centrally heated equine palace with a viewing space from which visitors could admire their mounts from the comfort of leather-upholstered settees shaded by palms. Months of work resulted in the creation of the square lake, the bathing lake and the big lake. A boathouse was home to a flotilla of electric launches, sailing craft and rowing boats.It all came at quite a cost. Over the years his improvements to the estate cost an estimated £1,115,000 – then an extraordinary amount of money. But the overblown and impossibly extravagant house – he had a staff of 77 – was a perfect expression of his creator.In Queen Victoria’s diamond jubilee year of 1897, government Ministers and peers were among those who rushed to buy shares in his booming London and Globe Company and other mining-related companies.To impress investors, Wright made a point of appointing Establishment figures as directors. Future prime minister Arthur Balfour and members of the Spencer-Churchill family all invested. Even the Royal Family was said to have benefited.Whether or not these rumours were true, they were widely believed and Wright did nothing to dispel them. He established another Royal connection when he struck up a friendship with the spendthrift Sir James Reid, personal physician to Queen Victoria – in 1896 he sought Wright’s advice on how to make a killing on the stock market.To the world at large, it seemed he could do no wrong.But like the latter-day conman Charles Ponzi, inventor of the fraud scheme that bears his name, Wright’s business acumen was not as it seemed.          A dolphin\u0027s head water feature in the grounds of the estate which included lakes and islandsJust as in America, many of his much-vaunted mining prospects turned out to be duds and he used accounting tricks to make them appear solvent in annual accounts All such frauds must, eventually, come crashing down.And in a true fin de siècle moment, his house of cards collapsed on the last day of trading of the 19th Century.Panic spread in the stock market. Shares in Wright’s companies halved and 20 firms of stockbrokers were ruined.Wright fled to France and boarded a liner to New York, only to be arrested on arrival thanks to a transatlantic cable from Scotland Yard. He was brought back to London to stand trial.On January 26, 1904, he was convicted of fraud at the Royal Courts of Justice and given a seven-year prison sentence, but he evaded justice by swallowing cyanide in a court anteroom almost immediately afterwards.Magnificent as it was, Wright’s great project at Lea Park was never completed. After passing through a variety of owners, the big house burned down in 1952 and the buildings were demolished.The underwater dome, still watertight after 120 years, is now a Grade II-listed building – a monument not merely to folly, but to a life of extraordinary excess.lUltimate Folly: The Rises And Falls Of Whitaker Wright, by Henry Macrory, is published by Biteback at £20.

Ms Ardern is set to make history as the first New Zealand Prime Minister to give birth while in the top seat          Following the birth, the government will be led by Winston Peters, 73, for six weeks.

Erdogan has filed close to 2,000 lawsuits against people, including school children, for insulting him. Turks went to the polls this morning in presidential and parliamentary elections that pose the biggest ballot box challenge to  Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted AK Party since they swept to power over 15 years ago.The elections will also usher in a powerful new executive presidency long sought by Erdogan and backed by a small majority of Turks in a 2017 referendum.      More than 56 million people were registered to vote at 180,000 ballot boxes across the country          A ballot station official shows a Turkish voter a ballot paper with images of presidential candidates at a polling station at a primary school in Ankara, Turkey          Pictured: President Erdogan is seeking a fourth term as Turkey\u0027s president, but has so far avoided taking part in any TV debates           Cars drive past posters for presidential candidates Turkey\u0027s President and ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, left, and Meral Aksener, the presidential candidate of nationalist opposition Iyi (Good) Party in Ankara          A man waits to cast his ballot at a polling station during the presidential and parliamentary elections in the Kurdish-dominated city of Diyarbakir          Turkish people cast their vote for the Turkish presidential and parliamentary elections in Ankara.

Fear will continue to reign ... If Ince wins, the courts will be independent,\u0027 he said, adding he would lift Turkey\u0027s state of emergency within 48 hours of being elected. Turkey has been under emergency rule - which restricts some personal freedoms and allows the government to bypass parliament with emergency decrees - for nearly two years following an abortive military coup in July 2016.Erdogan blamed the coup on his former ally, US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, and has waged a sweeping crackdown on the preacher\u0027s followers in Turkey. The United Nations say some 160,000 people have been detained and nearly as many more, including teachers, judges and soldiers, sacked.Erdogan vows to become Turkey\u0027s \u0027grandmaster\u0027: President...Erdogan bans Uber: Turkish president bows to pressure from...Revealed: UK holidaymakers travelling to Europe after Brexit...Brussels plots to make Britons buy £50 visas to visit Europe...Share this articleThe president\u0027s critics, including the European Union which Turkey still nominally aspires to join, say Erdogan has used the crackdown to stifle dissent. Few newspapers or other media openly criticise the government and he has received far more election coverage than other presidential candidates.\u0027This is no longer a Turkey we want. Rights are violated, democracy is in terrible shape,\u0027 said health sector worker Sema, 50, after voting in Istanbul.She and others in the city said they voted for the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u0027 Democratic Party (HDP) so that it exceeds the 10 percent threshold of votes needed to enter parliament. If it does so, it will be harder for the AKP to get a majority.          Erdogan at a rally of his own supporters this week in the city of Kahramanmaras on Thursday. He has so far refused to take part in television debates during the election Erdogan, who defends his tough measures as essential for national security, told his supporters at rallies on Saturday that if re-elected he would press ahead with more of the big infrastructure projects that have helped turn Turkey into one of the world\u0027s fastest-growing economies during his time in office.Polls show Erdogan falling short of a first-round victory in the presidential race but he would be expected to win a run-off on July 8, while his AK Party could lose its parliamentary majority, possibly heralding increased tensions between president and parliament.Other presidential candidates include Selahattin Demirtas, HDP leader, who is now in jail on terrorism-related charges that he denies.In a final appeal for votes in a video clip from his high security prison, Demirtas said: \u0027If the HDP fails to get into parliament, all Turkey will lose. Backing the HDP means supporting democracy.\u0027    On Friday, a rally held by Ince was blacked out by state broadcasters after he dared Erdogan to \u0027confront him\u0027 in a TV debate. At a mass rally in the city of Ankara on Friday, Ince, said: \u0027Tomorrow is the last evening. If you have the courage, confront me,\u0027 he said. But as he began his speech at another event in Istanbul, he was handed a note saying the broadcast of the rally was \u0027down\u0027 on a state TV channel, which he quickly branded \u0027sabotage\u0027 on Edrogan\u0027s part.          Supporters of Ince wave flags during the election rally in Izmir on June 21. The opposition is seeking to prevent Erdogan winning a fourth term as the country\u0027s leader Ince has held three rallies in three days in the cities of Ankara and Izmir.   Throwing down the gauntlet to the president, Ince said: \u0027Look, that\u0027s my last proposal to you. If you want, I can even cancel my Istanbul rally for you. Come, confront me, let\u0027s debate on TV.\u0027The event was the second giant rally the opposition leader addressed within the space of two days.Erdogan, a favourite to win the presidential polls, has in the past rejected the opposition candidate\u0027s proposal for a television debate, saying that \u0027I don\u0027t want anyone to get points through me\u0027.Ince has injected a breath of fresh air into the presidential campaign with his dynamism and oratorical skills comparable to those of Erdogan. In Ankara, Ince accused the state-run Anadolu news agency and TRT television of committing a \u0027constitutional crime\u0027 for failing to be even-handed.\u0027TRT aired Erdogan for 181 hours, Muharrem Ince for 15 hours,\u0027 he said."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/21/4D5DAB7B00000578-0-image-m-58_1529786970174.jpg","title":"Top private schools including Eton shun new GCSEs favour easier tests","story":"Give me £20billion or I\u0027ll bring you down: Defence...Share this articleParent Shazia Aktar, whose 15-year old daughter is doing her GCSEs, branded the pressure students are put under as \u0027disgusting\u0027.She told MailOnline: \u0027I have a 15 year old daughter who cried when she returned home from school on Thursday after finishing her history paper.\u0027She was so upset she locked herself in her bedroom, she didn’t get to complete her paper.

You got this, but it still was not enough. DAILY BRIEFING: Britain and the EU \u0027must allow contracts to...Bank branch staff help stop £25m worth of fraud thanks to...Dixons Carphone posts profits plunge in wake of major cyber...Share this articleHow to choose the best (and cheapest) DIY investing Isa - and our pick of the platformsPayPal\u0027s next demand was for a \u0027seizure document\u0027 from Trading Standards or the police. This would guarantee a refund, you were promised. You arranged this with your local authority\u0027s Trading Standards Office in Milton Keynes and told PayPal, but the next day you received an email saying this was again not enough. Worse was to come. The left hand at PayPal then started disagreeing with the right hand.  While one person at the company was insisting that you return the fake watch to the seller, another was telling you to keep it as evidence it was counterfeit. As I pointed out to PayPal, if the seller was indeed a crook, he would likely deny ever having received the watch if you returned it. Or, he could claim that the watch you returned was not the same as the watch he supplied. Either way, you would then be without both the watch and the £9,000.A final twist in the tale came when Trading Standards pointed out that as Rolex had confirmed the watch was a fake, if PayPal released your money to the fraudster, this could be regarded as money laundering, which is an offence in itself. I asked officials at PayPal to look into all of this. It told me: \u0027We never ask a buyer to return goods when we have been given proof they were counterfeit.\u0027It said it received that proof from Trading Standards on May 30. Now, I am not sure what proof that was exactly since I have seen a statement sent to PayPal by Trading Standards as long ago as March 26. It confirmed Rolex itself had judged the watch to be a fake. No matter, though. The important thing is that PayPal has now refunded the £9,000 back to the credit card you used. It has also made a goodwill credit of £100 to your PayPal account. Perhaps it might be best to avoid buying expensive second-hand watches.Why have my tax letters been ignored for months?S.T. writes: My tax office asked me to obtain official confirmation from the Department for Work \u0026amp Pensions showing the amount of my state pension for the tax years 2016-17 and 2017-18. I wrote to the department, giving my own calculations, but received no reply. I wrote again a month later and then again a month after that. But I still received no reply. A month later I submitted a written complaint, but I received no reply to this either. I am 83 years old and can do without these problems.Tony Hetherington replies: It really is frustrating to have one Government department asking you to get information from another one, only to find that the second department simply ignores you, even when you complain.You contacted the DWP in Wolverhampton, so I asked officials at its head office in London what had gone wrong. They told me they regret that you were ignored for four months, but failed to explain why. They have assured me you now have a written answer confirming that the pension figures held by your tax office are correct.

I telephoned but was fobbed off by a rude employee who told me it was not possible to contact customer services by phone because, \u0027Who would want to listen to that all day? Anyone can make up a plausible story.\u0027Tony Hetherington replies: Ryanair was concerned at the way you were treated when you called. I have given the airline the contact number you rang so this can be investigated. As for your refund Ryanair agrees you cancelled your flight and requested a refund, but it says you were asked to complete a claim form and failed to do this. You have told me that you submitted the claim form at least three times along with a copy of a doctor\u0027s note about your husband\u0027s illness. After I asked the airline to look into this, it emailed you to say the refund would go ahead. You have now received £233.I never agreed to be guarantor on policyM.H. writes: My son was learning to drive and was insured on a learner policy with Adrian Flux Insurance Services. I was paying monthly for this, and part of the policy was that it would be cancelled once he passed his test. He did pass and the policy was cancelled, but when he took out a new policy he found he could not have a monthly payment plan as he is only 17. Adrian Flux then put me down as guarantor and opened a finance agreement in my name, without my signature or consent. It says they are allowed to do this, but is it legal?Tony Hetherington replies: The answer of course is no. You cannot be held to a finance agreement that you never authorised. But you told me that when you protested to Adrian Flux, you were informed that the Financial Conduct Authority was aware of this practice, and if you cancelled the cover it would cost £486.I do not believe the regulator would ever accept this, but it does not matter now as the insurer has told me there has been \u0027a simple misunderstanding\u0027. It seems that when your son took out his new policy, your details were mistakenly transferred over from the old policy. The company told me that naming you as \u0027guarantor\u0027 was \u0027incorrect and a human error\u0027. The agreement has been scrapped and Adrian Flux has made a goodwill offer which you have accepted. If you believe you are the victim of financial wrongdoing, write to Tony Hetherington at Financial Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TS or email tony.hetherington@mailonsunday.co.uk.

The three double bedrooms all have small balconies, and there are two bathrooms.The villas are part of a complex with three outdoor swimming pools, some with water slides, as well as basketball, volleyball and tennis courts, plus 24-hour site security.Julian Walker, of Spot Blue, says that Turkey is proving particularly good value for British holidaymakers because of the favourable currency rate between the pound and Turkish lira. He also points to the area around Bodrum becoming more accessible as Turkish Airlines has launched a new summer Gatwick to Bodrum route, running every Wednesday and Saturday until September 8.Across the Mediterranean, the property market in Ibiza is booming. Entry prices for villas, fincas and apartments in some of the most desirable locations increased once again in 2017.There have been increases of up to 17 per cent for fincas in the north of the island and 11 per cent for villas in the west. Florian Fischer, managing partner of Engel \u0026amp Völkers estate agents, which has two outlets on Ibiza, says the luxury end of the market is strong: ‘The number of properties coming on to the market is growing in the luxury segment,’ he says.Engel \u0026amp Völkers cited the sustained growth of private air traffic to Ibiza – it rose by 8.5 per cent in 2017 – and an increase in the number of wealthy visitors drawn to the island’s marinas as indicators that the rich are favouring the island more and more.The company anticipates that residential properties on Ibiza will continue to have a high level of interest, particularly among international buyers and clients from the Spanish mainland, with the current new construction activity resulting in a higher availability of quality properties on the market.However, it feels strict building regulations will mean that a scarcity in supply can be expected in the long term.          A three-bedroom apartment in this block in Ibiza is selling for £481,000For €550,000 (£481,000), Engel \u0026amp Völkers are selling a three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment on the second floor of the building Nueva Ibiza, in Ibiza town. There is air conditioning and the block has a lift. There is also a 24-hour security service, gardens and a communal pool.If having a return on your investment is what you’re after, you may feel more comfortable investing in property in Britain. In which case you could enter the buy-to-let market. One way to do this with the confidence of knowing that you will have a guaranteed income is to buy in a development that promises a certain yield.Developer Crest Nicholson say that investors will receive a return of six per cent for two years if they buy an apartment in Bath Riverside, a collection of flats and penthouse apartments a short walk from the city centre. The variety of accommodation – set on the banks of the River Avon – stretches from studios to four-bedroom homes.Just across the river is the Royal Victoria Park, a substantial green area that includes botanical gardens, children’s play area, tennis courts and Victorian landscaping.However, it is northern England that is regularly top when it comes to percentage profit from buy- to-lets. The cities of Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds have properties that can command yields of eight per cent.It’s surely no coincidence that these cities also have high student populations, and in recent years landlords have profited from the need for housing for the increasing numbers of students in the areas.But if there is someone in your family moving to another part of the country for further education, why not buy a property for him or her so you know they have somewhere decent to live when they are there? And after they have left it could be let to other students.On pages two and three of this supplement we have already dealt with the benefits of new-builds, particularly for first-time buyers.Many of those incentives are transferrable for the buy-to- let market.While you won’t be able to take advantage of Help to Buy, there are other measures that developers offer that might bring down the cost of your investment.Companies such as Galliard Homes have a number of incentives, such as properties coming fully furnished – as many of their new-builds do, including Harbour Central in London’s Docklands.There, Galliard provide Smeg integrated kitchen appliances and free furniture packages that include 40-50in LED TVs, Sonos playbars and mood-lighting.Across the Thames at Surrey Quays, Galliard are specifically targeting investors with their offers at the Marine Wharf East development.Galliard are offering a three per cent discount, a service charge allowance plus a free parking space with three-bedroom apartments there.And in Shoreditch, at their Stage development, Galliard are offsetting the extra three per cent Stamp Duty surcharge that investors pay if buying additional residential properties within England, Wales and Northern Ireland.The Stage also has a unique history to it – the 37-storey tower will include 412 apartments designed around the remains of Shakespeare’s original Curtain Theatre.  Discover the joys of lodge life When it comes to holiday homes in Britain, park homes can work out very cost effective. Because of how they are constructed, they are often a lot cheaper than traditional bricks and mortar houses. And some are located in the most spectacular settings.One example is Palstone Lodges, in the pretty village of South Brent in Devon’s beautiful South Hams. The site includes a collection of contemporary cedar lodges set among landscaped grounds which boast more than 1,000 species of rare and exotic plants, trees and shrubs from around the world.          One example is Palstone Lodges, in the pretty village of South Brent in Devon’s beautiful South Hams (pictured) It extends to five and half acres on the edge of Dartmoor and, as the grounds were established more than 25 years ago, the plots have the privacy that a mature woodland setting can afford.Co-owner Matt Morgan grew up on the farm where the lodges now sit and has been planning the site for more than 30 years.Six lodges are currently available to buy, starting from £175,000 for a two-bedroom and rising to £255,000 for a three-bedroom lodge.Peter and Yvette Cheeseman, both retirees from Dorset, say they made a lifestyle investment when they purchased their Palstone lodge and claim their family now saves £10,000 a year on holidays.‘We had money available from our pension and we were trying to think about what we might be able to buy,’ says Peter.‘We liked the idea of escaping to Devon to get away from our busy lives in Dorset where I still have business interests and Yvette competes with her horses.’          Devon delight: One of the Palstone lodgesWhat really stood out for Peter and Yvette were the secluded plots the lodges were sat on and how they are exclusively for the use of owners, their friends and family only.‘That gave us the added confidence that we were making the right decision,’ says Peter. ‘It meant that we could have certainty and peace of mind that people buying at Palstone Lodges genuinely cared about their property and who stays there.’Peter and Yvette’s four children also enjoy their Devon bolt-hole. ‘For them, it’s a free holiday,’ says Peter. ‘We take pleasure in the fact that we’re giving them something special as part of our family unit.’Each plot has a 125-year licence and annual service charges of £2,750, plus VAT, which covers garden and grounds maintenance and general insurance. Each property is free from Stamp Duty and Council Tax.The lodges are designed as holiday homes and not places of permanent residence.          Regulars: Phil and Rebecca Grant with their children Rory and OscarRebecca and Phil Grant, from Harpenden in Hertfordshire, often come to their Palstone lodge with their children Rory and Oscar.‘For me, working in horticulture, the attraction came from the setting, with established planting and carefully curated landscaping,’ says Rebecca. ‘It seemed to suit us perfectly. We wanted a gentle, soft green space.’Since buying more than ten years ago, they have visited the lodge most months, taking extra time there in the summers.Rebecca and Phil have made good friends with the neighbours and even socialise with them away from Palstone Lodges. Rebecca feels this has been of vital importance to them, and even more so now they have a young family.‘When we visit now we know people are there, some of whom have become great friends, but we can’t hear or see them from our lodge,’ says Rebecca.‘It’s really nice to have a sense that everyone who has a home there wants a similar way of life.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/23/20/4D8F5E1300000578-5878161-image-a-39_1529781037200.jpg","title":"The downsizing lowdown make moving smaller home","story":"    Home comforts: The Greenhouse and Pavillion at Wadswick Green in WiltshireCraig Gibson, a partner at WDM Chartered Accountants, says: ‘Homes are a massive asset for people who have been committed to them for decades, so understanding your options is essential, especially when you’re selling.’And if you’re tempted to hand over your house or large chunks of money to your children, he says, ‘there are some ways to give your children cash or your home, but it’s very important to get good independent financial advice’. For instance, the annual allowance for tax-free gifts to children (or anyone else) is £3,000 per person. But parents can give up to £5,000 to children as wedding or civil-partnership gifts tax-free. Regular payments are exempt from inheritance tax, as long as they come from your income and not your savings and don’t significantly affect your lifestyle.When downsizing, it is important to consider what would be left to your children when you die.The inheritance-tax threshold currently stands at £325,000, and the rate payable on estates of more than that is 40 per cent of the amount above £325,000. The exception is if you are married, as you can pass your full estate to your spouse in the event of your death without paying inheritance tax. By doing this you also pass on your £325,000 inheritance-tax exemption, so £650,000 of your combined estate would then be free from inheritance tax.          Luxury living: One of Birchgrove\u0027s apartments in SidcupIf you go into residential care, you may have to sell your home to pay for it. One way to hold on to your home so you can pass the proceeds on to your children is to buy in a retirement development, like Wadswick Green in Wiltshire, where help is on hand for that care. However, exit fees that the development takes when you die will deplete any money you can pass on – as will service charges.Another option to free up money from your home is equity release. You have to be over 55 to go down this path, but it allows you to release money as a lump sum, or in several smaller amounts, or as a combination of both. And while equity-release products give you access to the cash in your home, they tend to be more expensive than regular mortgages and have associated fees. Triggering equity release may also affect your ability to claim state benefits.With so many people’s money in bricks and mortar – and with, these days, so many options available to those reaching retirement age – it’s no wonder that experts say it’s more important than ever before to look at ‘succession planning’.  Rent your way to riches In America, Australia and on the Continent, renting in retirement is much more popular than here.

Perched on top of the dome was a statue of Neptune, which protruded from the lake’s surface and was the only part of the structure visible from land.An air vent emerged through Neptune’s mouth and wisps of smoke were sometimes seen drifting out of it when Wright and his friends were enjoying cigars.To ensure clear views, Wright hired ers to keep the dome free from algae. Spellbound guests were able to watch fish and sometimes swimmers overhead. On summer nights, he switched off the lights so his friends could watch firework displays or gaze at the stars magnified by curved glass and water.A short flight of steps led to another underwater room with concrete walls and a curved ceiling supported on cast-iron columns. Lit by porthole-shaped skylights and equipped with a billiards table and card tables, this was the Lord of the Manor’s secret gaming room, where the men could head off for post-prandial fun.Run-down farmhouse which was bought for £300,000 then...There’s not much SPACE! Boatbuilder creates tiny...Share this articleThe ladies were catered for, too. From the gaming room, another staircase led to a stone viewing platform on the surface of the lake, where on summer afternoons his wife Anna and her friends could take tea.Wright’s tale has fascinated me ever since I first encountered this underwater hideaway while researching architectural follies. I wondered what sort of person could have built such a place. And the answer, I found, was a man the Victorians called the Napoleon of Finance, whose epic story – the subject of my new biography – was in many ways a forerunner of more modern financial disasters.Corpulent, grandiose and bull-necked, James Wright was an unlikely tycoon. Born in 1846, the eldest of five children of a Methodist preacher, he, too, became a minister before setting up a printing business in Halifax with his brother that promptly went bankrupt.The pair narrowly avoided prison, and on their father’s death, both emigrated to Toronto. Wright – by now using his middle name Whitaker – was lured by an oil boom to Philadelphia, where he met and married Anna in 1878. He set up a series of businesses, again sailing perilously close to the wind. In 1877, he and four partners were accused of making false claims in the prospectus of a new company and charged with conspiracy to defraud stockholders. Yet Wright escaped prosecution and, ever the adventurer, decided to became a prospector in America’s Wild West. An outgoing man with a quick wit and a ready charm, he made friends freely in saloons and gambling dens. Indeed, he enjoyed the rough-and-tumble boomtown life and later claimed he had witnessed ‘fierce revolver fights in the dancing halls’.          Deep secret: The underwater dome\u0027s 200 panes of glass were kept clean by a team of ersIt was in Leadville, Colorado, that he made his first fortune, talking up the prospects of a silver mine in 1880 and floating the company for $5 million (about £85 million in today’s money) on the New York stock exchange.By the time the business went bust, Wright had made a fat profit and was long gone. He repeated the trick in Utah, California, Nevada and New Mexico, where he set up a company that initially, at least, rewarded its investors handsomely.For the first five months it paid out $100,000 a month in idends as more than $1 million in silver was brought to the surface. The company’s share price soared, but again the bonanza did not last. In 1889, with his reputation tarnished and creditors breathing down his neck, he decided to reinvent himself in the land of his birth. Wright began promoting West Australian gold mines on the London stock exchange and, as the money rolled in like never before, he looked for a country property befitting of his enormous wealth, in part to prove to himself and his family that he had left that early disgrace in Halifax far behind.With money no object, he bought two tracts of land at Witley, near Godalming, paying £150,000 for the Lea Park estate, which included a 19th Century manor house, and £100,000 for the adjacent South Park Farm estate.Striding through his 9,000 acres, which contained 90 miles of roads and lanes, five lodges and ten farms, he set his swirling imagination to work. A small tributary of the River Wey meandered through the grounds, but Wright envisaged a series of great lakes, complete with islands. Most of the exotic ideas were his own. Under the direction of London architect Paxton Hood Watson, two wings were added to the existing manor house at the stupendous cost of £400,000.          Whitaker Wright was convicted of fraud in 2004The new west wing was adorned with a vast conservatory, which alone cost £10,000 (about £1 million today) and a large central glass dome filled with trees and exotic plants from across the world – a rival to Kew Gardens. The east wing, meanwhile, accommodated a domed observatory with a revolving copper roof.Between these two great embellishments were 32 bedrooms, 11 bathrooms and seven reception rooms, the largest of which, at more than 2,600 square feet, was the cedar-panelled ballroom, with a dancefloor capable of accommodating hundreds. Wright even found room for a small private hospital and, oddly, one of Britain’s first private velodromes.The stable block, capable of holding 50 horses, was a centrally heated equine palace with a viewing space from which visitors could admire their mounts from the comfort of leather-upholstered settees shaded by palms. Months of work resulted in the creation of the square lake, the bathing lake and the big lake. A boathouse was home to a flotilla of electric launches, sailing craft and rowing boats.It all came at quite a cost. Over the years his improvements to the estate cost an estimated £1,115,000 – then an extraordinary amount of money. But the overblown and impossibly extravagant house – he had a staff of 77 – was a perfect expression of his creator.In Queen Victoria’s diamond jubilee year of 1897, government Ministers and peers were among those who rushed to buy shares in his booming London and Globe Company and other mining-related companies.To impress investors, Wright made a point of appointing Establishment figures as directors. Future prime minister Arthur Balfour and members of the Spencer-Churchill family all invested. Even the Royal Family was said to have benefited.Whether or not these rumours were true, they were widely believed and Wright did nothing to dispel them. He established another Royal connection when he struck up a friendship with the spendthrift Sir James Reid, personal physician to Queen Victoria – in 1896 he sought Wright’s advice on how to make a killing on the stock market.To the world at large, it seemed he could do no wrong.But like the latter-day conman Charles Ponzi, inventor of the fraud scheme that bears his name, Wright’s business acumen was not as it seemed.          A dolphin\u0027s head water feature in the grounds of the estate which included lakes and islandsJust as in America, many of his much-vaunted mining prospects turned out to be duds and he used accounting tricks to make them appear solvent in annual accounts All such frauds must, eventually, come crashing down.And in a true fin de siècle moment, his house of cards collapsed on the last day of trading of the 19th Century.Panic spread in the stock market. Shares in Wright’s companies halved and 20 firms of stockbrokers were ruined.Wright fled to France and boarded a liner to New York, only to be arrested on arrival thanks to a transatlantic cable from Scotland Yard. He was brought back to London to stand trial.On January 26, 1904, he was convicted of fraud at the Royal Courts of Justice and given a seven-year prison sentence, but he evaded justice by swallowing cyanide in a court anteroom almost immediately afterwards.Magnificent as it was, Wright’s great project at Lea Park was never completed. After passing through a variety of owners, the big house burned down in 1952 and the buildings were demolished.The underwater dome, still watertight after 120 years, is now a Grade II-listed building – a monument not merely to folly, but to a life of extraordinary excess.lUltimate Folly: The Rises And Falls Of Whitaker Wright, by Henry Macrory, is published by Biteback at £20.

Arden’s quirky choice of name, which is traditionally spelt Niamh, has Irish roots and is said to mean ‘bright and radiant’          \u0027Over the next six weeks, we will do what every parent does and learn the little nuances of the way Neve wants to work,\u0027 Ms Arden told reporters          The parents beamed at their new baby girl           The couple thanked everyone who sent gifts and well wishes and promised to pay it forward          He called the birth experience a \u0027bit of a blur for both of us\u0027\u0027It was all a bit of a blur for the both of us but she had obviously been through so much and she just looked so happy.\u0027The couple went on to thank every single person who has congratulated, offered support, or provided gifts for them on this journey. \u0027Its mind blowing receiving messages from the Queen but it\u0027s equally important to us as everyone else who has taken the time to send us a note or a blanket.\u0027 \u0027Every knitted piece we have has been made by someone who has taken the time to sit down and knit it for us.\u0027\u0027It\u0027s absolutely beautiful,\u0027 she added. The family have decided to \u0027pay it forward\u0027 with all the gifts they have received. \u0027As soon as we\u0027re done with it we\u0027ll be sure to pass it all on to another family... another baby.\u0027             Ms Arden, 37, and her partner Clarke Gayford welcomed baby Neve Te Aroha Ardern-Gayford after her birth on Thursday afternoonMs Arden was the first world leader to have a baby in office in 30 years - and only the second ever.Ms Ardern, 37, and her partner Clarke Gayford announced the  birth of their first child, weighing 7lb 3oz, on Instagram.She follows in the footsteps of the late Pakistan prime minister Benazir Bhutto, who in 1990 became the only democratically-elected female world leader in recorded history to give birth while in power. \u0027Welcome to our village wee one,\u0027 Ms Ardern wrote on Instagram alongside a picture of her and Mr Gayford with their new arrival.\u0027Feeling very lucky to have a healthy baby girl that arrived at 4.45pm weighing 3.31kg (7.3lb) Thank you so much for your best wishes and your kindness. We\u0027re all doing really well thanks to the wonderful team at Auckland City Hospital.\u0027            \u0027Welcome to our village wee one,\u0027 the New Zealand prime minister posted on Instagram    New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, 37, went into labour with her first child on Thursday morning          The Prime Minister arrived at Auckland City Hospital accompanied by her partner Clarke Gayford on Thursday morning (pictured together)Ms Ardern\u0027s office said mother and child are doing well.\u0027I\u0027m sure we\u0027re going through all of the emotions new parents go through, but at the same time feeling so grateful for all the kindness and best wishes from so many people,\u0027 Ms Arden said in a statement. Ms Ardern was due on June 17. \u0027I hope we don\u0027t find ourselves in Barnaby\u0027s situation\u0027:...\u0027What if I get caught out?\u0027 Pregnant NZ PM Jacinda Ardern...Share this articleThe 37-year-old worked right up until she went into labour on Thursday morning.The New Zealand Government will be led by Winston Peters, 73, for the next six weeks.Ms Ardern assured she would still be on call, and the government would be business as usual. For more than a month, Ms Arden has talked down the significance of her leave, saying she\u0027ll still be receiving briefings and be available for major decisions or to discipline ministers if necessary.\u0027The thing to keep in mind is: I\u0027m not dead,\u0027 she told TVNZ.But while Ms Ardern has been working to assure the nation, Mr Peters has been causing a stir.He lodged a privacy breach lawsuit against a government department the day Ms Ardern left Wellington, recently scuttled a major piece of Labour policy and has attacked the leadership of the country\u0027s largest company.          Ms Ardern is set to make history as the first New Zealand Prime Minister to give birth while in the top seat          Following the birth, the government will be led by Winston Peters, 73, for six weeks. Ms Ardern (pictured at Polyfest in March) assured she would still be on call, and it would be business as usualDuring Ms Ardern\u0027s maternity leave, Mr Peters - the leader of the minority NZ First Party which forms part of New Zealand\u0027s coalition government - will have powers similar to those he would have if the prime minister was overseas.He will run the day-to-day operations in Wellington and will consult with Ms Ardern on \u0027significant political, strategic or public interest, or national security\u0027 matters.But he\u0027ll still be limited by the decisions of the Labour Party-dominated cabinet. Recent Newshub-Reid research polling found 39 per cent think Mr Peters will do a good job, the rest were either unsure or pessimistic.Often described as a populist, Mr Peters is the most experienced hand and one of the most iconic figures in the country\u0027s political landscape - but he is also polarising and has an often combative relationship with the media.He\u0027s formed coalition governments with both the centre-left and centre-right (playing the role of \u0027kingmaker\u0027 to leverage concessions out of the major parties), and since entering parliament in 1979 has held numerous senior cabinet posts, including deputy PM in the 1990s .          New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern (C) is the first PM to walk in the Pride Parade on February 17, 2018 in AucklandBut while he and Ms Ardern\u0027s Labour Party may not have seen eye-to-eye on some issues recently, they\u0027ve been talking up the trust between them.\u0027I\u0027ve almost found it surprising people have questioned that it will be anything other than business as usual for us,\u0027 Ms Ardern said.She became a mother just months after she took the country\u0027s top job in October.Ms Ardern announced she was pregnant in a Facebook post in January this year.          \u0027I\u0027ll be Prime Minister AND a mum, and Clarke will be \u0027first man of fishing\u0027 and stay-at-home dad,\u0027 she wrote on Facebook \u0027I\u0027ll be Prime Minister AND a mum, and Clarke will be \u0027first man of fishing\u0027 and stay-at-home dad,\u0027 she said at the time.\u0027I think it\u0027s fair to say that this will be a wee one that a village will raise but we couldn\u0027t be more excited.\u0027  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/24/13/4D9474FC00000578-5879277-image-a-144_1529842327383.jpg","title":"England step cauldron Nizhny Novgorod face Panama World Cup","story":"Harry Kane celebrates with Ashley Young after completing his hat-trick to put England 6-0 ahead against Panama in Russia          1-0: John Stones (number 5 shirt) heads in Kieran Trippier\u0027s corner to give England an early lead against Panama in the World Cup          2-0: England captain Harry Kane thumps in from the penalty spot to give England a two-goal lead against Panama this afternoon  3-0: England\u0027s Jesse Lingard curls a stunning effort past Panama\u0027s goalkeeper to give England a solid lead in Nizhny Novgorod          4-0: England\u0027s John Stones scores his side\u0027s fourth goal of the game in Nizhny Novgorod after Raheem Sterling\u0027s effort was saved          5-0: Harry Kane thumps in from the spot to give England an incredible five-goal lead against Panama before half time          6-0: Kane watches as he scores his fortuitous third goal to complete a hat-trick in England\u0027s rout against Panama at the World Cup          Jesse Lingard of England celebrates with teammates Harry Kane and Ruben Loftus-Cheek after scoring his team\u0027s third goal          Manchester City defender Stones (far right) crouches after heading England\u0027s first goal against Panama at the World Cup   England players celebrate after their side took an early lead in the World Cup match in Nizhny Novgorod          Rebekah Vardy (left) watches England take on Panama in Nizhny Novgorod in their second World Cup match this afternoon          England fans watching the World Cup match at the Isle of Wight Festival celebrate a goal against Panama in Russia      Aiming for the Tsars!

This series, developed from a film entitled Outremonde (Underworld) after the novel by Don DeLillo, was produced during the two months that Henno lived in Slab City in 2017. Even in an apocalyptic nightmare, Henno finds light: Revon and Michael become friends, then lovers after she introduces them, and Dave, a former drug- and alcohol-addicted evangelical pastor, creates a community vegetable patch in the desert.“I went back after a year and the bus in the picture was burned and Revon and Michael had gone their separate ways but the garden was growing,” Henno says. “There were even tomatoes.

These plaits and elaborate structures take anywhere between 30 minutes and five hours to create and can mark special occasions such as weddings and birthdays, denote a particular family or region or respond to political and artistic movements of the day. The acclaimed Nigerian photographer JD ’Okhai Ojeikere spent 40 years immortalising nearly 1,000 of these hairstyles, until his death in 2014. “Apart from being fascinated by their beauty and the artistic nature of each hairstyle, he documented them for posterity,” says his son, photographer Amaize Ojeikere. There is a danger, he adds, that these skills will be lost. “Particularly now the younger generation think it is ‘old-school’. That is one of the reasons the images were taken: to showcase the beauty of our people.” Structures of Identity will be at the Foam photography museum in Amsterdam from 29 June to 29 August.

So the perfect person to write it, she decided, was her best friend, Yomi Adegoke, then also 22 and working at Channel 4. “Because Yomi’s a\u0026nbspjournalist, I thought she would write it and I would market it,” says Uviebinené. “But she sold the idea back to me to both write it together.”So that’s what they did. It did not matter that they were both working long hours in highly competitive careers – they wrote every evening and weekend for the next year. Nor that neither had written a book before – they simply Googled “how to write a book” and set up focus groups with friends to discover the breadth of what they needed to research.Taking the dictum to work twice as hard to get half as far as their white counterparts – which they believe is one of the only ways for black communities to succeed in Britain – they secured a book deal a year later, despite the outrageous odds against two black women with no inside connections to an overwhelmingly white, elitist publishing industry.It was not just any book deal either. Slay in Your Lane: The Black Girl Bible is arguably the book for 2018, fought for in a nine-way publishers’ auction with Uviebinené and Adegoke receiving – to their astonishment – a five-figure sum.Uviebinené was at work when she got the phone call from her agent. She hid in the office loos and made a breathless call to Adegoke. “I was trying to Whatsapp Yomi from the top of Canary Wharf tower, trying to explain what had just happened and I felt so overwhelmed.”Adegoke was celebrating her 25th birthday in Rio de Janeiro. “I had just broken up with a boyfriend and I wanted to go away after one year of working intensely. I was having a really great time and I’d lost my phone for the previous few days.”Both are 26 now. They met as 18-year-old freshers at the University of Warwick. There they found themselves marooned and misunderstood in an almost uniformly white environment that seemed unconsciously hostile. Adegoke took a year out from Warwick after suffering from depression (she turned this into a productive experience by founding a magazine titled Birthday).“Her confidence was mistaken for arrogance,” explains Uviebinené. “It was ‘us’ against everyone else.”“Yeah,” adds Adegoke, “We’ve both been through a lot. It’s one of the reasons we get on so well. There is a lot of respect there.”Both are of Nigerian heritage – Uviebinené’s father came to Britain when she was two (leaving behind her mother, from whom she is estranged) and she is the eldest of six children. Adegoke was born and raised in Croydon, south London, and has two sisters to whom she is very close. Uviebinené has become a kind of third sister: she moved in with Adegoke’s family in 2016 and has lived there since.The book looks at the mechanics of succeeding at school and in the workplace within a greater system that is structurally tilted against British black communities (they back this up with a barrage of statistical research). In it, they talk of the “concrete ceiling”, “impenetrable glasshouses”, the “long, back-door route into success” and of such flagrant bias at work that some black candidates have fared better by sending in job applications using aliases.They grapple with issues around health, dating and representation that are specific to black female experience. What is most impressive is the book’s penetrating research as well as its argument. “Well, if you are going to call a book ‘the black girl bible’, you have to do your research, and incorporate the full cross-section of black women’s concerns,” says Uviebinené.Adegoke nods vigorously. “In the past year and a half, our lives have been dedicated to making sure we get this right. It’s been the most challenging thing we’ve ever done. I don’t know that I would have a book deal without Elizabeth.”“We are each other’s champions,” Uviebinené shoots back. “Yomi is one of the most confident and articulate people I know.”There are many such tender exchanges. They are friends who seem more like sisters, though in temperament they are yin and yang. Uviebinené turns up bang on time and is calmly composed and earnest. Adegoke, who arrives late, is a whirlwind of energy. They do not talk over each other or finish each other’s sentences but seem to know what the other will say. Much of this sisterliness and fierce spirit of “strength in adversity” is channelled into their book. Uviebinené says it was written for her younger self, and all those girls and women who, like her in those formative years, are trying to figure out who they are in the world, and how they can succeed at life. “When I was 16, I’d write notes to myself every time things got hard on the type of person I wanted to be. I was always looking to what life held for me. So this book is about what I wanted to know when I was 16, and 18, and 21, that popular culture wasn’t telling me.” It also gives young black girls a host of role models or “cheerleaders” that the authors believe are badly needed. They interview 39 accomplished black women for their perspectives on success, from Malorie Blackman to Laura Mvula, June Sarpong, Denise Lewis, Jamelia, Margaret Busby and Estelle. Young girls need to “see it to be it”, they say, quoting Dr Karen Blackett, chair of MediaCom, from the book’s foreword, and such cheerleaders were not always visible while they were growing up.Uviebinené found inspiration in older women who accomplished great things, while for Adegoke, it came from closer to home. “My older sister, Yemisi, is a journalist for BBC Africa. She always told us dark skin was beautiful. She made sure we didn’t have issues around it. She was like a third parent, making sure we grew up confident.”Since Uviebinené’s lightbulb moment in 2015, the subject of ersity has exploded in publishing. Bestselling books by Reni Eddo-Lodge and Afua Hirsch have shown the industry that there is an immense appetite for a conversation around race and inequality in Britain.What do they feel about this moment? “Liz was trying to set the agenda, not follow it,” says Adegoke. “So we didn’t think: ‘This will work because black girls have traction right now.’”But they welcome the drive for better representation. “We see it as a blessing that our book has coincided with a trend for ersity,” says Adegoke. “We can see that just as it is in fashion now it can fall out of fashion. But then again, black women are not going anywhere. We don’t fall off the planet when we’re not in fashion. We’ll still here and we believe we’ve written a good book, and that people will read it, even if people get bored of ersity.”Is it relevant to non-black readers, too, and inspiring girls across the range? “I think non-black people should read it to understand the experience of what it means to be a black woman. I have been reading books that have not been written for me all my life,” says Adegoke.For Uviebinené, intersectionality is key in feminism: “You can sing from one voice but it’s also not as straightforward as that. You need to see your privilege for what it is first. Feminism for me is about gaining choices and breaking down the insidious structures that hold us back. White women tend to want to be more like white men in their privilege. I don’t want to be more like white women.”Do they think unequal structures are slowly being broken down, and that Britain is changing? After all, a mixed-race woman recently married into royalty. “I don’t think Meghan Markle massively marked a change. It’s Harry’s choice, not an institutional choice, though I do think she could be an agent of change for women,” says Adegoke. “But if Harry had brought home a girl who looked like us – black girls with kinky hair and big noses – it would be a very different conversation.”They swap a look again, a kind of signal that they have each other’s backs. What about boyfriends, I ask. Where do they sit within their friendship? “My boyfriend is basically a version of Liz – a short, dark-skinned Taurus.” Does he get on with Uviebinené? Adegoke shrugs as if this is a no-brainer. “They have to love her. Of course.”• Elizabeth Uviebinené and Yomi Adegoke will join Afua Hirsch for a  Live event on Wednesday 25 July at Kings Place, London N1• Slay in Your Lane: The Black Girl Bible is published next month by Fourth Estate (£16.99).

Her 2011 nonfiction memoir How to Be a Woman is an international bestseller, while How to Build a Girl, the first novel in her semi-autobiographical trilogy about\u0026nbspa teenager called Johanna Morrigan, is being made into a feature film. Its sequel, How to Be Famous, is out on Thursday (Ebury Press, £14.99).This is your third book with a ‘how to’ title. How come?I like writing useful books. I didn’t go to school. Everything I learned was from reading everything that interested me in Wolverhampton’s Warstone’s library. With a “how to” title you know what you’re going to get. If you call it, like, The Crying of Dolphins, people think: “Hmm, is that relevant to me?” Every book of mine is a list of topics I haven’t seen addressed, taboos that need to be busted, secrets that need to be told, things that I want to boggle at. What is everybody else not talking about or too scared to talk\u0026nbspabout?Although your new novel, with its plot about a powerful man sexually exploiting younger women, is very in tune with what everyone’s talking\u0026nbspabout.Yes, imagine sitting here every day and going on Twitter and you’re like: “Shit, this is literally the plot to this book!” I’d had the idea for 10 years. It was always about sexual shame, a tape, and becoming famous for the wrong reasons. When something awful happens and you become news, how do you deal with that? Revenge porn is a huge thing now for younger women.\u0026nbspJohanna realises she needs to speak out. She’s saying: “Take your shame, it’s not mine.” And that was what the #MeToo movement was doing on a global scale. And it’s\u0026nbspworking! These fuckers are going to go to jail, it’s changing the industry.Johanna’s defiance seems to embody that of the #MeToo movement.What’s really important in the book is that Johanna would not be able to get to that defiance if she had not met Suzanne. Her friend Suzanne is older, she’s been through more, and she gives Johanna a platform. This is the thing that’s missing on social media, particularly in activism, it’s all young people with their anger. I wanted to write about female friendships and feminist mentors. We need more of that at the moment with activism. We tend to kill or ignore our tribal elders.Who is your feminist mentor?I loved Germaine Greer growing up – obviously she’s problematic now – but she wasn’t scared and I absolutely couldn’t imagine not being scared. Also when I was 17, Courtney Love took me under her wing – Suzanne is a bit based on her – I interviewed her a couple of times.Your books and your sitcom Raised By Wolves are based on your real life. Do you ever worry that you’ll run out of\u0026nbspmaterial?Within the panoply of fat, clever, working-class girls who really like to shag – I don’t think we’re overserved for those role models yet. Also, teenage girls are a cipher. Their concerns tell you precisely what the problems are with being an adult woman in any era. And right now, one in 10 teenage girls is being referred to mental health services. Girls are rejecting the idea of being an adult woman.Do you think it’s the worst time to be a teenage girl?We’ve heaped a whole load of pressure on these women. My generation had it easy. When I was a teenager the Berlin Wall had come down, we were all taking ecstasy and running around like Pac-Men in nightclubs going “everything’s going\u0026nbspto be great, hooray for liberalism”. We see these things being reversed now: the property and the jobs market have changed, there’s a rise in nationalism and\u0026nbsppopulism. The thing is, the internet foregrounds all of our disagreements and we don’t have anywhere where we see all of our progress. What’s your next book?A sequel to How to Be a Woman. I’m going to do trans issues, caring, mental illness, anxiety, ageing. I’m very excited.And how’s the film adaptation of How to Build a Girl going?It feels like a big fuss to make a film. When you’re writing a script, you’re writing about getting drunk on a bus. Some poor fucker is going to have to find a period-appropriate bus, clear a street, find actors... It’s such a hoo-ha. It’s really mortifying. But it is magic.Were you involved in the casting of Beanie Feldstein (the best friend in Greta Gerwig’s film Lady Bird) as you?Oh yes. The producers hadn’t been truthful with me that the chances of finding a big actress with the range to play a teenager who is clever, unusual and funny, but who’s also big enough to front a movie, were infinitesimal. We tend not to have big actresses, they just look at Hollywood and go, ‘Well there’s no point me being an actress. I’m just going to be the fat, funny friend.’ That she was invented just in time to do this movie is joyful. She’s going to be a huge star. She glows.What’s currently on your bedside table?I’m reading A History of God by Karen Armstrong. I’m working on a couple of projects where I look at the origins of God. Why did we invent\u0026nbspthis guy? And what’s his relevance now?Is there an author that you always return to?I reread The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole pretty much every year. It’s extraordinary. It’s that thing you see so often in female writers – Nina Stibbe’s another one – to write something light, brilliant and frothy is incredibly hard. It’s like making bread: you have to knead that fucking dough for a long time to make it light as a feather. Anyone can write a serious, miserable book.What book might people be surprised to find on your bookshelf?If they saw how badly I spelled, they’d probably be surprised that I have a dictionary. I still don’t really know\u0026nbspanything about grammar or\u0026nbspspelling.And they’re big on grammar at school these days.It breaks my heart. Some of my stuff is set texts at GCSE and A-level, so I get kids saying: “We’re analysing you today, why have you used a past participle there?” And I literally don’t have a clue. I learned to write by reading. I tell my kids there’s probably something in this house that will be more use to you than the stuff you’re learning at school.Are they fans of your work?No! Who wants to read their mum writing about masturbation? We did an Easter egg hunt and one of the clues was hidden in my book and they refused to open it. The shits.

Aside from the occasional bit of scatological humour (scatology being the study of faeces … delightful), most of us happily steer away from regularly talking about it, for fairly obvious reasons.But, if you push past the initial icky revulsion of talking about human waste, you’d find out that it actually contains a vast amount of potential value in terms of energy, providing a sustainable form of fuel that we could all help supply.In 2015, research by the United Nations University found that human waste was a potential fuel source and if all of it was collected worldwide, annually it would be “great enough in theory to generate electricity for up to 138m households” – which is all of Indonesia, Brazil, and Ethiopia combined. An equivalent amount of natural gas would cost $9.5bn (£6.7bn).Poo-powered innovations are already happening, too. Earlier this year, a Worcestershire man made headlines when, fed-up with seeing bags littered across the scenic Malvern Hills, he designed a street lamp that runs on dog poo – two hours of light for every 10 bags of poo.There are companies across the UK that are also starting to explore the potential of poo power on a larger scale. Bristol-based renewable energy company GENeco is using sewage waste from the city to create green gas, which is then supplied to homes across the UK by Bristol Energy.“When sewage waste arrives at GENeco’s treatment plant in Bristol, it is treated and turned into what’s called ‘sludge’,” explains Bristol Energy renewables and origination manager Simon Proctor. “This forms the raw fuel for the anaerobic digestion plant.”During anaerobic digestion, organic matter – in this case, the sewage sludge – is broken down by microorganisms in an airtight container Proctor compares it to “the way a cow’s stomach breaks down grass”.This process produces methane-rich biogas, which is treated to remove impurities and ensure emissions are odour-free. The enriched biomethane is then injected into the gas distribution network. “It has the same quality as natural gas, and can be used in our homes as an alternative to fossil fuels,” Proctor says.The results are impressive. According to Bristol Energy, an average household’s weekly flushes could produce enough biomethane to cook a fry-up two weeks’ flushes could cook a roast dinner and annual flushes from every household in Bristol could fry 83m eggs.Biomethane was also used as fuel by GENeco to run a “Bio-Bus” shuttle to and from Bath and Bristol airport and also on a regular bus service within Bristol, aptly named the “number two route”. The bus travelled more than 180 miles on a tank of gas produced by the annual food and sewage waste of just five passengers.Sustainability is at the heart of the entire process. “Producing biomethane from sewage waste means that we don’t have to use fossil fuels,” Proctor says. “Burning fossil fuels is one of the biggest sources of CO2 emissions in the UK. Switching the average UK home to renewable energy can save more than 1.5 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year, that’s equivalent to taking a car off the road for six months.”He also points out that while we can try to reduce other forms of waste, such as packaging, plastic or food, reducing the level of sewage waste “is obviously going to be more difficult” – making the process an important step towards a more sustainable world.Bristol Energy will also invest its profits back into the city, creating what Proctor calls a “circular economy”. “Sewage waste from Bristol is recycled into green gas our customers switch to a locally owned company and save money – and then our profits will go back into the local community,” he says.That doesn’t mean there aren’t drawbacks, however, particularly in terms of the adoption of the process. Installation and maintenance costs for anaerobic digestion systems can be high, and many companies have been forced to rely on government initiatives to keep running. Proctor says that support under such schemes has been “very ambiguous at times”, which could be, in part, what is preventing more companies from adopting similar systems.Prof Chris Metcalfe, director of the Institute for Watershed Science at Trent University in Canada, worked on the UN study into human waste. He believes that biogas should be considered a resource not only for energy production, but also as compost “for improving agricultural productivity” and for the recycling of water for irrigation.“In most cases, we’re wasting this resource by either putting the solids into landfill or by discharging the liquid sewage into lakes and rivers,” he says.The main issue, Metcalfe believes, is not the technology – in fact, he says there are no real technological barriers to the use of human waste as fuel. Instead, it’s “people’s attitudes about using human waste” that causes problems. “In many countries, the idea of collecting and using human waste is not culturally acceptable, even though animal manure is often used for biogas production,” Metcalfe explains.But Proctor says human waste is already being used more widely than we may think. This is evident across the world, where the process is increasingly being used to improve sanitation in developing countries. In India, where $20bn (around £14bn) of government funding has recently been put towards building sanitary toilets, social project SHRI (Sanitation and Health Rights India) uses an anaerobic biodisgestion system to provide electricity to pump ground water that is later filtered and sold, with profits paying for the ongoing maintenance of the toilets.It may not be glamorous, sexy or particularly futuristic it may still seem slightly icky. But it’s undeniable: whether it’s being used to fuel cars, buses or homes in the UK, or to improve sanitation conditions across the world, poo has the power to change lives.To find out more about how you can support green energy and save money on your bills, visit bristol-energy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99bbd6e41e83f2d781e626867979fba409f8e948/270_24_3205_1923/master/3205.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca5c3d0e1a604bec0fedd53edfb81a32","title":"energy minister faces questions as swansea tidal lagoon plan left in limbo","story":"Tidal Lagoon Power has to cut headcount after delays over decision on £1.3bn projectBritain’s energy minister will have to explain to MPs why no decision has been made on whether to support a tidal lagoon in Swansea – nearly 18 months after an independent government review backed the plan.Claire Perry will face the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee on Monday afternoon to answer questions on the £1.3bn clean energy project, which has been left in limbo.Tidal Lagoon Power, the Gloucester-based firm that wants to harness the power of the tides across the UK’s west coast, has been forced to cut its headcount from 50 to 30 as a result of the delays.Downing Street had said an announcement was due on the clean energy project nearly a fortnight ago but nothing has materialised. Government sources have suggested the scheme will be turned down on cost grounds.A decision could come before the hearing with Perry on Monday but that is thought unlikely.Energy industry figures said the government’s slow process risked the UK losing out as global companies choose other countries in which to invest.“Clearly the more you delay decision-making, the more timetables slip, then the more uncomfortable people feel about making their own business decisions,” Louise Kingham, the chief executive of the Energy Institute, told the .“There is a danger that investment capital can go somewhere else.” Tidal Lagoon Power last week wrote to the business secretary, Greg Clark, and the first minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones, arguing that the lagoon would contribute more than £2bn to the UK economy over its lifetime.The firm said the project could be built for a guaranteed price of power, known as a contract for difference (CfD), at the same level as that awarded for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset. “Subject to a mutually agreed arrangement with the Welsh government, which is under discussion, the pathfinder tidal range project in the UK requires the same level of CfD support as new nuclear power station Hinkley Point C,” a company presentation said.The government, by contrast, has said it believes the lagoon would be twice as expensive as Hinkley.

Though they never explicitly acknowledged that taxes might have to go up during this parliament, Theresa May and Philip Hammond signalled this could be so when they dropped many of the pledges inherited from David Thingy and George Whatnot. Anyone with a basic diploma in political semaphore could intuit that this meant that there was a strong possibility that taxes would rise.Possibility has turned into racing certainty. That is one conclusion we can draw from Mrs May’s announcement that there will be £20bn extra per year for the NHS by 2023. Even the magic money tree can’t produce that kind of cash without some watering by the taxman. This is more than the chancellor wanted to sign off on before Jeremy Hunt, the wily survivor as health secretary, managed to persuade the prime minister that money would be the most popular 70th birthday present\u0026nbspfor the NHS.While the new financial settlement is more generous than the chancellor wanted, the money is less than many analysts think the NHS needs if it is to handle the pressures of an ageing and growing population. A recent joint study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Health Foundation suggests that the spending trajectory proposed by the government may only just about sustain a “status quo” NHS. So headlines suggesting the rise is “dramatic” are misleading, as is Mrs May’s rhetoric about a “profound transformation”. Spin today, repent at leisure. That is my free advice to her propagandists. Some of the hyperbolic descriptions attached to this extra money will do the government more harm than good in the long run if they excite anticipation of radical improvements that do not then materialise.That is one reason why the Conservatives would be foolish to imagine that they will get much credit. Another reason to doubt that there will be joyful whooping in hospital corridors is that there is no such thing as enough when it comes to NHS spending. Staff and users often express their love for the health service, but that is rarely accompanied by any gratitude towards the politicians in charge of it. The NHS received exceptionally enhanced funding when Tony Blair was in office. His big increment in spending did show up in improved provision, falling waiting times and record public satisfaction, but this did not guarantee a smooth ride for his health secretaries. On one memorable occasion, Patricia Hewitt got a torrid reception from the Royal College of Nursing when the annual convocation of the angels booed her like the devil.For Tories, it is invariably worse. Voters are inveterately suspicious of Conservative intentions towards the NHS. In the competition with Labour to be regarded as best for health, the most Tories can aspire to achieve is a position of “neutral”. Mr Cameron achieved that in opposition, only then to throw away the benefit of the doubt in government by allowing the Lansley reorganisation that no one had voted for and fewer understood.So the best-case scenario for the Conservatives is not that this money will be transformative of the NHS and public trust in the Tories. The most they can hope for is that the money will shore up a vulnerable flank by preventing a series of rolling and roiling health funding crises up to the next election. Labour will say the money is not enough. This might be true, but the public will be conscious, and may discount accordingly, that Labour always says the Tories are not spending enough on health. The Tory aim is to reduce the salience of health as a cause of public discontent and make it less probable that the state of the NHS will induce swing voters to support Labour rather than them at the next election.There is still a huge hole in the government’s plans. Where is the money going to come from? Jeremy Corbyn made a bit of a hash of posing this question at his most recent encounter with the prime minister. Asking where the money is coming from to pay for spending promises is not natural territory for the leader of the Labour party. That doesn’t make it a bad question and Theresa May has yet to come up with a coherent answer. She has suggested that some extra cash will be provided by a “Brexit idend”. And the tooth fairy is visiting me tonight, the moon is made of cheese and Elvis lives on Atlantis where he and Lord Lucan ride their pet unicorns. There is no “Brexit idend” for the NHS – or for anything else. Everyone knows this is a fantasy. The government has itself accepted the Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecast that the public finances will be weaker, not stronger, as a result of Brexit.It is generally supposed at Westminster that Mrs May made herself complicit in this Johnsonian fabrication in the hope that it will induce the hard Brexiters in her party to swallow some of the concessions she is going to have to make in the negotiations with the EU. Even if it has that effect, and I’m highly sceptical, it was foolish of Mrs May to parrot that most mendacious piece of Leaver baloney.So where will the money come from? It is hard to see how it can be found by cutting elsewhere. As I remarked a few weeks ago, there are significant spending pressures on other departments and electoral challenges for the Tories virtually across the spectrum of government activity. Sajid Javid has buried the truncheon with the Police Federation by as good as telling them that he’ll be fighting the Treasury to secure improved funding. There is Tory backbench pressure to relieve the squeeze on school budgets. Gavin Williamson has already fallen out with the chancellor over the condition of the armed forces and the defence secretary now seems to be going to war with the prime minister as well. Local government has already had central government support slashed by nearly a half since 2010. There’s nothing left to cut from housing and transport.The chancellor indicated his irritation with the health\u0026nbspsettlement by telling the cabinet that the bill for Mr Hunt’s boost will be paid for by the rest of them with a continuing clamp on all other departmental budgets. The Treasury then briefed the media that other spending ministers will remain strapped in austerity straitjackets. Good luck to the chancellor with holding that line if he does not have the reliable support of the prime minister.She edged towards candour when she acknowledged that taxes are going to rise “across the nation” while claiming this would happen “in a fair and balanced way”. What she didn’t say is which taxes. In this case, it is not because she is being dishonest, but because she simply doesn’t know. A hypothecated health tax has been shot down. The Treasury hates that concept and there are big problems with linking NHS funding to the ebbs and flows of the economy. A wealth tax is an idea that has been gaining support among some Tories. They favour it both for the revenues it could produce and because asking for a larger contribution to the exchequer from asset-rich baby boomers might be represented as an act of intergenerational fairness. The obvious target of a wealth tax is property, but that is politically perilous, as Mrs May discovered when the “dementia tax” blew up her campaign during the last election. There are a lot of affluent baby boomers with property wealth among Tory members and MPs.One way to bring in more is to freeze income tax thresholds. The Treasury has often used this as a sneaky method of harvesting extra revenue. But Tory MPs are alert to that, many do not like it and it would breach one of the tax promises that they did commit to in their last manifesto. Any kind of tax rise sticks in the throat of many Tories. Hiking taxes is not what they think they came into politics to do. Getting tax increases through parliament will be additionally tough when the government lacks a majority.Mrs May has made this dilemma even thornier by separating the announcement of the extra spending for the NHS from Mr Hammond’s next budget, which is not until November. Five months will have passed by then and the extra health funding will be a fading headline, while tax rises will be a live and hot issue of the day.The health service may have been promised its birthday present, but it has been bought on political tick.\u0026nbspWe still don’t know who will pay for it. Neither does\u0026nbspthe prime minister or the chancellor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7818df2c1f85a045e74b64e9a6d885085b83372b/0_0_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3a0c6ed61028481608a49393513a6ae","title":"coral reefs overwhelmed by rising oceans","story":"Scientists have uncovered a new threat to the world’s endangered coral reefs. They have found that most are incapable of growing quickly enough to compensate for rising sea levels triggered by global warming.The study suggests that reefs – which are already suffering serious degradation because the world’s seas are warming and becoming more acidic – could also become overwhelmed by rising oceans.Sea levels rose by several inches over the past century and measurements indicate the speed of this increase is now rising significantly. Two key factors are involved: climate change is making ocean water warmer and so it expands. And as ice sheets and glaciers melt, they increase amounts of water in the oceans.At the same time, reefs are being weakened by ocean warming and also by ocean acidification, triggered as more and more the seas absorb more and more carbon dioxide. These effects lead to bleaching events that kill off vast stretches of coral and limits their ability to grow.“Our predictions, even under the best case scenarios, suggest that by 2100 the inundation of reefs will expose coastal communities to significant threats of shoreline change,” said co-author Prof Peter Mumby of Queensland University.This point was backed by US marine scientist Ilsa Kuffner writing in a separate comment piece for Nature. “The implications of the study are dire.

Anna Faris plays Kate, an overworked single parent who cons amnesiac yacht owner Leonardo (Eugenio Derbez) into thinking he is her husband.

Although Faris is not in the role originally played by Hawn (Goldie was the spoilt heiress to Russell’s widowed carpenter), she channels her predecessor’s acting style, going all out with the bubbly, goofy ditz act.

The opposition will not always be this obliging and nobody, surely, can expect Harry Kane to keep scoring so prodigiously throughout the rest of the World Cup. Maybe England have peaked too soon. And no doubt the most overheard line over the next 24 hours will be that, yes, it was only Panama. Stay calm, it was only Panama.All the same, it was difficult to come away from the latest win for Gareth Southgate’s increasingly convincing side without the overwhelming feeling that it has been a long time since an England team have played this freely. It was their biggest World Cup victory – since the 3-0 against Denmark in 2002 – and at half-time, no kidding, there were people in the press box flicking through the history books to find out how many more goals were needed to establish the biggest ever win in World Cup history.England were 5-0 ahead at that time courtesy of two penalties from Kane, supplemented by two headed goals from John Stones and a beauty from Jesse Lingard. Kane’s hat-trick followed in the 63rd minute and, after that, it came as a jolt that the only other goal was off a Panamanian boot. Hungary’s 10-1 win against El\u0026nbspSalvador in 1982 will have to wait for another day. Thursday, perhaps, when Belgium are the opposition, to establish which team wins Group\u0026nbspG.Already, though, it is mission accomplished as far as qualification is concerned and, on this evidence, it is no exaggeration to say England should not fear anybody. Kane is now the leading scorer in the tournament and Gary Lineker is the only player, through all the ages, who has managed more than his five goals. Yet the acclaim here should not just apply to Kane when Stones has been so effective in either penalty area, when Kieran Tripper’s supply line has been so instrumental and Lingard is emerging as a genuine category-A player.England had never before scored five first-half goals and it is only the third time in the history of this team, out of 24 attempts, when they have begun any major tournament by winning back-to-back matches, emulating the World Cups of 1982 and 2006. It is still only two games but, slowly but surely, something important is happening. England are becoming the team their supporters want them to be. And it is great fun.Panama’s ordeal did at least include the consolation of a 76th-minute goal for the substitute Felipe Baloy and their supporters were still partying at the end. Ultimately, though, the imbalance of talent was far too great for a team fielding four players from Major League Soccer and others from the Romanian and Slovakian leagues. Panama had to resort to other measures. They argued with the officials. Their goalkeeper, Jaime Penedo, briefly seemed to be threatening a one-man protest before Kane’s first penalty, and it was incredible, in particular, sometimes to see their tactics when they were defending England’s corners.Even by modern standards, it was rare to see a set of players so dedicated to restricting the mobility, WWE-style, of their opponents. It led to Kane’s penalty, to make it 5-0, when Aníbal Godoy manhandled him to the floor. Yet that was the norm, rather than the exception, as far as Panama were concerned and an argument could be made that they also got their just desserts for the opening goal.For that one, Harry Maguire had already been brought to his knees twice because of Gabriel Gómez’s attempts to pin him down. Godoy was clinging to Kane like a mollusc on the side of an old ship. Twice, the corner had to be delayed to sort out all the chaos. Nobody, however, seemed to designate Stones as a potential danger. Trippier swung the ball over from the right, Jordan Henderson took out a couple of defenders with his run to the near-post and Stones followed in to power in his header from eight yards.Eight minutes had gone and already it was clear it was going to be harder to like Panama than many of us imagined. Indeed, England ought to have had a penalty inside the first 90 seconds after Gómez swung an elbow into Lingard’s jaw. A repeat offender, Gómez went down clutching his own face and the Egyptian referee, Gehad Grisha, was taken in by the deception. Later in the first half, an elbow from Armando Cooper left blood coming from Maguire’s nose. Román Torres responded to Maguire’s complaints by flicking his opponent’s nose and then putting in his forehead like a rutting stag. Southgate had told his players not to react to any provocation and they did not let him down.Instead, this was a performance that brought to mind the old line from Frank Sinatra that the best revenge is massive success. Kane’s first penalty came from Fidel Escobar bundling over Lingard. Kane struck the ball high, to the goalkeeper’s right, in a manner reminiscent of Alan Shearer. For good measure, he also did the same for the fifth goal.Lingard’s was the pick of the goals, exchanging passes with Raheem Sterling before running across the line of the penalty area, left to right, and curling a shot that went in off the underside of the crossbar. Yet the fourth goal was brilliantly worked, too. This time, Trippier played a free-kick short to Henderson. His cross was headed down by Kane and Stones nodded in the rebound after Penedo had blocked Sterling’s first effort.The second half was an exercise in damage limitation for Panama and, to give them their due, Kane’s hat-trick goal was a fluke. Ruben Loftus-Cheek let fly from 20 yards and the ball flicked off Kane’s instep to loop in. England’s lingering imperfections were briefly exposed when Baloy turned in a free-kick from the left. No matter. England can still enjoy the view from the top of Group\u0026nbspG, with the same goal difference as Belgium but ahead on fair-play rules. Nobody should get too carried away but, good heavens, it is hard sometimes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed706f356624498abcd854e92eb9b9fcb5670623/0_170_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c9c7846b58e1cd2d5a52ae82a721564","title":"germany sweden world cup toni kroos turning point unhapiness moscow","story":"In all my time watching football, there have been few goals that have changed so much. At 1-1 against Sweden, Germany were as good as out of the World Cup, and carrying out my duties as a pundit for ARD from Baden-Baden I was not looking forward to doing the post-match analysis. But then Toni Kroos scored and the next thing I know everyone – myself included – is jumping up, screaming and celebrating. It was a mix of relief and joy and showed just how much the national team mean to Germans.Kroos has said there are people back home who want Germany to lose that’s only true for a minority, as seen by how we, and millions of Germans, reacted to his goal. We always want them to do well and from a personal point of view the most pleasing aspect of Saturday night was the attitude of the players. They showed the right reaction to going 1-0 behind – sticking together and not giving up, which more than formations and lineups are the basic principles of football.It will not be easy against South Korea on Wednesday but I do expect Germany to win and thus qualify for the knockout stages. And if the team continue to improve by even a few per cent each time they play, there is no doubt the quality is there for them to go a long way.Germany certainly need to improve if they are to retain the World Cup. What was most concerning about the display on Saturday was how they started well but looked immediately vulnerable as soon as Antonio Rüdiger made the first mistake of the match. Suddenly the structure and any sense of a gameplan vanished and were it not for a combination of a bit of luck and another outstanding display from Manuel Neuer, Germany could easily have found themselves 2-0 down.Fortunately Marco Reus scored an equaliser very early in the second half and from there everything went back to normal. Germany pushed and pushed and, right at the death, Kroos showed why he is the man for big occasions. It’s not easy keeping a calm head at such moments but that is exactly what he did.I expect changes for the game against South Korea. For starters, Jérôme Boateng cannot play having been sent off against Sweden. Mats Hummels should come in for him having missed the game with an injury. Sebastian Rudy, having been a surprise pick on Saturday, may also miss out with the broken nose he sustained in the first half, and there could also be a return for Mesut Özil.Özil’s omission against Sweden was a huge talking point in Germany – he simply is not dropped for big games. I sincerely hope that he is motivated even more now and shows his qualities when called upon by Joachim Löw. And the deeper Germany go in this tournament, the more important Özil could become.The win on Saturday has raised the general mood in Germany and hopefully has done the same within the squad in Russia. It is an open secret that the players are not enjoying their camp in Moscow and would have much preferred to be in Sochi, where they played on Saturday and were based during the successful Confederations Cup campaign last year.A camp is really important for a squad when they are going to be together for potentially up to five weeks – it has to be just right. That was certainly the case in Brazil four years ago when the players all spoke about how nice it was to be based by the beach, how it lifted their mood before and after games. They wanted a similarly relaxing atmosphere this time around but haven’t got that.Saying that, the players cannot make excuses for failing to reach the levels expected of them. This is a decent squad and there are too many experienced players who have not yet reached their top form, for example Thomas Müller.He is not the only one and hopefully after Saturday’s game we will see a different Germany. I believe we will. One goal changed everything and for Germans there is once again reason to feel hugely optimistic about Die\u0026nbspMannschaft."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7c2ad0d1245565ecfdd366dcc4fba4bf3d4b2e3/0_144_3864_2319/master/3864.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f8b519d30e229556cd572cb7feb9b77","title":"toni kroos freekick germany sweden joachim low","story":"Toni Kroos had to blot out the background noise and, boy, was there a lot of it. The buildup to Germany’s second Group F match against Sweden on Saturday night had been full of loathing, full of recrimination, and nobody in Joachim Löw’s team had been under any illusions as to the consequences of failure.Germany are simply not supposed to lose World Cup games, particularly not the opening one of the group stage, and the fall-out from the 1-0 defeat by Mexico from the previous Sunday had been extraordinary. Some of the criticism was personal and the squad had come to believe that a section of their countrymen and women wanted them to fail, wanted them to lose to Sweden and exit the finals.It is probably worth reminding ourselves that it had been one defeat. Yes, it was particularly grisly, a meltdown that had hinted at the end of the Löw era, but it was still only one defeat. In his eight previous tournaments, including the Confederations Cup, Löw has always reached the semi-finals, at least. The last time Germany had failed to advance from the first round of a World Cup was in 1938.Perhaps, it explains the intolerance of any slip so early in a competition. But it also shone a light on the exacting standards to which the Nationalmannschaft are held and the winning mentality that is ingrained into German football. Löw and the players deserved the criticism. They had to take it.Kroos stood over the free-kick and it was not exactly well placed – to the left of the Sweden penalty area, the angle unkind. The stadium clock showed that the five minutes of stoppage-time were almost up and so were Germany’s World Cup hopes because a 1-1 scoreline, as it stood, was not going to cut it. A draw would mean Germany relinquishing control of their destiny. The criticism would once again have been brutal.On a personal level, Kroos had erred for the Sweden goal – his uncharacteristically loose pass setting in motion the counterattack for Ola Toivonen’s lovely finish. He knew it. Since the 32nd minute, it had sat with him. Kroos was in line to be a villain.Everything rested with him but it is at times such as these when the truly world-class players enter their own zones, in which focus and stillness are the only things that exist. Think of Cristiano Ronaldo and his last-gasp free-kick for Portugal against Spain in the opening round of group games.Kroos is known for his ice-cool temperament, his composure and his wonderful technique. He showcased them all in a moment that will go down in German football folklore. He had the presence of mind to open up the angle slightly but decisively by rolling the ball to Marco Reus and then having it presented back to him but, really, it was all about the execution.The whip and bend that Kroos summoned with his right foot was matched by the precision. The ball arced into the far, top corner and, in a flash, Germany was back in love with its world champions.Löw still has problems there are several areas where Germany have to improve. Having controlled the opening 10 minutes against Sweden, it was shocking to see how vulnerable they were to the counterattack for the remainder of the half.Defensively, there are holes spaces in behind, which are caused, in part, by Löw’s desire to have his full-backs pressed high. And this is before the form of the centre-half Jérôme Boateng is discussed. He was sent off in the 85th minute for a second bookable offence and his suspension for the final group tie against South Korea may not be a bad thing.Nobody is saying that Kroos’s Roy of the Rovers winner has papered over the cracks but, in psychological terms, its impact feels monumental. It has provided a touchstone, a point around which the team and, ideally, the country can rally. It has reinforced the squad’s belief while it also sends an ominous message to the rest of the World Cup field. Germany do not know when they are beaten. They fight until the last breath and they will come through.Moreover, there is nothing quite like the feeling when an all-or-nothing gamble comes off. Löw had rolled the dice after Boateng’s dismissal, taking off the left-back Jonas Hector and sending on the attacking midfielder Julian Brandt. He finished with two defenders and five out-and-out attackers. Fortune favoured Löw’s bravery and that, too, was fortifying.Reus described the elation of the victory as “pure ecstasy” but it was Sami Khedira, the under-fire midfielder whom Löw had dropped, who best summed it up. “Pheeeew,” Khedira tweeted. “So important! Now we’re in the tournament. Never write us off.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca5e7a828ebdc004dce9493a2dc7ab6162bf6675/0_150_3872_2323/master/3872.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d6dcaf121f3b22e49df71b3b65141af","title":"world cup team so far cristiano ronaldo","story":"Standing at 1.93 metres (6ft 4in) Beiranvand commands his box well while showing the reflexes and strong hands to make improbable saves, such as the one that denied Hakim Ziyech against Morocco or the double-stop from a Sergio Busquets shot against Spain.

His attacking potency does not come at the expense of defensive stability. Rating 7Herrera called the shots in the win over Germany. An all-rounder, he was the conduit of attacks thanks to his precise passing and also the leader in defence, making more tackles than anyone against the defending champions, combining the roles well by setting up the goal after hustling the ball from Sami Khedira. Rating 7An artful and industrious linchpin for Croatia, he deservedly rounded off the scoring during the dismantling of Argentina, having previously starred in the win over Nigeria. His determination, imagination and technique help make his side solid while enabling their attacks to flow. Rating 9The Watford player should not have featured against Portugal after being knocked out in a collision while playing at right-back during the narrow defeat to Iran. But he started, all the same, even throwing away his protective head wear as if it was holding him back, and showed his versatility – not to mention his strength and skill – by excelling in a more attacking role when moved further forward, tormenting the left‑back, Raphaël Guerreiro, from start to finish. Rating 7His precise and nimble scheming is perhaps Croatia’s greatest weapon, a key part of what makes them genuine contenders. His goal against Argentina, following a penalty in the win over Nigeria, was one of the best of the tournament so far. Rating 9A month after his 22nd birthday the elegant midfielder has been confirmed as a national treasure in Russia, his creative skills being instrumental to the hosts’ early surprise successes at this tournament. He has made things happen around him without ever being predictable and played at a level that suggests he will be moving on shortly from CSKA Moscow. Rating 8His hat-trick against Spain had an element of luck but, then again, is it really a coincidence that the normally flawless David de Gea made an uncharacteristic mistake while attempting to save a shot from Ronaldo? Or that Morocco’s usually tight defence disintegrated when Ronaldo ed in for the winning goal. He makes his own luck and, at 34, still sets the standard for all others. Rating 9"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5944a5f555203a8ddf6c2a07ad27c014a53f8cdc/0_23_3712_2227/master/3712.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6af61dcc56d8cfc8708edc8484397d48","title":"england v panama world cup 2018 live","story":"This is a good picture of celebrating Englishmen:Japan will shortly be playing Senegal, and you can follow the match either in English:Or - get this - in Japanese!Gareth Southgate has answered some questions:I really didn’t like the performance. Well, I didn’t like the start, and I didn’t like the goal at the end, but I guess the bits in the middle were pretty good. I think we were a little bit anxious at the beginning. We played some really good stuff after 35, 40 minutes. And second half is difficult. We talked about the importance of one more goal to be top of the group, which is why the goal at the end is disappointing. But it’s really rewarding to see how well they’re playing, and how much they’re enjoying their football. Really, really happy with the performance from the boys. To win 6-1 in the World Cup is fantastic. I’m delighted with that. I think we want to put on a good performance for the fans, but also for ourselves.We’re working on set pieces a lot, and to see it coming out in the games when we prepare so much for it. It’s such a big factor in games, we put in so much work and we’re glad that it keeps coming out on the pitch.It was very hot out there. Maybe they’re used to it more, but I think the confidence we had coming into the game showed, especially in the first half. It could have been a nearly perfect performance. It’s disappointing to concede, but takes nothing away from the performance we put in. It’s a squad game and everyone’s got to put in a performance, and I think everyone did that today.The togetherness I’ve seen is incredible. Off the pitch everybody mixes with each other. Everybody wants the ball, nobody shies away from the ball. We’ve got to keep on doing that, keep showing our confidence and keep playing the way we have. We’ve just got to keep our feet on the ground and keep working hard in training. This could be the start of something good.This is how the ranking of teams will be decided if they finish level on points in their group:5. The ranking of each team in each group shall be determined as follows: a) greatest number of points obtained in all group matches b) goal difference in all group matches c) greatest number of goals scored in all group matches. If two or more teams are equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings shall be determined as follows: d) greatest number of points obtained in the group matches between the teams concerned e) goal difference resulting from the group matches between the teams concerned f) greater number of goals scored in all group matches between the teams concerned g) greater number of points obtained in the fair play conduct of the teams based on yellow and red cards received in all group matches as follows:  – yellow card: minus 1 point  – indirect red card: minus 3 points (as a result of a second yellow card)  – direct red card: minus 4 points  – yellow card and direct red card: minus 5 points Only one of the above deductions shall be applied to a player in a single match h) drawing of lots by the Fifa Organising Committee. And John Stones as well:Not something I thought I’d do at the start of the day. It’s great to get through. I remember four years ago, knowing how hard the lads had worked. This time round, playing, we wanted to do the country proud and get through to the next step and see where we can go.I think to score my first goals for England, that was something special, especially at the World Cup. We defended so well and dominated the match, to not get a clean sheet was a bit disappointing. It’s something to take into the next game I suppose, and hopefully I can get a few more goals from set pieces.Peep peep! England have smashed their record for the biggest World Cup win. It was 3-0 it’s now 6-1. It could have been more, but they eased up in the second half after leading 5-0 at the break. Harry Kane scored England’s first World Cup hat-trick since 1986. I have to jump straight into cricket mode, but Simon Burnton will bring you all the post-match reaction. Thanks for your company, bye.90 min Four minutes of added time.89 min “Look at the link again about fair play separation,” says James Hurle. “England and Belgium start on 0 points and then earn minus points for each fair play contravention. Team with the highest score (least minuses) tops group.”Ah yes, my mistake. That’ll teach me to sneer at Fifa!88 min “Rob, very disappointed to see you use such incendiary language to describe the Panamanian football team,” says David. “There are plenty of English clubs that play an agricultural brand of football and have done for years on end, but words like ‘filthy’ are generally not used by journalists to describe them. Is it easier to use crass language (which unfortunately has a racial association) about a team we will never hear about again?”I use the word ‘filthy’ all the time to describe teams who boot people up in the air. I quite like this Panama team, and I’ve always guiltily enjoyed football filth. Sorry not to be a racist.87 min The match is petering out. The second half has been largely uneventful, aside from those two landmarks: Kane’s hat-trick and Panama’s first World Cup goal.84 min Both sets of fans are having a party: Panama because they have scored, England because IT’S ONLY BLOODY COMING HOME! Nothing is happening on the pitch.83 min Yes, fair play points will split England and Belgium if necessary, though the wording of this suggests the group winners would be the ones who collect the most yellow and red cards.82 min I think it was Rose and Maguire who played Boloy onside. Meanwhile, Sterling whistles a shot just wide from 20 yards. That was a fine effort.80 min That goal means England and Belgium are now dead level: F8 A2. So if they draw, I think they will be split on the Fair Play table.What a charming moment this is. Baloy, the 37-year-old substitute, runs on to Avila’s outswinging free-kick and stretches to slam a terrific half-volley past Pickford from 12 yards. It was poor defending from England, with some defenders pushing out and others playing everyone onside, but few would begrudge filthy, incompetent Panama such a joyous moment.Panama have scored their first World Cup goal!76 min Rose gives away a needless corner – and Roman Torres misses a great chance from it. The corner was flicked on beautifully at the near post and landed perfectly for Torres, who slammed it wide on the run from six yards. Panama are still gamely pursuing their first World Cup goal, despite the scoreline.74 min “Hi Rob,” says Lizz Poulter. “I love football (and can be a little naïve) so I really can’t bear the idea that a team (my team, in this case) would play for a draw or a loss. Apart from it being against the spirit of the game, isn’t it better for team morale to win wherever possible? As I said, I have been accused of being Pollyanna-ish and I do wear my heart on my sleeve, but come on - we can take Germany, Brazil or anyone on our day, let’s not be defeatist already.”I’m probably getting ahead of myself. Germany could still win their group, which would change everything. And you are right about the benefits to morale of beating Belgium, even in what is likely to be a reserve match. Also, the natural English tendency to worry about the future doesn’t really fit this intrepid team. Let them have a bit of fun and see where it takes them. 73 min A free-kick on the left leads to a game of head tennis, until eventually Henderson sizzles an acrobatic volley just wide from the edge of the area.72 min This game is drifting to sleep. Murillo is booked for a foul on Sterling.70 min England bring on Danny Rose for Kieran Trippier, who appears to have a slight knock. Ashley Young will move to right wing-back.69 min Panama make two changes: Barcenas and Gomez are replaced by Arroyo and Baloy. 66 min Panama almost get their first World Cup goal! The impressive Barcenas played a fine through pass to the marauding Murillo, whose attempted dink was well blocked by the hitherto unemployed Pickford.65 min “I note you’d rather England play Mexico further down the line,” says Rob Marriott. “Isn’t that a bit like the presumptuousness that did for England two years ago? Mexico have been magnificent.”They have, and that’s why last night I impetuously bought their kit to wear during five-a-side, but you’d still rather play them than Brazil or Germany.64 min A double change for England: Vardy and Delph replace Kane, the leading goalscorer at this tournament with five, and the superb Lingard.It was a fluke goal but he won’t care. Loftus-Cheek’s long-range shot hit the unsighted Kane and completely wrongfooted Penedo. VAR checked for offside but he was played onside by the heel of Torres.Harry Kane becomes the first England player since Gary Lineker to score a World Cup hat-trick!59 min Sterling and Loftus-Cheek have not had great games. Nor, in truth, has Kane, though that won’t be a problem if he scores twice every game. Lingard has been the only outstanding attacking player. What a funny game it has been.58 min “The mind boggles how Panama managed to get to this World Cup, unless the occasion has got to them and they’ve bottled it,” says Dave Tole. “But really, imagine being in their group and not finishing above this rabble?”57 min The second half has been a bit like a friendly, in stark contrast to the unfriendly before half-time.55 min “Hey Rob,” says Andy Morton, “how come neither you nor the BBC mentioning that one more goal and England ahead of Belgium on goal difference ? That could matter, no?”It’s a mediawide conspiracy to ensure goal difference doesn’t get too big-headed about its influence on the World Cup. But yes, you’re right. I actually think it would be better for England to finish below Belgium, because it could be the difference between playing Mexico or Switzerland in the quarter-finals rather than Brazil or Germany.54 min Loftus-Cheek wins a corner for England, who have already scored four from them in this tournament if you include Kane’s second penalty. Trippier’s outswinger is booted away by Torres.53 min There has been a notable drop in intensity from England, which is fair enough in this heat.52 min It’s just dawned on me that John Stones is on a World Cup hat-trick.51 min It’s been a slow, low-key start to the second half from both sides. Panama win their first corner of the game, which is flicked across goal and headed clear by Walker.48 min “You,” says ,” says Darcy Grimaldo Grigsby, “are so offensive.”Crikey. I love this job.47 min It’ll be interesting to see how England play the second half. The logical thing is to preserve energy, but they will never have another chance to win 10-0 in a World Cup game.46 min Peep peep! Panama begin the second half.“’Panama are filthy and incompetent,’” says Kevin O’Connor, quoting my half-time entry. “Let’s turn down our Trump-talk-O-meter shall we Rob.”What should I have said? ‘Panama are angelic and unlucky to be 5-0 down’?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff76d26d71b2615cc919a8c0c24cda2f3ffa58d8/292_634_3541_2124/master/3541.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce922595a6c62b37938a7c00f931a671","title":"japan v senegal world cup 2018 live","story":"If you’d like to follow this match through Japanese text commentary, then this will make you happy:Wolof commentary is not available the moment.

That should make Senegal even stronger in midfield, lessening the chance of Japan being able to conjure between the lines. But Badou Ndiaye drives forward well, too, so it’s not a negative move by Cissé.Senegal’s supposed weaknesses were not seen in the win against Poland, when the goalkeeper, Khadim Ndiaye, did not put a hand or foot wrong the 19-year-old full-back, Moussa Wagué, betrayed no sign of inexperience and Idrissa Gana Gueye overcame wan recent form to produce a solid performance. It would have been nice to see the Senegalese flash more of their creative skill but Keita Baldé stayed on the bench, along with Badou Ndiaye, and Sadio Mané played efficiently without sparkling. That was enough to beat Poland and will probably suffice against Japan. That’s my view, anyway. If you think otherwise, please feel free to explain yourself.

Thanks for joining us. We’ll be back tomorrow. Tom H emails in on that tiebreaker scenario. God forbid this happens, there will be panic, but Tom might just have cleaned up. “From our understanding: if two or more teams are level on points and have identical records, they are separated using fair play points and beyond that, the drawing of lots. If you look at the tie-breaker rules carefully, before the fair play comes into effect, there are the following three tests:1. Greatest number of points obtained in the group matches between the teams concerned2. Goal difference resulting from the group matches between the teams concerned3. Greater number of goals scored in all group matches between the teams concernedThat phrase “between the teams concerned’ is pretty important. What it says is to discount the results against teams NOT concerned. In this case, that’s South Korea. You end up with a table between the three teams (Germany, Sweden, Mexico), all with the same points and the same goal difference….. but in this scenario, Mexico will have scored one less goal against the “other teams concerned” than Sweden or Germany, meaning they will miss out on progression to the next round.However, if the results are at 2-1 instead of 1-0, then it will go to the fairplay situation. I could be wrong on this..... but that’s my read.”Niall Mullen emails in. “Has anyone thought of playing Rashford and Sterling? They are both more dangerous players than Lingard. Alternatively play all 3 with Sterling in the number 10 position. He was pretty good there the times he did it for Liverpool.”My recollection is of Sterling not being much cop in that position four years ago, which is not to say he can’t do it now but Southgate appears to favour twinned attacking midfielders rather than attackers. And isn’t Sterling’s role off the striker - Harry Kane - anyway? Our man Barney Ronay has made his predictions and he’s sticking to them. A question from Argha: “What happens in Group F if Germany beats S.Korea 1-0 and Sweden beat Mexico 1-0? Germany, Sweden and Mexico would then have identical points, goal difference,goals scored and goals conceded.”From our understanding: if two or more teams are level on points and have identical records, they are separated using fair play points and beyond that, the drawing of lots. The first scenario could be bad for Germany after Jerome Boateng’s mystery red card against Sweden while lots drawing bring back memories of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. TS Ahmad has emailed in: “Any news on the Argentinian coach’s status? I so want to hear he be sacked before the final game with Nigeria, though that won’t solve the quality midfield that Argentina lacks.” There is much talk of a rebellion in the ranks, with Lionel Messi leading the insurrection against Jorge Sampaoli, and wanting him sacked. However, this appears to have failed. Sacking the coach with a game still to play, and possibly the rest of the tournament would have franked any of the shenanigans that Spain served up on the eve of Russia 2018. And would have been great fun. But TS makes a great point who can make Enzo Perez a better player? And overnight? Argentina have the chance to be the France 2010 of this tournament and there may be time yet. Familiar problems being blamed for South Korea’s woes. After losing to Mexico on Saturday, and pointless, they must beat Germany to have a chance to make the last 16. Shin Tae-yong might as well be Gareth Southgate or a Scotland manager when saying this. We have systemic problems. We must think how we can improve our domestic league and work with young players. We lack experience and that doesn’t come overnight. Michael Cosgrove emails in. “No player gets to pull on an England shirt without having spent years working hard for it and, for some, being regularly forced to confront and overcome adversity in the form of injuries and a lack of games, and that’s why I’m extremely pleased to see Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s name on today’s team list. As Dominic Fifield’s piece reveals, the lad has had more than his fair share of challenges to overcome, including Mourhino’s lack of faith in him, so I hope he has a great game and goes on to become a regular fixture because if anyone deserves a break for once it’s him.”Michael makes a fair point, and one well made. Loftus-Cheek, like many from Chelsea’s farm of talent, has had a tough ride beyond winning the FA Youth Cup. When being asked about Loftus-Cheek in the build-up to Chelsea’s 2016-17 season (and how did that go?), Mourinho said this: “You need ten minutes. In ten minutes you can show me if you are ready or if you are not ready.”A tough school, and Loftus-Cheek’s ten minutes didn’t work out. He needed a couple of years and some rather more pastoral care. Let’s not forget today’s other games. At 4pm BST, we have Japan v Senegal, a match in which our minute-by-minute coverage comes in both English and Japanese, with, unless there’s been a huge mistake on the rota, Paul Doyle doing the former and Ben Mabley doing the latter. Ben’s MBM on Japan’s first game, their defeat of Colombia has been capturing some local attention in the Asahi Shimbun. Away from plucky England, to France, who are safely into the last 16 with performances that would probably have had UK TV’s Team GB-inspired tub-thumping, chest-beating punditry posse in raptures. The real truth, of course, is that France have been no good so far, and Paul Pogba is getting a bit doomy. It might be my last World Cup. I’m realistic, we don’t know if I’ll be called up, maybe other players will be better than me. I hope I’ll play more. I’ve already had the chance to play two, some can only dream to play one.Good morning, world. And thanks to Scott and Jonathan. Ok, then. This is the time, this is the hour, this is this. Or, actually, what should be an easy win for England or else the chumminess of Camp Repino will descend into rancour far worse than the contents of Steve Holland’s notebook caused.Anyway, that’s your lot from me.

They’re not happy with referee Felix Brych’s officiating during their dramatic 2-1 loss to Switzerland, and have accordingly whined to Fifa in the official style.We have submitted seven video recordings clearly showing Brych’s tendency to make decisions against our national team. The footage reveals Brych’s double standards in brandishing yellow cards, as he was quick to book our key players while he didn’t do the same in similar situations at the other end. The most glaring poor decision was not awarding Serbia a penalty for a foul on Aleksandar Mitrovic with the score 1-1, and awarding the spot kick could have turned the match our way. The whole world saw the penalty except Brych and it should have gone to VAR analysis. We are wondering why Serbia is the only team in the World Cup where the match official chose to ignore controversial situations at it raises the legitimate question whether the VAR is being used selectively.Two observations: (a) Where’s the dignity?

The Manchester City forward is aiming to score his first goal for his country since October 2015, 21 caps ago, as England seek to secure qualification from the section. Ashley Young has again been preferred to Danny Rose at left wing-back, while Loftus-Cheek will make his first World Cup start as Alli continues his rehabilitation from a thigh strain. The Spurs midfielder is hopeful of proving his fitness ahead of Thursday’s final group game against Belgium in Kaliningrad.Paul MacInnes processed Germany’s jaw-dropping feat of escapology last night with a mixture of awe and wonder. Here’s his take on the current state of the still-reigning world champions.There are many questions about this team that remain unanswered. In short, here are a few: the form of Jérôme Boateng, the positions occupied by their full-backs, the wild variations in tempo, the apparent lack of an effective number nine. But all of them seem less significant than the fact that Germany remain Germany and they’re still in the World Cup.Peru striker Jefferson Farfan has been hospitalised after a clash of heads with one of the squad’s goalkeepers in training. The Peruvian FA reports that initial results have been “favourable for the player” but he’ll remain in the hospital for monitoring. Peru are already out after losses to Denmark and France. They still have a match against Australia to come in Sochi.Wilson’s got his chalkboard out. A typically wonderful column, in which tactics guru Jonathan gets to the heart of the goalscoring problem blighting this World Cup.The pattern has been clear for at least three decades and is predictable and natural. The lack of time available to coaches mean that they, naturally, make a priority of defensive structures over attacking ones: while an under-drilled attack can always conjure a goal from nothing, an under-drilled defence will always concede. Besides, defensive principles are relatively universal much less adaptation is required than for attacks that can vary wildly.Football fans witnessed the spectacular Scarlet Sails festivities in St Petersburg last night. The tradition celebrates the end of the school year, as a ship with scarlet sails serenely glides towards the Winter Palace. Fans of Brazil, Costa Rica, Argentina and Nigeria lined the banks to enjoy the spectacle, which also included a firework display.I wonder what Lieutenant Commander Tommy Woodrooffe would have made of this?That’s All Right Then dept. And it’s more on world champions Germany cavorting with glee at the end of their dramatic win over Sweden. The Swedes weren’t too happy with the reaction on the German bench at the time, but in typically easy-going Scandinavian style, all is now forgiven. Yay! Sweden substitute Pontus Jansson lost his temper with the Germans, but has now calmed down: “Some of them celebrated in a disrespectful way. There was a lot of feelings, we had just let in a goal and lost the game, so it was pretty sour. Maybe there was unnecessary anger from me, but they apologised afterwards so it’s just a case of accepting it. There were a lot of feelings in the heat of the moment.”Just in case you missed the earlier breaking news ... in scenes that would put John le Carré to shame, our man in Russia, Dominic Fifield, has been peering through binoculars at scraps of paper in order to decode England’s line-up against Panama. And here’s what he’s found out!Raheem Sterling is to retain his place in the England lineup for this afternoon’s Group G game against Panama, with Gareth Southgate set to make a solitary change - Ruben Loftus-Cheek for the injured Dele Alli - for the matchin Nizhny Novgorod.While Steve Holland’s training notes, photographed at an open session on Thursday, had appeared to indicate Marcus Rashford might get the nod up front alongside Harry Kane, Sterling will partner the captain against the side ranked 55 in the world.

It wasn’t a bad dilemma to have, was it? Here’s Daniel Taylor on the cautious optimism in the England camp.BREAKING NEWS. Here’s how England will be lining up this afternoon against Panama, courtesy of our man Dominic Fifield.Raheem Sterling is to retain his place in the England lineup for this afternoon’s Group G game against Panama, with Gareth Southgate set to make a solitary change - Ruben Loftus-Cheek for the injured Dele Alli - for the matchin Nizhny Novgorod.While Steve Holland’s training notes, photographed at an open session on Thursday, had appeared to indicate Marcus Rashford might get the nod up front alongside Harry Kane, Sterling will partner the captain against the side ranked 55 in the world.

The Spurs midfielder is hopeful of proving his fitness ahead of Thursday’s final group game against Belgium in Kaliningrad.So, good old Germany, eh. But they’re not resting on their laurels. Despite that victory over the Swedes, they’re planning to make some more changes for their final must-win group game over South Korea. “My players were tired at the end of the game and Marco Reus had cramps as early as 10 minutes before the end,” says Joachim Loew. “Jerome Boateng is suspended and Sebastian Rudy broke his nose. We will need a couple of days to recover. Rudy could potentially play on Wednesday but we will need to wait and see. Mats Hummels is likely to play and if he does then we have another option in defence.” Thanks to Jonathan. Swedish fatalism, anyone?Speaking of that cuppa, I can hear the kettle boiling, which must mean Scott Murray is due any second now. As always, thank you for your company and engagement.

The Golden Shoe now usually refers to the top scorer in Europe across all club competitions.The Golden Boot goes to the player credited with the most goals (not including own goals, since you ask). If there is a tie, the award goes to the player with the most assists. If there is still a tie, the winner is the player who played the fewest minutes - that is to say, the player with most goals per minutes played. The second- and third-placed players are given the Silver and Bronze Boot respectively.In 2010, Thomas Müller, David Villa, Wesley Sneijder and Diego Forlán were tied on five goals. Müller won on the basis of assists, with the others ranked on the basis of minutes played. This meant that Forlán, in fourth place, got nothing, and had to console himself with the Golden Ball for the best player of the tournament.

She talks to Eva Wiseman about the ‘magic energy’ that drives her and how she’s finally learning to make sense of herselfThere was a time when the voice of Florence Welch was as inescapable as an ambulance siren. “You’ve got the love, youuuu…” It blasted from car windows, it shot over sporting montages, it echoed through Primark. And then, just as quickly, it was gone.Now 31, her hair less roaring fire, more gentle sunset, Florence Welch is a calmer woman than the whirling girl behind three number one albums who headlined Glastonbury in a silver suit. Today, removing her jewellery so as not to jangle over the tape recorder, she looks like the Lady of Shalott in blue jeans. It was during that everywhere period, when Welch could hear herself coming every time she stepped out of the house, that she started to crack, slightly.“That’s when the drinking and the partying exploded, as a way to hide from it. I was drunk a lot of the time, on extra dirty Martinis – my way of drinking three shots at once. I was never interested in,” and she laughs, bitterly, “a nice glass of wine.” She says the phrase as if it were an urban myth she had always enjoyed a party. It was in the toilets of a London nightclub that, in 2006, she auditioned in front of her now-manager, becoming Florence and the Machine and breaking America three years later. In that period she rarely slept. When she got home after a two-day party, she was always in trouble. She’d get a text, typically, “Where RU?” “And I’d be like, ‘I’m not quite sure, but I’m wearing someone else’s clothes…’ The partying was about me not wanting to deal with the fact my life had changed, not wanting to come down. It always felt like something had picked me up and thrown me around various rooms and houses, then gone ‘boom!’” She flings her arms out theatrically. “It happened every time, and every time it was shocking.”But still, the music came, these huge bloody songs about love and loss – the director Greta Gerwig described them to Welch as “the deepest, darkest well of pain, and then you just throw a big party in there and invite everybody”. It makes Gerwig cry, she admitted, uncontrollably. The sound took some time to shape – it wasn’t until she started making music with another young woman, Isa Summers, that they emerged with the single Dog Days Are Over, a huge Kate Bush-ian snarl of a pop song that came to define her. Until then she’d been working with older male producers. “And there was an unconscious deferral, a bias against myself that felt ingrained.” Four albums in, she’s still making music the same controlled, “feminine” way, the only difference being today she knows when to take things out. “When it’s too… Florencey?” I nod then stop, for fear of seeming rude.As she approached the 10th anniversary of this career that became very big very fast, she decided to sober up. “When I realised I could perform without the booze it was a revelation. There’s discomfort and rage, and the moment when they meet is when you break open. You’re free.”On stage, she says, she always felt absolved – nobody was angry with her up there. It was her offstage life that she had to work on. Up there she will climb the scaffolding, holding on with one hand, leaping into the crowd and ripping her top off when she gets too sweaty. After those nights it’s quite hard for her to return to earth. Everything, she explains, starts to take on a magical significance. There will be moments – sitting in a friend’s room watching TV, for instance – when, sleep-deprived and sober, she will be suddenly awed. “Mundane moments become incredibly profound. The performing, the transcendence, then sitting watching TV – all can coexist, and the mundane makes the magical. Maybe I’m trying to hold on to normalcy. Maybe because being onstage has become normal, the pockets of peace seem really wild. But I treasure them.”So she stopped drinking and she started staying in, and last night she watched the entire new series of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. “I think I reached the bottom of Netflix.” And though her life is quieter, her work has become louder. “Before, I thought I ran on a chaos engine, but the more peaceful I am, the more I can give to the work. I can address things I wasn’t capable of doing before.”Florence likes to trick herself. She does it with a blue pen, writing what she calls little “self dares of truth”, reassuring herself that she won’t show them to anyone. “Shh, it’s OK, it’s just us…” And it was as one of these that Hunger, the first single from her new album, High As Hope, began. The first line is: ‘At 17, I started to starve myself.’ “It’s the first time I’ve been able to put it on paper,” she whispers. ‘I thought that love was in the drugs,’ the song continues, ‘but the more I took, the more it took away. And I could never get enough. I thought that love was on the stage. You give yourself to strangers, you don’t have to be afraid.’ “But now I’ve realised that that nugget of insecurity and loneliness is a human experience. The big issues are there however you address them.” She giggles suddenly. “The weirdest thing is, that as personal as it feels, as soon as you say it, other people say: ‘I feel like that, too.’”She was terrified, talking about her eating disorder for the first time. Not just talking – singing. Her sister was baffled. “Like, ‘You couldn’t admit this for years, and now you put it in a pop song?’” But the terror meant, Florence says, that she needed to do it.Terror drives her, or pushes her forward, a sharp pitchfork in her back. She was an imaginative child, but imaginative in a way that sounds oppressive, confusing – she believed that ghosts and werewolves were real. Still wonders. “I learned ways to manage that terror – drink, drugs, controlling food. It was like a renaissance of childhood, a toddler’s self-destruction let loose in a person with grown-up impulses.”Recently, she was staying at the Chateau Marmont in LA, and woke with a start to find a white dress hanging above her head. “Then suddenly I was in the bathroom, screaming. Was it sleep paralysis? I don’t know how I got to the bathroom.” It’s only recently she overcame her fear of the dark, but she says this with no embarrassment. In the lead-up to the release of Hunger, in May, she says: “I was a nightmare – I cried all the way through Avengers: Infinity War.”Did something happen when she was 17, to trigger that descent? She pauses for a very long time. Her coffee goes cold. Outside, seasons change. Apologetically, she looks away. “I know how to deal with it in a song, but a lot of stuff I’m… still figuring out? I can say things in a song I don’t understand yet, like: ‘I thought love was a kind of emptiness’ – that feels important. You think love is unreachable, empty, hungry, then there’s a kind of sadness when something more stable comes towards you. You don’t recognise it as love because it’s not desperate enough. And I’ve never tied the two together until now.”Is she through that now? Is she eating? She takes a deep breath. “I’m further away from it than I ever have been. It was something I experienced and I’m 31 now and at a time where I can perhaps… see what I was looking for?” Her speech is lilting, soft south London, and punctuated liberally with ellipses.On Florence’s 30th birthday her sister had a baby, and the benefit of her new quiet life is that she’s been able to be there for her niece’s first year. “We help each other through. I’ve done career, she’s done family, and we’ve both seen behind the perfection. I’d love to be married, but I can see the good and bad in each life. I’ve wondered sometimes: ‘Did I dream too big, do I have to let it go?’” Going on tour, she’s realised, she goes into a state of stasis, popping out years later to find that not only have all her friends had kids and got married, but grown up in even grander, less definable ways, learning things like how to break up well – something she is yet to master – and how to feel “deserving of love”.Though her father, Nick, an ex-ad executive, left London to open campsites, she lives close to both her sister and her mother, Evelyn, a professor of renaissance studies when Florence talks about her, she nods slowly as if contemplating a difficult Sudoku.“My mum was so worried about me doing music – she thought it was dangerous, could hurt me, could be fleeting. She’s accepted it’s not a phase now. But she’s been through a lot, so always prepares for the worst.” Her mother mourns the fact Florence didn’t go to university. Once, she told her she could remember every outfit she’d ever worn, and her mother said: “What a waste of a brain.”But, as Florence navigates this quiet life, their similarities are becoming more clear to her. Watching Evelyn lecture about a pair of renaissance gloves she saw, suddenly, where her performance gene came from. “And people tell me I disappear – that’s like her, too, and it can be isolating in a relationship, and maybe was isolating when we were kids. Like me, I think she has big feelings, but she’s put them somewhere else, away. I’m still figuring out what that well of longing in me is, and looking at the origins.” Then there is another pause, so deep you could swim in it. “My mother’s mother committed suicide. And the way she was loved by her mother has related to the way she loves us, which then is the way we love others. My grandmother fell, so sometimes I feel like we’re all still in this loop, falling with her. The trickle-down of tragedies.”It’s only recently that she started talking about this with her mother, and those dog days after she was 17, and the way her relationships have followed the patterns drawn in childhood when she was an “octopus of feelings”, always hungry for attention from unavailable people.Her first book of poetry, Useless Magic, an elegant collaged scrapbook, is dedicated to her parents. The first words, written in Biro, are: “I make songs to tie people to me.” It’s in the same pen that she writes daily “sermons”, as she calls them, and she uses them to acknowledge and find the humour in the strangeness of her pop star life. For instance, she wants a record of having been drunk in a corridor with Liza Minnelli, and a record too that she knew this should never be mistaken for a normal afternoon.These undrinking days she still enjoys parties, but uses them to dance rather than get high – if someone starts making small talk with her and there’s music playing she will literally spin away towards the speakers.After we meet, having had a conversation that veered from recurring dreams she had as a child to a new Tinder bio (“Deeply domestic but also high stress, with no middle ground – hugely exposed but deeply hermity. Too many candles burning in my house to be safe”) she emails over a selection of these daily sermons. They’re scrappy and funny, and one ends: “I would also like a thousand texts that say ‘I love you,’ my phone buzzing endlessly, until I am exhausted, and empty. Oh shit.”For somebody whose career balances on drama and the guttural expression of heartbreak, she seems remarkably peaceful, almost happy. But sometimes, while she is in her tour bus on the way home to London, the maggot of an idea will burrow into her mind and she will think: “Wouldn’t it be a relief to go partying now? What if… what if you just fucked it all up? What if you drove all this into the ground?” She shakes her head suddenly like there’s water in her ear. “It’s still there. This, ‘What if I could take a day off, a break from this magical energy?’ But,” she grins, “it passes.”High As Hope is out now. Useless Magic is out on 5 July, £20, Penguin Books.

It isn’t the process of getting pregnant, with its cycles of raised and dashed hopes, or the term “sperm donor”, with its unsettling connotations. It’s not even the queasy feeling that what you are doing sets you apart from other people and that the reason you are doing it is not that you are a powerful, rational, resourceful woman, but, as a friend of mine put it after considering and rejecting the idea of having a baby alone, that “I couldn’t get anyone to shag me”.No. The hardest thing about having a baby alone is making the decision to do it.“So are you going to do it then?” says Rosemary. It is late summer 2013 and we are drinking whisky in a hotel bar in Edinburgh. “Yeah, probably,” I say. “I mean, I might. Are you?”I haven’t seen Rosemary for months and it is only after a lot of whisky, and with a casualness that belies the cold terror underneath, that we reach the main order of business: our ongoing discussion, part lament, part spur to action, over what to do about having children. That is: if, when, how and with whom, or, since we are both, for the purposes of this conversation, single, “with” “whom”.I have always known I wanted children. From the time I was old enough to conceptualise my future, motherhood made sense to me. It was always one child in my imaginings and never part of a fantasy about marriage, and while everything else in my life changed over the years – the country I lived in, the kind of work I did, the gender of the people I dated – the distant outline of a child remained steadfast. On the rare occasions I allowed myself to inspect it directly, the idea that it might never happen made me feel giddy with loss.I met L two years after moving to New York. On the surface of things, we looked very different – me, English, lefty, fundamentally unkempt she, New Yorker, centre-right, well put together. On any given day we could disagree about everything – fact or fiction, subway or car, Republican or Democrat – so that, in the months after we met, it felt like being on safari in each other’s alien worlds. If falling in love is, partly, a question of finding a docking station for one’s neuroses, I knew I was home when L told me that, after her building was evacuated during 911, she went straight to an off-licence and bought hundreds of dollars’ worth of booze in case civilisation collapsed and the world reverted to a barter economy. Come the zombie apocalypse, this is a woman you want on your side. But there was this, too: the house she grew up in would one day have to be sold, she said, and what she would miss most were the things you can’t take with you, like the sound the stairs made when they expanded at night. Somewhere in my system, a pilot light flared.She was three years older than me and told me from the outset that, in the near future, she was planning on trying to get pregnant. Logistically, this made sense it would be madness to forestall while we flapped about for another two years trying to decide what we were doing. Emotionally, however, it stumped me. According to every relationship model I knew, you could either be with someone who’d had kids before you met, have kids together and separate down the line, or split up and have a baby alone. There was no such thing as being with someone who had a baby on her own. It sounded like a terrible deal: all the stress and anxiety without the substance of motherhood.At that stage, the strongest terms in which I could have put my own long-held but dormant desire for a baby were that I didn’t want not to have one. If there was, behind this impulse, a larger, less tangible longing, I didn’t want to look into it too deeply lest it unleash a full-blown baby hunger I couldn’t get back in the box. But I started to notice small, unsettling changes in myself. When somebody asked me, “Do you have children?” – a question that, until recently, I had responded to in my head with versions of, “Are you mental? I’m about 11” – it started to sound less neutral, more unfriendly. I had always believed that, medical issues aside, most women without children had acted through choice, but my faith in this weakened. I watched as a number of friends missed out on having children because their boyfriends broke up with them when they were in the vicinity of 40, before having children with younger women. I watched as women six, seven years my senior finally met someone new and went through round after punishing round of IVF. I didn’t want to be alone at 45, or 50, and on Tinder, dating people with children when I had none of my own. I didn’t want to be 70, the age my mother was when she died, lying on my deathbed without the image of my child’s face in my head. Above all, I didn’t want to look back on this period and wish I’d had the courage to act.I also didn’t want to “help” another woman raise her baby. Unless I was Mother Teresa (I’m not), the only way it would make sense for me to stick around in the event of L having a child was if our relationship became a more conventional union, or if I had my own baby independently, too.It’s not that L’s pregnancy made me more broody (I defy any woman to see another woman’s early pregnancy up close and think, “Hey, that looks fun!”) and I wasn’t bound by her decisions. We didn’t live together. In fact, an infantile strand of my personality deliberately wanted to make different decisions. If we were going to suffer the deprivations of single parenthood, we might as well realise all the advantages, too – in my case, starting from scratch and doing precisely what suited me and my notional baby.All I had to do was figure out what that was. Would I use a friend as a sperm donor, or a stranger? If the former, who? If the latter, how would I make that choice? Would I move back to London for free treatment on the NHS (which, to the horror of the rightwing press, now offers fertility services to single women and lesbians) or stay in America and spend thousands on something that might not even work? In the event, I choose the path of least resistance: America will never really feel like home, but it is where I live, where L has her baby and where, eight months later, I am sufficiently panicked to finally get moving with my own.One of the things you have to get used to when you are a British person embarking on fertility treatment in the US is the pace. In Britain, the law of supply and demand is such that there are more women wanting sperm than there are donors, so even private clinics have waiting lists. In America, where no one with adequate resources waits for anything, you have a chat with your doctor, schedule a date, call the donor bank, which bikes the sperm round to the clinic, and off you go. You might have spent six months or six years deciding to do this but you could, potentially, be pregnant within a month of first seeing your doctor.That is, if you have made what feels at the time like the hardest decision: how to pick a donor. This question probably cost me six months of concentrated flapping, during which time I asked a male friend if he’d do it, because it seemed more “normal” than the alternatives, and was achingly relieved when he said no, before eventually deciding to find an anonymous donor.This is a tricky part of the story for me. There may come a day when it is as regular as milk to share details of one’s sperm donor – when there is a language less alienating to describe it than this, and that feels less compromising of one’s child’s privacy. But we are not there yet, and I’ve no idea how to calibrate this choice. Is it the biggest of my life, or essentially meaningless? Underplay the donor and you risk turning the guy into the elephant in the room go on about him too much and you risk pathologising your child’s background. Scrolling through profiles, I look for characteristics that align with my own. I want someone clever, which here means educated. I want someone with dark hair. I want someone whose favourite film isn’t Once Upon A Time In America or Titanic. In the absence of a metric for gauging a man’s humour or internal beauty or moral worth, I want someone tall and basically symmetrical. A choice is superficial only if it is made at the expense of deeper considerations and so, although I reject sperm donors on criteria that would outrage me if applied in real life by men to women, I tell myself I’m not doing anything wrong.Everything is extra: $35 for the guy’s baby photos $50 for an audio file. Guidelines vary, but in New York you can see photos of him only as a child. Some donor banks offer a “silhouette” of him as an adult, which would be hilarious if it weren’t so creepy. What next – his breath in a jar to rule out halitosis? I don’t listen to the audio files. I don’t try to find the guy, even though there is so much information, it would probably take me less than a day. This is not gene selection it is the selection of the story of how my child came to be, and, through a combination of vital statistics, familiarity of background, a subtle implication that he is a Democrat and his use of the word “tremendous”, which signals to me a certain wryness and enthusiasm, I make my choice. In other words, on nothing substantive. What matters is it’s my choice and I make it.I pay extra for ID disclosure, enabling any child to trace the donor when they turn 18. I decide how much to buy – enough for three cycles – then fill in a form and return it, along with payment for almost $2,000. When I call to confirm my request, I half expect the receptionist to laugh and ask what on earth am I doing, trying to buy genetic material over the phone as if it were lunch? Instead, after I mumble, “Need to order some sperm”, she puts me through to the lab, where a technician will check to see if what I want is available.I give him the donor number. There is a clacking of keys, followed by a short pause. Then, with the smoothness of a sommelier fielding a wine order at dinner, he says, “An excellent choice.”After weeks of monitoring, at the end of 2013, my eggs are ready. This is it, says Dr B. I can come in tomorrow and, after waiting an hour for the sperm to defrost, finally get this show on the road. He asks if I’d like L to be present when the insemination takes place. “Some people find it nice to involve their partners.”Fertility treatment can be hard and excluding, he says, and involving the patient’s partner, even to the extent of inviting him or her to operate the syringe full of sperm, can give them a feeling of inclusion. I blush. Clearly he’s in favour of L being present, either because it gives him a warm feeling or to neutralise some latent ambivalence he has about helping to create single mothers.I try to imagine the scene: me, stressed out and half-naked on a gurney L, holding the catheter and rolling her eyes the medical staff, trying not to intrude on our beautiful moment. I don’t think I want L there – I don’t want anyone there, it’s embarrassing – and when I imagine asking her, I realise I don’t want to give her an opportunity to say no, either.There is a cold, mean streak in me that makes me think trying to involve the partner is ludicrous under any circumstances. Surely there’s a dignity in allowing things to be what they are? This is a medical procedure pretending otherwise risks making the treatment seem sadder, just as choosing a sperm donor will continue to feel sad, or bad, or weird, as long as it’s tied to conventions associated with choosing a spouse.The next day, a week before Christmas, Dr B breezes in full of good cheer. We chit-chat as he loads the syringe with a substance that is, gram for gram, more expensive than the world’s finest heroin (though less expensive than marrying someone you’re not into in order to have a baby).The cycle fails, as do the subsequent three cycles, one of which results in a short-lived pregnancy and all of which mean that, by the spring of 2014, I am taking, for the second month in a row and despite producing too many eggs the first time, large amounts of fertility hormones.It is different this time.“How do you feel?” says Dr B.For five days I have been injecting myself with a preloaded pen, which has bruised me terribly. The skin of my abdomen looks like 1970s wallpaper, all bright purple flowers with a greeny blue border. I feel altered, hideously bad-tempered. I tell myself it’s chemical and will pass. But it doesn’t. A week after finishing the injections, Dr B looks at my charts and tells me to stop taking the drugs. Ten days later I go in for insemination number five.“Whoa,” says the nurse doing the ultrasound. “You’ve a lot going on in there.”I look at the screen: a lot of shapeless dark patches connected by strings.“They look like spider’s eggs,” I say, and shudder.I have, once again, overreacted to the hormones. But Dr B says not to worry: not all of them are mature. I could call off the cycle but I say, “Go ahead.” The sun comes out that weekend, and L and I take a walk with the baby in the buggy. I feel Zen in the face of all possible outcomes. On Monday night I go into my kitchen and crack an egg against the side of a pan for dinner. Two bright yellow yolks slide down. I have never seen such a thing before and stare down at the eggs, feeling bad for the hen. I am so surprised I say it out loud: “Twins.”It’s twins. Of course it is. How could it not be? I am a walking exemplar of the phrase, “Be careful what you wish for.” Over the next few weeks I wait for the idea of carrying twins to normalise, but it doesn’t. For minutes at a time I forget I’m pregnant, then I remember with the force of the original shock. I have lunch with an old friend I haven’t seen for a while. I know he’ll be shocked, too, and he is.“How’s that going to work?” he says.And there it is, the question we’ve been avoiding since L’s pregnancy. If I have these babies, what will the babies be to L and what will she be to them? The answer is only partly to be found in the relationship I have with her baby. There is no honorific to describe what I am to him and there is no word for what he is to me. He is at the centre of us, the miracle over whom we both marvel, but I have no moral, financial or legal responsibility for him. Neither do I perform many of the most basic parental duties. I have always known this lopsided arrangement would be tolerable only until I had a baby of my own. What I hadn’t anticipated is the ways in which its limitations would also prove to be strengths. In the year since his birth, my relationship with the baby has evolved to be oddly free-floating from that with L. He is my buddy, a child in whom I have no stake other than love. That it’s a love I’m not bound – by law or biology – to feel makes it all the more precious.On the other hand, what am I doing potentially bringing two further children into a situation it takes so long to explain? I can just about rationalise to myself why a woman without a child might want to maintain a degree of separation from a partner with a child, given the vast difference in lifestyle. But two women in separate households with babies of a similar age who hang out on evenings and weekends? If we’re not a blended family, then what on earth are we? Clearly, at this point, the proper course of action would be to either give up this nonsense of separate households and separate children, and move in together, or else call it a day. There is no middle way. Perhaps it is selfish. It’s selfish to carry on along parallel tracks, denying the children a second parent and creating two single-parent families. It’s selfish, practically, morally, financially and environmentally, to maintain our independence while being together, like driving two cars to a single destination. And while my relationship with L’s baby is full of joy, how can it survive once I have my own children and am unable to travel back and forth to see him?For the first time I seriously question why I want to do this alone. It isn’t just that L and I have conflicting ideas about parenting – very broadly, I am too mean in her eyes, and she isn’t mean enough in mine – it’s the historical weight each of us puts on those differences and our assumptions about where they might lead us. We both have a highly developed sense of self-preservation, which expresses itself in different ways, except, perhaps, in this one shared belief: that the way one protects children from harm is by controlling who has access to them. The only thing more frightening to me than not having a baby is having a baby in a hostile environment. One afternoon L sends me an email with a link to an apartment listing that is almost double the rent I pay in Brooklyn. The floor plan looks familiar, as does the view from the window. It’s in her building, the mirror image of her home, but one floor down.“?!” I reply.“But do we want to live that close to each other? Isn’t it weird?”I go to see it. The landlord is putting in new flooring and a new bathroom and most of the apartment is under polythene, but because it’s an exact copy of L’s, bar the fixtures and fittings, I don’t have much trouble imagining it. It occurs to me, as I walk around, that he may not even want to rent to a single woman expecting two babies. But in any case, it’s too expensive. Eeven if it’s the kind of building I need, with a mail room and an elevator and a maintenance team on site even if it would be amazing to have L upstairs when I bring the babies home even if the very fact that the listing came up in the first place, in a co-op that discourages rentals, is the kind of coincidence that feels like a gift from above – none of that matters, because I can’t afford it.It is, surely, nuts: to sort of live together but not. It feels like cheating, to have L’s support and proximity without the hard work of cohabitation. How would we explain it to the children? Or to ourselves? That we like each other sufficiently to be in daily contact, except on days when we don’t? What would the kids even be to each other? Cousins? Best friends? The victims of a half-arsed piece of emotional evasion, or beneficiaries of a radical new vision?In those first weeks after moving, we enter a honeymoon period in which the loveliness of living almost together is nothing to the luxury of living sort of apart. The act of leaving my flat and walking up one flight imbues daily visits with the tiny frisson of occasion. When one of us snaps, the other goes home without it being construed as a histrionic gesture. There’s no marriage or joint mortgage, but a commitment has been made. I have the long-overdue realisation that relationships rely on a balance between independence and the right level of curtailment of freedom to liberate one from the burden of choice.One evening, L sits on the sofa with her son, reading a book about different kinds of families. “‘Some people have two mommies,’” she reads, pointing to an illustration of two badgers wearing earrings with a baby badger in their midst. “‘Some people have two daddies. Some people have one mummy, hasome people have one daddy.’” Her baby, who isn’t a baby any more but a toddler and the most delightful child in the world, isn’t quite old enough to formulate questions and we are off the hook for a little while yet. L and I exchange glances. “Some people have a neighbour,” she says, sotto voce.My final ultrasound of the year falls just after Christmas. I am six weeks from the due date. The technician looks at the screen. He frowns, says something I don’t catch and leaves the room. Someone else comes in. Everyone gathers by the monitor while I look at the ceiling and try to figure out what to have for lunch. A fourth doctor comes in and tells me to get dressed and follow him. I feel a spike of alarm. In his office, my high-risk obstetrician, Dr Y, is waiting.“They have to come out,” Dr Y says.“Oh my God.”The placenta for the smallest baby is working only intermittently if it stops altogether, she’ll die.“This is not an emergency,” Dr Y says calmly, “but it is… fairly urgent.” He tells me he has time the following day, New Year’s Eve, or the day after that.“Let’s do it tomorrow,” I say, trembling.My dad is in London and offers to come straight to New York, but I don’t want him in the air while I’m having surgery I can’t add fear of his plane going down to everything else. At L’s that night, I tell her to ask her mother to come across town the following day to watch her son.“I’m so happy you’ll be there,” I say.“It’s only because everyone else is in England.”“No, it isn’t. I would want you to be there, whatever.”As I say this, I realise it’s true. Fear pushes me inward, joy pushes me out, and while I am as frightened of having these babies as of anything, it’s a different kind of fear: not a shrinking but an opening out. I have been so stringent in ensuring I can do this alone, perhaps the reward is that I don’t always have to.Right up until the last moment, a small part of me thinks, what if all this is a mistake? What if Dr Y turns to me and says there’s nothing in there – of course you’re not pregnant! Did you think that, by signing a few forms and handing over your credit card, you could dodge millennia of evolution, not to mention convention and common decency? Go home, buy yourself a cat and never speak of this again.But at 4.17 pm the next day, a tiny, fierce cry fills the room. Baby A is removed from the basement of my body. I burst into tears. L grips my hand. A moment later, Baby B comes out and L leaps from her seat in the direction of the babies while Dr Y, turning to his students, holds a quick pop quiz over my guts. Then the nurses bring over the babies.L gets all of this illegally on camera. It’s not footage I can watch too often. The babies, two flat-faced Glo Worms covered in gel, are blotchy and impossibly alive. I am insane on the gurney, grinning drunkenly at my two girls. Over and over I say it, in the manner of a woman shortly to be given more drugs: “Oh my God, I can’t believe they’re both blond.”• This is an edited extract from An Excellent Choice by Emma Brockes, published by Faber \u0026amp Faber at £16.99.

But millions of people don’t have bank accounts. Will they be cut out of this new economy?A strange thing happened to me recently. I was in a bar, but I couldn’t buy a beer. Or, to be exact, I refused to. I was in Öl at Hatch, a shipping container complex of food and drink purveyors on Oxford Road in Manchester, where the bar – to my surprise – was card-only. No cash. They had no way of taking my £10 note. It was stalemate. I had cards on me. But, in instinctive solidarity with the unbanked, those paid in cash or those who, like me (for years, a permanently skint freelancer), still budget in cash, I stood firm (and thirsty), irritated that any business would dictate how its customers pay.I sat down to eat a curry I had bought (with old-fashioned cash) from another Hatch unit. Then, an Öl barman brought over a conciliatory glass of beer, on the house. I told him the bar’s cash-free policy is elitist who wants to be forced to put a pint on a credit card? He talked about time saved and how not having cash on the premises was safer for the staff. We politely agreed to disagree.But where does this leave people without bank accounts (nearly 2 million people, according to the Financial Inclusion Commission), or those with poor credit histories who have to pay fees to use prepaid debit cards? Removing the cash option penalises them.“We’re aware of the community issues,” says McCall. He says that Takk gives free coffee to homeless people sleeping rough – those at the sharp edge of this cashless evolution. “But when we’re picked up on the fact we could be excluding people, we have to say that’s a story for banks and government. Scandinavia is largely cashless, and there businesses and governments are having that debate.”It is a debate that Britain may soon be having, too, as a wave of card-only food and drink venues hit UK high streets. With the exception of London’s bus network (cashless since 2014 south London’s trams follow suit in July), cash-free everyday businesses have previously been experimental one-offs. But now if you want a wrap at the Athenian in Bristol, a salad at the London chain Tossed or a coffee at Habitat cafe in Aberfeldy, Perthshire (after its local bank branch closed, Habitat’s owners were facing a 60-mile round trip to the bank) you will need to pay by card.Card-only bill settlement is faster for diners, makes it easier to split bills and is cost-effective (no safe, no bank charges, fewer accounting errors, no cashing-up). If Killer Tomato took cash, says Paice: “On a busy night, I might have two staff counting and reconciling the float with the receipts. I’d be paying senior staff to count coins.”What is clear, however, is that the new card-payment processors, such as SumUp and iZettle, make going cashless far more attractive. The established “merchant services” providers (which hire out card readers on long contracts and charge a variety of fees on different card transactions), are, says Paice, “complicated and deliberately opaque. It’s impossible to know what you’re going to be charged.”In contrast, the new players in the “fintech” sector levy a set percentage for each transaction. No contract. No expensive card readers. “iZettle has transformed payment-processing,” says McCall, who adds that it costs a tenth of his old provider’s service.The infrastructure is there for cashless, says Paice, as is the customer enthusiasm. Very occasionally, he has to turn someone away, but he adds: “In two years, I have had four angry customers – and I’m guessing the ones who get really angry are people operating in cash because they’re fiddling their taxes. They give me this phoney outrage about how I’m discriminating against the poor or old people. It’s cobblers. Flat-broke people are not eating in restaurants and everyone in London has a bank card: 12-year-olds, 90-year-olds. What they really mean is: ‘I don’t want to declare my income.’”“The haptic, physical sensation of handling and spending a £20 note makes you ‘feel it’. With cashless, that is lost somewhat,” says Jez Groom from Cowry Consulting, which researches “behavioural economics”. “The Apple Pay ding you get from your iPhone should be replaced with a vibration calibrated to the amount spent: light for under £10 heavy and consistent for £30.”For these reasons and more, David Fox, owner of the East Street and Tampopo restaurants in London and Manchester, has no intention of going cashless. But, given Britain’s direction of travel (“no institution is defending cash”), he can already see a future gap in the market for a restaurant aimed at people who crave the authenticity of notes and coins. “Like buying vinyl,” he asks, only half-joking, “will there be a generation who still enjoy the interaction of cash?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc60816820ef3fdf97b5680ef738f68788005097/0_154_3632_2179/master/3632.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2169af9611cc1c354c8784d9f8e574f6","title":"how i learned to love the three generation holiday","story":"A week away with children and grandparents has all the ingredients for a nightmare. Here’s how to make it a triumph…“How was the trip to Center Parcs with three generations of your partner’s family?” friends are asking politely. And to them I reply: “I’m still processing.” Here is what I learned:The trick to spending time with children is to give up all pretence of adult life and descend willingly into a world where those over eight are simply used as security and for collecting snacks. And you must go willingly, you must make the choice, first to enter the compound, with its fattened ducks and eerie silence after 9pm, and then to submit fully to a week without saying no. There is a playground round every corner, there’s an entertainer at breakfast time – all meals come with crayons and some taste of them, too. In every restaurant there is a soft-play area, an idea that I urge all businesses to roll out, immediately – it means the children are not tied to their adults through the means of iPads and threats, instead popping over for their chips, then back again to their cousins to continue the construction of an elaborate structure made out of shoes. Which gives the grown-ups time to continue their new favourite game: “Here’s what I’m going to say in an email to the management about how to improve Center Parcs.” Who knew we were such geniuses of town planning and tourism? By the end of each day, we had designed our own far superior versions (my particular irritation was with the add-on prices for each activity, though we did enjoy holding a very large owl) and could rest in the knowledge that, like Westworld or Westfield, we could fix this heaven experiment over the course of an afternoon.There are a handful of places in the UK where I am acutely aware that I’m Jewish, and this is one of them. This despite a colleague, having asked which Parc we were going to, smiling knowingly: “Ah, of course, the one for the liberal metropolitan elite.” Although the first time I visited Center Parcs, with my family and grandma when I was 10, we were perhaps the first chalet to host a full seder night, today we wear it lightly, I think, our Ashkenazi heritage, the only signs being the quantity of food my mother-in-law brought to barbecue and our bafflement at the boating lake. And yet I walked through this English land of burnt skin and badminton with a certain unplaceable anxiety. Perhaps everybody feels different here, a little apart from all the other guests with their artful manipulation of inflatables. It wasn’t until we were driving out into Bedfordshire, the barrier closing behind us, that it occurred to me we could have left at any time.Walking through a high street that’s been plonked in an ancient forest makes you feel dirty, these proud old trees dwarfed by a bustling Café Rouge. The idea was that these parks would be “an effective way for city folk to experience the countryside”. But we experience it with such sad apology that it makes you consider, not the beauty and grandeur of nature, but our too-human impulse to knock it down.I was awed by the 3G (three-generation) holiday, by the complete selflessness of my father-in-law choosing to spend his 70th birthday not at, say, a small Michelin-starred restaurant somewhere near the river, or in a comfortable living room surrounded by his many friends and a number of smoked salmon canapés, but instead with his kids and his kids’ kids, and those kids’ mothers, wiping ice cream off white T-shirts with a slightly dampened napkin. He made sandcastles in blazing heat, he detoured on foot to a supermarket to buy plasters with cartoon characters on them, he brought his own Nespresso machine, just in case.You can call anything a swimming pool if you put water in it. I learned this fairly quickly, as soon as we entered the subtropical swimming paradise and jostled our way into the tepid bubbles. It is a disconcerting feeling when both air and water are the temperature of urine, especially when surrounded by young children. They quickly ide into the too-scared and the too-fearless, the latter leaping off plastic rocks and bombing down slides as if on a stag night, the former clinging to their mothers so hard they bruise their tattoos. Every half hour, a Tarzan call echoes through the dome, signalling the start of the wave machine, and everyone comes scuttering from their games to pile into the pool, where babies float with enthusiastic yet slightly detached expressions, like the Queen seeing cows. Standing in these waves feels like being on a plane going down, with all the screaming and spillage that entails. The subtropical swimming paradise has a Starbucks and its own weather system and a queue for the flumes, and it was while waiting for my family to navigate all this that I read a Mumsnet thread about someone’s Darling Husband returning home from the Longleat park a little bit miffed because he was sure she’d told him that “going to Center Parcs” was a euphemism for anal sex.Some people hung knicker-bunting outside the Conservative MP Christopher Chope’s office after he blocked the recent bill to ban ‘upskirting’. It was the perfect (and perfectly British) response, and should be taken on in the future for all shows of contemptuous protest.Julia Davis and Vicki Pepperdine’s podcast, Dear Joan and Jericha, makes me absolutely hoot. Their advice to listeners with sexual problems is unsurpassable, and I particularly enjoyed the sensitive discussion about how Joan plans to explode her mother."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bf17566be5bb32867061bc829c974525ca083f2/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d70373e6f60eaf06775726d580409dcb","title":"i couldnt bring myself to read my parents love letters for years","story":"Before her mother died, she handed over a shopping bag of private and personal letters sent long ago between her and her father. But what would Sabine Durrant learn about the man who died shortly after she was born?My father died just after I was born and I knew very little about him until I was in my 30s. I was a journalist then, and I approached it like an investigation, writing a memoir about what I discovered – his unhappy childhood, his life as a pilot in the navy, and his disappearance one November night during practice manoeuvres off the Dorset coast. The memoir was published in a book and serialised in a newspaper. After it appeared, my mother talked to me about him not much but enough. She told me he had been a great love, and she told me in heart-rending detail about the night he didn’t come back. We both cried, which was good, because I had got used to thinking she had forgotten him. We had met for lunch, and when we had finished eating she rummaged in her shopper and brought out a plastic bundle, a small Ottakar’s bag containing a thick pile of letters. “You can read these,” she said. “If you like.”I took the letters home, and I was going to read them that night. In some ways, it felt like victory. The teenage me, the one who in secret trawled for evidence, who had raged against her silence – would have drunk them in. I liked to think I had bypassed her in my search, because I hadn’t wanted to upset her. She was long remarried, with a life of her own. But if I am honest it had also been a way of snatching my father from her, of having him to myself. And maybe their letters were too much of a rebuke of this, provided too concrete a proof that he had been a lover, a husband, hardly a father at all. Or perhaps their existence was just too personal – that squeamish resistance all children feel towards parental intimacy. I put the Ottakar’s bag on the table in the hall, and at one point it was moved on top of the piano, and then it graduated into a space on the bookshelves behind. I stopped thinking about it. The bag, with its green logo and arc of orange, wasn’t sealed, the top with the handles just folded over, but it gave the impression of being bound in Sellotape and masking tape, of being as impenetrable as a cage.Things have changed while the letters have sat there. I had two small children when my mother gave them to me, my third child is now 14. The Ottakar’s in Putney Exchange, where my mother bought her books, was taken over by Waterstone’s many years ago. And for the last 18 months my mother hasn’t shopped there anyway, because the summer before last she went to a wedding in Canada and when she came back she discovered she had cancer and two weeks later she died.I’d always thought of death as something unusual, out of the ordinary, exceptionally unfair. Having a dead dad had made me interesting at school. Now, with the full force of my own mortality, I realise how ordinary death is. There’s nothing interesting at my age about having a dead parent. Lots of my friends are orphans, too. And the pain of it is very different. I had grown used to thinking of my father’s death as a hole, but now I realise it was a rock, a solid object, something you could rub up against. It’s the death of someone you have known and argued with and been frustrated by and loved – that’s a hole, that’s a crevice you have to stop yourself from falling down.I used to collect objects that had belonged to my father – a paisley dressing gown, a hand-knitted jumper, a copy of Knots, Splices and Fancy Work, squirrel them away like talismans, proof he had existed. Faced with the onslaught of my mother’s effects, I could hardly bear to keep a thing. I wrestled her possessions into bags, manhandled them out of the house. Off you go. You’re not welcome here. I asked a friend to take away her little watch, get it out of my sight. But my friend cleaned it and wrapped it in tissue paper and brought it back pressing it in my hand she said she thought I might regret not keeping it. And I knew she was probably right, but the truth of that felt a long way off.Eighteen months have passed now and I am glad I have the watch. I wish I had more not the clothes, perhaps, but the emails that disappeared, in a glitch with my server, and which I decided not to try to retrieve. I long to hear her voice, to have a bit of her back just for a moment. And as a result those old love letters have taken on a different force. I began to think again about reading them, circling the idea, like prodding a bruise – aware this time that it was more about her than him. I wouldn’t be reading them to discover, but to recover – to rewind time, to hear my mother’s words. She had given them to me. She had meant me to read them. And it began to feel like neglect, that I had somehow let her down.Yesterday, I decided to pick them up at least, to feel the weight of them. But we had the decorators in last year and the bookshelf where I was expecting to find the solid package, between Jane Bown’s photographs and the RHS Book of Gardening, was just a neat row of hardback fiction. I went upstairs, to a room we call my study, where I would surely have put it for safe keeping. But it’s a bit of a mess at the moment, a teenage dumping ground, and I began hurling things out – clothes meant for Depop, and broken lamps – and with a growing sense of desperation, shouted: “Where’s the Ottakar’s bag?” And when my partner shouted back, “What Ottakar’s bag?” I felt an overwhelming sense of sickness and loss, remembering all the other precious things I had neglected – including my father’s old jumper and my mother’s emails – and when finally I did find it, carelessly thrown behind some photo albums, coated in builder’s dust, I was crying.I didn’t know when I started writing this whether I would actually read them. I thought I would that essay about my father was a way to control emotions that felt otherwise overwhelming. But there is the old resistance – a feeling that they are not mine to look at. The packet has been in front of me while I have been typing, heavier and more substantial than I remembered a proper clout. I have begun to sigh a lot, those heavy tussles with breath that are an attempt to keep anguish at bay. But I am getting closer. Between that sentence and this I opened the bag and saw how each identical pale blue envelope has been neatly dated in my mother’s hand, that they  two years, 1961 and 62, the time before they were married, before I was born. There are 71 letters, and they were sent to different addresses – Brussels, Queen’s Gate, Copse Hill – all in the same spikey writing.And it comes as a shock, this. I don’t know why I hadn’t realised it before, that they are not a correspondence. Her letters to him would have been received at base or at sea, on the move, read, perhaps kept for a bit, but ultimately discarded. These, cherished and dated and placed in this bag the morning she met me: they are all from him to her. Fifteen years ago it wouldn’t have mattered. But today there is an immediate ache of disappointment, that she isn’t to be found here after all.A couple were loose, out of sequence, and I cast my eye over them. My dearest Anne (9 Jan 61), To my darling, darling Anne (Sept 62). The first was sent from HMS Victorious and is full of boyish high spirits: “There is a gale blowing at present so flying has been rather tricky as the flight deck moves round rather a lot making landing very difficult.” The second, written at Hal Far, is full of longing. “I’m too miserable here without you to write very much.” It’s enough. The poignancy is too painful in view of what was to come.I slip the letters back into the bag and I lay it at my feet. I think about her taking the letters from wherever it was she kept them (not her desk) and the love in her decision to give them to me. Was it by her bed, that bookshop bag? Had she just bought herself a novel? I think about how much she liked Ottakar’s in Putney, the layout, and the nice Costa on the second floor, where she would order an Americano, and her tendency to chide the shop assistant, if I didn’t get there in time, for not prominently displaying my books.And I remember the expression on her face when she gave me the letters. She had a habit, my mother, of showing you her holiday photographs while holding them in such a firm grip you had to strain your neck to see – quite often I experienced entire cruises upside down. And that’s what I think of when I remember this handing over. She was still holding tightly to the bag, not really letting go, even when they were already in my hand.Take Me In, by Sabine Durrant, is published on 28 June by Mulholland, at £12.99.

The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8085faf324d481368a475817df9fda8c773ccaf/0_74_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca85a8c05dc86902ef588ae7a85a95ab","title":"facebook journalism publishers","story":"George Orwell wrote in his essay Politics and the English Language: “In our age there is no such thing as ‘keeping out of politics’. All issues are political issues.” When Facebook constructed a new archive of political advertising, had it thought a little more about this concept of what is “political”, it might have more accurately anticipated the subsequent Orwellian headache. As it is, journalists are finding their articles restricted from promotion because they are lumped in with campaigning materials from politicians, lobby groups and advocacy organisations.The new archive of ads with political content, which Facebook made public last month, has become the latest contested piece of territory between platforms and publishers. The complaint from publishers is that Facebook is categorising posts in which they are promoting their own journalism (paying money to target particular groups of the audience) as “political ads”. Publishers have reacted furiously to what they see as toxic taxonomy.Mark Thompson, the chief executive of the New York Times, has been the most vocal critic, describing Facebook’s practices as “a threat to democracy” and criticising the platform in a recent speech to the Open Markets Initiative in Washington DC. “When it comes to news, Facebook still doesn’t get it,” said Thompson. “In its effort to clear up one bad mess, it seems to be joining those who want to blur the line between reality-based journalism and propaganda.”At a separate event at Columbia University, Thompson and Facebook’s head of news partnerships, Campbell Brown, fought openly about the initiative. Thompson showed examples of where New York Times articles, including recipes, had been wrongly flagged as political. Brown emphasised that the archive was being refined, but stood firm on the principle that promoted journalism ought to be flagged as “paid-for” political posts. “On this you are just wrong,” she told Thompson.Publishers took to social platforms to question the labelling and representation of their work. One of the most egregious examples came from investigative journalism organisation Reveal. Last week, at the height of the scandal around the separation of undocumented migrant families crossing the US border, it published an exclusive story involving the alleged drugging of children at a centre housing immigrant minors. It was flagged in the Facebook system as containing political content, and as Reveal had not registered its promotion of the story, the promoted posts were stifled. Facebook did not remove the article, but rather stopped its paid circulation. Given the importance of paid promotion, it is not surprising that publishers see this as amounting to the same thing.The furore and confusion over what had happened to the post demonstrated that publishers were themselves confused about the new system. It also demonstrated the way in which even a well-intentioned initiative to add more clarity to political advertising could in fact militate against the rapid spread of what many would consider important high-quality news.Many people who use Facebook remain unaware that what shows up in their news feed can get there two ways: it is targeted by an algorithm based on their behaviour, profile and preferences and often it is targeted at their demographic by paid promotion. It is routine for publishers to pay to boost pages of their own journalism in order for them to reach a wider audience. In fact for many publishers it is a prerequisite of being read, as Facebook does not recognise or seek to categorise good journalism or urgent news over any other material.It is precisely these mechanics which led in the 2016 US election cycle to the platform playing host to all types of propaganda and “fake news” often masquerading as legitimate journalism. The idea that Facebook should add transparency to what was being paid for as political advertising was almost universally welcomed as a “first step” to combating misinformation.The friction over its implementation highlights a key tension within Facebook and all tech companies when it comes to dealing with cultural concepts. Should companies just rely far more heavily on human judgment or should they leave it to algorithms?Robots, algorithms, computers and maths are amazingly potent in their capacity to sort unique objects: faces, places, images and text can be searched and identified quickly at great scale. But things which are not unique, or which carry with them inherent ambiguity – such as culture, politics, humanity even – are unsuited to evaluation by any kind of artificial intelligence application. Orwell was right, everything is political: holiday photos are political fashion, weddings, theatre and film, architecture, are all in one sense political. (Maybe it is only the cat picture which the whole of the internet can agree on as being apolitical.)In deciding that a New Yorker piece in praise of adultery is “political”, the Facebook advertising archive algorithm might be making a profound, almost philosophical, judgment about hetero-normative values, but more likely it is just incompetently sorting material it can’t recognise. These examples are good copy, but essentially teething problems that Facebook has the capacity to solve.However, there are profound issues about the nature and control of the public sphere. As the large platforms now effectively are the internet for many people, their governance structures are of key public interest. If categorisation as being “political” has consequences for how fact-based reporting is perceived both by the public and by the algorithm, this could be catastrophic. It could lead to local news or urgent political coverage being harder to find – or prioritised according only to the amount a publisher or advertiser spends.The second is that Facebook is to some extent on the right side of the argument when it comes to labelling content. But it is unfortunately ill-equipped to deal with the type and scale of the task it has created for itself. There is a looming civic crisis in the field of political communications. The provenance of material masquerading as news often deliberately obscures funding sources and influences comb the Facebook political advertising archive around any keyword and you will find a host of apparently neutral news media entities which are funded and controlled by hyper-partisan groups. And these groups can also pay to promote articles from other news organisations in pursuit of their own aims. The number of New York Times articles paid for by candidates boosting their own campaigns is just as large as the Times’s own promotional strategies.The unavoidable core of this issue is taking transparency into the realm of political judgment, and separating legitimate news sources from non-legitimate. Nobody, including Facebook, wishes this organisation to have such a level of control over the free press or even political campaigning. The answer to Facebook, as has often been said, cannot be more Facebook.News and journalism are now dependent on Facebook, Google, Twitter, Apple and others for many aspects of their existence. What is clear is that these companies are not inherently suited to be custodians of our information ecosystem, and arguably never will be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f758c93ab7c0cac9328be72eea199fa6ea04d9af/0_103_4134_2482/master/4134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80330a8c2ffc27a18defbfa51068750c","title":"voices of the peoples march we have been sold a lie","story":"People from all over the UK gathered in London to join the anti-Brexit rally and air their views on leaving the EU“I just feel that we have been sold a lie. People didn’t understand what the referendum would mean. And now, two years down the line, it’s still not clear what we were voting for.“They were sold this lie about the NHS,” said Ankle, referring to the widely discredited leavers’ claim that it would make £350m a week available for the health service. At the march with a friend who had travelled from Scotland, she also said she was concerned that the Brexit campaign had played to prejudices. “When I was listening to the campaign, it just seemed a very racially motivated campaign, and I didn’t like it.”“I’m 86 and I remember why we went into Europe: people wanted to prevent another war. During the campaign, no one pointed out the advantages of the European Union. Wherever I go, I travel all over the world, people ask me, ‘why did you vote for Brexit? What are you doing?’ I call it the biggest self-inflicted harm in British history.”“I feel absolutely devastated by Brexit, and I wanted to stand up and be counted. The signs didn’t take very long – they took about a week,” said Isabel, who didn’t want to give her full name.“I remember, before we were in the Common Market, you were lucky if you had one peach a week, because that was all you could afford, because they were imported from Italy and you had to pay the Common Market tariffs. It was the same with all vegetables.“It’s also the idea of Europe: I studied languages, I have friends in Germany and other places in Europe.”The 44-year-old software engineer dragged his two children away from their school’s summer fair to attend, the first time any of them had been to a protest.“Dad said you shouldn’t go to the fair, there are more important things,” said Magnus. His sister, Isla, said her dad’s arguments had convinced her, even though she regretted missing the fair. “I was worried that not enough people would come,” she said. Ben Moseley said: “We have big problems in this country, and we can’t ignore the fact that many people are very unhappy. But Brexit will only make things worse. Separating from the EU is a huge distraction from what’s really important in this country.”“This march is about having a people’s vote. It’s not about whether you voted leave or remain, it started with a referendum and it can only fairly finish with a people’s vote when we know what the options are. A yes or no vote didn’t go into the minutiae, and now that we are into that, what was promised is not appearing. We were sold a lie.Several of my friends voted for Brexit, and I don’t know two of them who voted for the same reason. So saying ‘the people have spoken’ is a slightly misleading statement.“Its not easy explaining to him what the European Union is, but I think he’s got some of the idea now.” Felix’s mother is German and Lee is Canadian, they met in the UK and made it their home. “As a Commonwealth citizen, I could vote in the referendum, but my wife as a European couldn’t.”“The funding for support for young people has been horrific since the Tories came to power, and Brexit is only going to make things worse.”“Really we’d like Brexit to stop, because I think it’s a disastrous, suicidal idea ... I profited from the EU by living and working in Germany, and didn’t think at the time that I needed German citizenship I now very much regret that I didn’t apply for it.“We were lied to when we voted in the Scottish independence referendum. We were told that if we voted for independence, we’d be straight out of the EU, and the only way to guarantee staying in the EU was to stay in the union. And a number of people foolishly believed that, and I think a lot of those people are very cross now.”“Its a pile of bollocks, really. I thought of a whole load of things to say (on my banner), but that sums it up.“I’m not really political,” she said. “I feel deeply ashamed and horrified about what’s happening, and I don’t feel Brexit is representative of what we are as a country.”“I think, really, we are a genuinely good-hearted, multicultural, generous people, and I think we are showing ourselves up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a95fb16beae6ddda99ed0b99355c3a9e7326f8f/789_174_4078_2448/master/4078.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=782abb234b3a64c3d091b2a464e0c0b8","title":"hardline tories tell theresa may get ready for no deal brexit","story":"Ex-cabinet ministers among those who say leaving EU with no trade deal must be an optionTheresa May has been urged by hardline Brexiters to speed up preparations for a “no-deal” Brexit to put pressure on Brussels during withdrawal negotiations.Sixty former cabinet ministers, MPs, economists and business figures signed a letter to the prime minister urging her to issue orders to departments to accelerate planning for Britain to operate under World Trade Organization rules if a deal cannot be done. They argue that in order to have “real leverage in the Brexit endgame” the UK must reserve the right to walk away without a trade deal “and take with it the £39bn it has offered to pay as part of a orce settlement”. Their intervention came after more than 100,000 people marched through London on the second anniversary of the EU referendum to demand a fresh vote on the terms of the Brexit deal. Politicians from across the political spectrum took part in the People’s Vote rally on Saturday as the isions over withdrawal from the European Union showed no sign of narrowing.Signatories to the letter, organised by Economists for Free Trade (EFT) and released on Saturday, include the former chancellor Lord Lawson, ex-environment secretary Owen Paterson and one-time Wales secretary John Redwood, plus Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin and Sir Rocco Forte, chairman of Rocco Forte Hotels. In it they urge May to warn her European counterparts that despite their “intransigent and punitive stance” they cannot delay or block Brexit.They go on to say: “We believe you could also make clear that your preferred outcome is a free trade deal between Britain and the EU, an arrangement that is to the mutual benefit of both parties. “Britain is a great champion of free trade and looks forward to striking free trade deals with countries beyond the shores of the continent once Brexit has taken effect.“However, in light of the reluctance of the EU swiftly to secure a free trade deal – eminently possible since we have been trading freely with the EU for more than 40 years – we suggest you make clear your belief that the UK has now to prepare urgently for the possibility that no agreement is forthcoming. “Accordingly, we believe now is the time to issue instructions to UK authorities to accelerate their preparations for ‘no deal’ and a move to a World Trade Deal under WTO rules that, after all, govern the vast majority of global trading arrangements today.” Other signatories to the letter include Conservative MPs Peter Bone, Sir Christopher Chope, Philip Davies, Richard Drax, Philip Hollobone, Andrea Jenkyns, Anne Main, Nigel Mills, Henry Smith and William Wragg. The letter insists that Britain can “flourish”, even without a free trade deal, because of the benefits of leaving the EU, adding: “This would give the chancellor ample scope to increase spending on priority public services such as the NHS while reducing the too high UK tax burden.” A Downing Street source said: “We are confident of getting a good deal that delivers for every part of the UK and allows us to take back control of our money, rules and borders.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae6a2b7d7203ab0d300e7e16858e731708f2c442/0_1656_5478_3287/master/5478.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a5b08c74772018565b40559cc31c8d4","title":"nathan myhrvold inventor microsoft patent nasa asteroid data pizza science","story":"Nathan Myhrvold is the former chief technology officer of Microsoft, founder of the controversial patent asset company Intellectual Ventures and the main author of the six-volume, 2,300-page Modernist Cuisine cookbook, which explores the science of cooking. Currently, he is taking on Nasa over its measurement of asteroid sizes.Why does it matter? As you admit in your blogpost, obsessively arguing over the size of rocks that are millions of miles away may appear esoteric. Asteroids are very important. They tell us a lot about the origin of the solar system. The work of hundreds of scientists has been based on this Neowise data. Also, a major asteroid impact will affect life on Earth at some point, just as it has multiple times in the past. The data are critical to assessing this risk. If there is a mistake by a factor of two in the diameter, which there are for a bunch, that’s a mistake of a factor of eight in the energy.Nasa’s reported response has been to stand by the data and the analysis performed by the Neowise team. Can we trust Nasa after this?They need to have an independent investigation of these results. When my preprint paper came out in 2016, they said: “You shouldn’t believe it because it’s not peer-reviewed.” Well, now it has been peer reviewed. How Nasa handles it at this stage will be very telling. People have suggested to me the reason Nasa doesn’t want to admit that anything is wrong with the data is that they’re afraid it would hurt the chances of Neocam, an approximately $500m (£380m) telescope to find asteroids that might hit Earth proposed by the same group who did the Neowise analysis.In 2015, you built this robotic model of a dinosaur tail that showed a dinosaur could break the sound barrier when it cracked its tail. You also fund palaeontology digs and I believe you keep a lifesize T-rex skeleton in your living room. Are you working on anything dinosaur-related at the moment?One thing is a big comparative study to try to understand why dinosaurs got so damn big. A lot of it has to do not with why dinosaurs got so big, but why mammals are small. Mammals have some problems when they’re very large – like pregnancy – that dinosaurs didn’t have. For dinosaurs, laying eggs made it a lot easier to be big.In 2000, you left Microsoft and set up Intellectual Ventures, which primarily buys and licenses patents. The business is often vilified as one of the world’s biggest “patent trolls”. Why do you think people find it so loathsome?I fundamentally think what we do is good. It is hard for me to get too worked up about figuring out why it is bad. Any patent holder who enforces their rights gets called a patent troll. Silicon Valley feels very threatened by anything that could challenge its authority. If you are one of the big companies, like Google or Apple, almost no one can challenge you in the market that you’re in. But if somebody has a patent, they can ask for a bunch of money. The more you can get a return from an invention, the better off the world will be. It will lead to more inventions being funded and more inventing.How many patents do you have?I’d guess altogether we have around 30,000. Around 8,000 of those my company invented. Personally I\u0026nbspprobably have about 800. It changes every Tuesday, which is the day the patent office issues patents. We still only have a drop in the bucket. There are around 4m active US patents.Intellectual Ventures also has this “global good” arm that is collaborating with Bill Gates. What are some of the inventions coming out of that and how close are they to fruition?We’ve invented a vaccine container that keeps vaccine cold even without refrigeration. That has played a crucial role in the Ebola outbreaks and has been rolled out across Africa for other diseases. It has made an enormous difference in people’s lives. One that’s coming is we’ve invented a very cheap, noninvasive test for cervical cancer. It does remarkably better than any other technique. We designed it for developing countries but there is interest in using it here in the US, too. We take a picture of the cervix. We have a machine-learning algorithm that learned how to diagnose cervical cancer by looking at pictures. Our latest thing is a plastic speculum, a rubber band, and an iPhone. It’s really cheap and it only takes a minute. We’re working on diagnostic trials.You also have commercial spinouts from Intellectual Ventures. One of them is developing a new kind of nuclear reactor. What’s different about it and where are you towards building it?For a very long time there was really not that much effort put in to designing radical new kinds of reactors. Instead, everyone made tiny little modifications to old reactors. We realised that, so we got into the game. There are a tremendous number of opportunities that one has to make reactors that are cheaper, safer, and which can do really cool things like burn nuclear waste as fuel. That’s really important because the world has thousands of tonnes of nuclear waste sitting around that is otherwise a big problem.Turning that into fuel that would be fantastic and we are looking at projects in China and other parts of the world. Nuclear reactors take a long time to build, but we’re hoping in the 2020s we’ll see our first.President Trump is going after China’s intellectual property theft. Given your experience, can he succeed in curbing it?The theft of intellectual property by Chinese companies is a very serious issue. It’s not just private companies in China or little companies. A\u0026nbsplarge amount of it is state-owned enterprise. So, it really is the Chinese government doing it. Exactly how to solve that issue, I don’t know. You need the Chinese government to be very serious about it, but so far they haven’t been. In my experience in business, you mostly do better with negotiating in quiet diplomacy, not with brinksmanship. But I’ve never built luxury hotels and golf courses. Maybe it is different there.Your cookbooks, most recently Modernist Bread, cost hundreds of dollars, weigh kilograms and are full of striking photos that you took. You’re in Brazil researching your next book, about pizza. What does Brazil have to do with pizza?The US has had pizza since lots of immigrants from Italy brought it with them in the late 19th century. Well, so, too, for Brazil and Argentina, which is our next stop. One of the things about pizza is, when it goes to some new area, people tend to mutate it and develop their own unique style. One of the styles of Brazilian pizza is an ultra-thin crust: thinner than a cracker, and stiff, with a thin layer of\u0026nbsptoppings. Also, because they have lots of tropical ingredients, you get pizzas with bananas on. Sliced hard-boiled eggs are also pretty common.You use innovative photography techniques and custom-made equipment to show food in a whole different way. Many people post pictures of their brunch on Instagram. Do you have any tips for better shots?It’s really hard to get a good shot with the flash that’s on your cell phone, so you usually want to turn that off. Very bright, directional light also usually looks bad: you get harsh shadows. You want a broad light source near your food. Get near a window. Of course, some restaurants, for reasons I still don’t understand, make it so damn dark. I think it’s supposed to be romantic or something.What’s next due a “Nathaning”? It is really hard for me to predict what’s going to be next. Many of the things I am doing now I wouldn’t have predicted I would be doing a couple years ago. On the cooking front, at some point we have to address dessert, but we haven’t figured out how yet. We’re still working on pizza."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b77809a67d02f46aa4c56171968bf02c3533915d/0_92_5116_3070/master/5116.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a02813be6c1b328f3f151a06e42a51b","title":"social housing no longer option young families","story":"Struggling young families have seen their access to social housing fall as fast as their chances of buying a home, according to new analysis of the housing crisis.The shrinking stock of social housing has seen the share of young families who live in it fall by around a third over the past 20 years, with 400,000 fewer living in council and housing association homes. It comes despite the rising need for low-cost homes.The latest research, carried out by the Resolution Foundation, highlights another aspect of the intergenerational ide. It found that the decline in social renting by young families has coincided with rising levels of “housing stress”, as the proportion of families spending more than a third of their disposable income on housing costs rises across the population.About one in 10 low and middle-income families now face housing stress. However, younger families in the bottom half of the income distribution have been hit with the sharpest increases, with one in five households headed by an under 35-year-old being forced to pay what many regard as an unaffordable amount for their home.The fall in access to home ownership for the young – as a result of rising prices and stagnant wages – has become a major issue for the government, with senior Tories desperate to see purchasing a house become a possibility once again for new families.The research shows that poorer young families also lack the option of social housing. The share of young people in the bottom half of the income distribution living in social rented accommodation has fallen as fast as home ownership. Both fell by more than 10 percentage points between 1996 and 2016.This is partly as a result of the Right to Buy policy, which saw those in council houses allowed to buy their home at a discount. It has meant that older occupiers of social housing had access to properties and were helped into home ownership. A depleted stock of social housing has never been replenished, leaving the young increasingly reliant on private rentals that come with high costs and insecure tenancies.In fact, the research finds that for many young adults their best hope of living in social housing is to stay in their parents’ home, as part of the so-called “boomerang generation”.There are hopes that a long-term decline in social housing is beginning to turn around. Last year ministers vowed to build more homes for social rent, backed by the promise of £2bn of support.Lindsay Judge, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Britain has a proud history of providing social housing. But the sector has been in decline for decades and is too often ignored in national debates about housing.“It’s welcome that the government has finally recognised the need for social housing and that we are talking about the sector again after the tragedy of Grenfell last year. But there needs to be a lasting shift that sees Britain’s social housing providers rise to the challenge of providing the homes that so many young families in particular need.”Prime minister Theresa May has made housing a priority of her domestic agenda, but there are concerns on Tory benches that Brexit has led to a lack of action in other areas.A government-backed commission has concluded that action is needed to speed up the rate of housebuilding. The review by former cabinet minister Oliver Letwin, to be published tomorrow, finds that thousands more British bricklayers need to be trained to help meet building targets.It suggests that a shortage of British bricklayers will have a “significant biting constraint” on government plans to boost the number of new homes built from 220,000 a year to 300,000.It also concludes that housebuilders are limiting the number of newly-built homes released to prevent a glut on the market hitting prices. Letwin says developers could increase the choice of design, size and tenure of new homes without impacting on the local market and therefore speed up the rate at which houses are built and sold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20a94e383385cace9ab6b14858cd0f5479c6f13a/0_72_1968_1181/master/1968.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8611c5515b5b5532e46157fae2eb7ff","title":"england v australia fifth odi live","story":"21st over: England 78-5 (target 206 Buttler 32, Ali 10) Buttler also had Ashes problems with Lyon, though his were back in 2015. He gets away with a risky stroke here, dragging an attempted reverse sweep past leg stump. It would have hit the stumps had it not hit the back of the bat in his follow through.“I love filth,” says Jane Tubby. “I appreciate your usage of the word in both OBO and MBM!”20th over: England 76-5 (target 206 Buttler 31, Ali 9) This is sensible cricket from Buttler and Moeen, who are dealing exclusively in low-risk singles while the dangerous Stanlake is bowling. He has three overs remaining and England need 130 from the last 30 overs.19th over: England 72-5 (target 206 Buttler 29, Ali 7) Lyon, who took possession of Moeen during the Ashes, beats him outside off stump with an excellent delivery. Australia are pushing hard for wickets before Moeen gets his eye in.18th over: England 69-5 (target 206 Buttler 28, Ali 5) Billy Stanlake, who rampaged through England’s top order, starts at the other end. He only has five overs left but Tim Paine knows a wicket here would give England all sorts of agita. Buttler, who reads the game very well, is content to see him off rather than take any risks.17th over: England 68-5 (target 206 Buttler 28, Ali 4) Hello, Rob here. Nathan Lyon bowls the first over after the interval. Two from it, nothing much to report.Right, that’s me done. Thanks for your company both today and yesterday. Rob is just wrapping up the MBM and will be with you for the first ball in about four minutes. Here’s to Billy Stanlake andor Jos Buttler determining who wins this match. Adios.“I have a theory that England can only be successful at one sport at a time,” writes Tom V d Gucht. Please continue. “One of the reasons the rugby team lost last week is because the match coincided with a ODI that was won convincingly. Now the cricket team have to lose as the football team are playing a blinder. It’s just how the sporting gods in England operate.” On the other hand, as an Australian (however dispassionate), I strongly believe that the Cricket Gods (interchangable with Footy Gods) will deny the visitors because they took Stanlake off before the break. They will be punished for it, rest assured. 16th over: England 66-5 (Buttler 27, Moeen 3) Target 206 So close to having Buttler! He drives hard at Richardson but doesn’t get all of it through cover, Head having time to launch to his right inside the circle. He’s probably six inches short of being able to touch it but instead four runs are recorded as the vice-captain moves into the 20s. To the penultimate ball before the break, Paine stands up to the stumps and the bowler drops short, Buttler up to the task of cutting four more. Last ball, and it is a full toss! Buttler would normally pop that on the moon but instead takes the single on offer to fine leg. So, 11 taken from it as they walk off for lunch. Phew. Take a breath. I’m going to grab a plate of food and watch the end of the football. I suggest you do the same. Back shortly. 15th over: England 55-5 (Buttler 16, Moeen 3) Target 206 Lyon getting the last over before lunch and that’s clever as he’s sending it down at Moeen, who he, as the kids say (or did a while ago), pwned during the Ashes. Sure enough, Moeen does something daft in response to his nemesis, taking a quick single that would have seen him run out by metres had the throw hit. I think it was Travis Head. Either way, opportunity missed. Just the two singles from the over... and it won’t be lunch. They will sneak one more in. 14th over: England 53-5 (Buttler 15, Moeen 2) Target 206 Richardson locates Buttler’s outside edge as well, spitting out to point for two. Nicely bowled. Moeen turns a couple of singles around the corner to get his day underway. Three singles along with the wicket of Hales.Alex, mate, what are you doing? That was so wide from Richardson it would have been signalled so if not for the fact that Hales has arms long enough to nick it behind. 13th over: England 50-4 (Hales 20, Buttler 14) Target 206 Agar to Hales, down the ground to begin for one, Buttler likewise. Easiser now. The crowd are up, Harry has scored again, then once more more moments later as Australia reach their 50. 12th over: England 47-4 (Hales 18, Buttler 13) Target 206 Stanlake has been taken off and I just don’t understand anything anymore. Yes, they can give him a break and he can go again after lunch. Yes, he’s already bowled five. But he’s sending down HEAT and Buttler is a long, long way from set. Sure enough, Jos responds by driving Richardson with ease through cover for a couple. Paine, immediately, up to the stumps. Buttler then goes over the top of cover for four. Talk about stunting momentum. What a waste. 11th over: England 41-4 (Hales 18, Buttler 7) Target 206 Agar though Buttler! The smallest inside edge saving him, missing the leg stump by barely a ball-width. Four handy runs in the current circumstances. With the field out, Buttler able to play a more composed drive to the sweeper later in the over to keep the strike. 10th over: England 34-4 (Hales 17, Buttler 1) Target 206 This is RAPID from Stanlake, consecutive deliveries sent down at 92 then 93mph, the latter way too quick for Buttler’s blade. He’s then finally off the mark squeezing a drive out to third man. A looser delivery to finish, which Hales leaps with a crunch to the point rope. The end of an eventful power play. Stanlake must stay on for a couple more here. 9th over: England 28-4 (Hales 12, Buttler 0) Target 206 Agar back after one Lyon over, presumably because southpaw Morgan has been and gone. Just a single down the ground early in the set from Hales, Buttler playing out the rest respectfully. Noteworthy: he’s faced six balls without scoring. 8th over: England 27-4 (Hales 11, Buttler 0) Target 206 Buttler in during the eighth over wasn’t England’s plan, they just wanted to watch the football in the sheds. No. You’ve got some work to do here. Defending and defending again. Wicket Maiden for Billy! PHWOAR! 88 miles of the best, Billy Stanlake has put Australia into the Delorean and back to happier times! He is through the gate of Morgan with a SCREAMER! Leg stump bent back, the captain is gone for a duck.  7th over: England 27-3 (Hales 11, Morgan 0) Target 206 Lyon to continue with spin from the Anderson End. Hales has the offie’s measure to begin, smashing an elegant cover drive through the field, still up during this power play period. But the experienced bowler is straight back on it, pinning him to the crease for the remainder of the set.Billy! Oh Billy! Root tries to punch the final ball of the over off the back foot but places an edge into the waiting hands of Marsh at slip who makes no mistake. That flew to him. Fast, probing bowling from the Queenslander. Game on! Maybe! Now, hold on! Australia might be back in this with Stanlake getting the wicket he deserves for his work so far this afternoon, YJB chopping a ball on that he tried to cut but was too close for that. A nice bit of movement off the seam brought the error. 5th over: England 19-1 (Bairstow 12, Hales 4) Target 206 A couple behind square leg from Bairstow and a couple of wides that easily could have been leg byes. Agar going nicely in this power play. It could turn into a strategy they roll out more often. Dipak Patel, anyone?4th over: England 15-1 (Bairstow 10, Hales 4) Target 206 Edge, four! Stanlake really getting it through here and Bairstow lucky to still be there. It would have landed safely with second slip. As Jimmy Anderson says on TMS, the big quick has been positive of this tour for the visitors. I reckon he’ll be back next year for the World Cup. Meanwhile, 5-0  5-0 will surely guarantee that cricket sneaks onto the back pages tomorrow, right? 3rd over: England 8-1 (Bairstow 3, Hales 4) Target 206 It is only the second time that an Australian spinner has bowled the first ball of an innings, Andy Zaltzman tells us on TMS. Lyon the first, a couple of years ago against India. I reckon that might have been in Canberra. Anyway, it is Agar here as... Old Trafford rise once more! What a lovely goal that was. Sorry, I mean, Hales off the mark with a delightful on-drive. A true example of making something difficult look rather easy. Four-nil in the football, four-nil in the cricket. Zing! (Could be 5-0 and 5-0 in about two hours)2nd over: England 3-1 (Bairstow 2, Hales 0) Target 206 Old Trafford go up for a third time but it isn’t due to the pace Stanlake gets through the ‘keeper, fair to say. What a finish from Lingard. Billy has got it zipping around, right on the money to Hales who can’t yet get himself off the mark.1st over: England 2-1 (Bairstow 1, Hales 0) Target 206 Hales defending the last couple here to see out the successful over. Can’t ask much more of Agar than that. Roy dances and tries to smash Agar into the stands but he’s bowled through the gate by the left-arm spinner sliding through the gate. “Probably trying to hit it too hard,” the assessment of Jimmy Anderson on TMS.Another big roar! Old Trafford love the Harry Kane penalty (and what a penalty!). England 2-0 in the 22nd minute after smashing through Australia for 205.To think Head and Finch had them rocking along at 60-0 in the seventh over. But once again, it was spin that did it as it has been throughout. Moeen snuck through Finch then prompted a terrible shot from Stoinis in the space of a couple of balls. Marsh became his third due to Buttler’s fast gloves after Plunkett had Head - who looked so good for 56 - softly pushing to midwicket. It never got better for the visitors, their innings summed up by the dismissal of the captain Paine, who was run out magnificently by Buttler. They are back out there now with a five-nil defeat almost certain. Paine has his helmet on as it will be Agar to begin. They will play an hour before taking lunch. Here come Roy and Bairstow, who will try to knock the 206 runs on their own. Don’t doubt it. PLAY! A predictable end, Stanlake deep in the crease trying to pull but misses a straight one. Moeen finishes with 446. Wonderful effort to get the job done inside 35 overs. 34th over: Australia 200-9 (Short 42, Stanlake 2) The temporary stand launch into a standing ovation when Australia pass 200 as Short turns Rashid around the corner. Fun, fun. The leggie, with 12 scalps, now has more than any English spinner in a bilateral series. Stanlake beaten then pads away a crowd catch close to the bat but he surives.33rd over: Australia 197-9 (Short 41, Stanlake 1) Moeen back and that’s fair enough given how well he has bowled this series, he deserves to pick up the final wicket. Not to be here though, Short productive early then Stanlake solid enough at the end.32nd over: Australia 193-9 (Short 38, Stanlake 0) Stanlake survives three balls by throwing his huge front leg forward and hoping nothing gets through. Decent enough strategy at this stage against Rashid, who has been excellent. With Rob taking over from me at 3pm, is it possible Roy and YJB will have the runs knocked off beforehand? Huge roar around Old Trafford as Stones finishes wonderfully from a corner at the exact moment that Rashid slips through Lyon with a lovely wrong’un! The Australian reviewed but only because he had to. He knew. Three Lions plays around the ground. 31st over: Australia 192-8 (Short 37, Lyon 1) Lovely from Curran, doing everything but finding Lyon’s edge at the back end of his zippy set, beating him twice. Earlier, Short struck another fluent drive through extra cover for four. He’s doing a fine job here but has to bat through to the end. 30th over: Australia 187-8 (Short 32, Lyon 1) Just the three singles, coming before the excitement of the review. If you can call it at . Peeeeep! Rob Smyth on the tools on the England v Panama MBM and then he’ll be taking over from me when that is finished. Busy boy. NOT OUT! No edge, so not caught, and missing by a long way on ball tracking.ENGLAND GOING UPSTAIRS. Maybe for lbw maybe for caught behind. Either way, Rashid believes he has Lyon. We’ll see. 29th over: Australia 184-8 (Short 30, Lyon 0) Ifwhen England finish this before 2pm there will be a ten minute changeover and lunch will be taken at 2:30pm. Grim, ay? On the other hand, if they can grab them both this over, they should be back in the sheds in time to watch the start of the football. Short flicks a couple and drives another off Curran. Nathan Lyon is beaten by a good’un to finish. What a rollercoaster his international career has been since starting in 2011. There will be a decent book in that.What can you say? Richardson turned to fine leg and just started running. Short sent him back but it was all too late. Moeen’s throw got to Buttler just in time. The end. It was the ball after Richardson plonked Rashid for six over long-on but that doesn’t matter now. Shambles.IS RICHARDSON RUN OUT? I reckon he might be. We’ll see shortly. It’s a shocker... 27th over: Australia 172-7 (Short 26, Richardson 6) Short, who has been watching the chaos from the other end, gets another chance against Curran. He uses it well, cutting from high in his stance into the gap for his second boundary. “Having just scene the clip of that brilliant run-out by Joss Buttler, I have to say that any Umpire who needs a TV replay to decide on that shouldn’t be in the game at all,” notes Martin Crookall. “He was miles out.” On that: the last time a run out was given on the field without going upstairs?26th over: Australia 165-7 (Short 20, Richardson 5) Richardson living dangerously, trying to slay Rashid but only top-edging to mid-off, just evading the fielder. To finish the over he tried to put him on the moon but missed the ball. Lucky to still have his stumps. “Great to see (read) such belting bowling brilliance from Moeen!” writes Andrew Benton. “He seems to have got his Mo-jo back after the winter down under.”25th over: Australia 163-7 (Short 20, Richardson 3) What a great comeback from Curran after copping some tap earlier on, conceding 25 runs in two overs. As the wickets fell he must have wondered if he would get another opportunity but he’s made the most of it. Richardson, in before the halfway mark of the innings, gets off the mark with a couple through midwicket. “It’s like they are at the end of a three-month tour,” says Michael Vaughan on TMS of Australia. “But they’ve only been here three weeks.”Oh no! Agar has left a ball that has hit middle and off stump! Two in three balls for the man on debut. Good grief, that’s ugly an old-fashioned brain explosion. And Agar, a clever man with a wonderful future ahead of him, knows it too judging by his walk off the field. “That is going to be replayed over and over,” says Charles Dagnall on TMS. Not wrong.That’s the end of Carey, giving Curran his first ODI wicket from his first ball back into the attack! The left-hander tried to steer down to third man but didn’t get enough on it, the edge landing in Buttler’s gloves instead. 24th over: Australia 159-5 (Carey 44, Short 20) I’m being punished for falling behind and have to write this quickly. You’ll understand why in a tick. Ten from the Rashid over, including another boundary for Carey who sweeps nice and fine. Going well. Until...23rd over: Australia 149-5 (Carey 37, Short 17) That’s better! Carey lifts Root straight over his head and over the boundary. Lovely shot for six. This is how the South Australian made his name, clean hitting down the ground in the Big Bash. “It would not surprise me at all if Alex Carey is the captain of this team for the World Cup,” says Michael Vaughan on TMS as he again, slapping through cover for four more. 14 from the Root over. Charles Dagnall notes that Carey has history as an Australian Rules football captain, and that is true. He was the inaugural captain of the GWS Giants, albeit before they were in the top-flight. Had he got a game in the AFL he would join others who reached the top in both sports including Simon O’Donnell, Max Walker and Keith Miller. There are loads more but two spinners are operating and time is scarce. Post! 22nd over: Australia 135-5 (Carey 25, Short 15) Adil Rashid, rinse and repeat. Short tucks one fine to begin then Carey pulls a single square. But Short has no chance to turn it over again, trying to drive but straight to fielders in the old-fashioned ‘V’. Two off it, making 21 from the last five overs. 21st over: Australia 133-5 (Carey 24, Short 14) I am not ignoring you on purpose. My inbox just refreshed (doesn’t it do that automatically???) and there are emails going back well over an hour. I’ll get to them when the spinners have stopped bowling in tandem. Root is back, five singles milked to the sweepers as this young pair find their feet in an effort to rebuilds.20th over: Australia 128-5 (Carey 22, Short 11) Rashid is class. There are a couple of singles on offer but nothing else. I liked that CricViz stat about him the other day. In short: he has bowled, on average, faster every year he has been an international cricketer. In other words, he’s adapted into the ideal T20 wrist spinner. 19th over: Australia 126-5 (Carey 21, Short 10) Moeen one more. Singles around the sweepers, four runs added. Rashid, who turns the ball back at the left-handers, is coming on next. Will they take a stab at taking him down early?

Hamilton’s Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas is in second and Vettel settles for third at the start. The real qualifying success was Charles Leclerc who made it to eighth in a Sauber, which is a minor miracle.But less about the short-term, it really is exciting to be back in France at Paul Ricard. We’ve been away from France for 10 years and they’ve really made a lot of effort to bring F1 back to the country. Patriotism is on show, with the run-off areas painted red and blue, with the colour representing how abrasive an area a driver might be in in order to stop them hitting the wall. The engine upgrade for Mercedes has helped their drivers, providing their first one-two since the Spanish Grand Prix, which is not to be sniffed at.Rain interrupted proceedings yesterday and it might do again today, according to the weather forecast, which would make it a completely different race.Anyway, it’s great to be in France and it really should be a cracker."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c26cd4e8fbbb100dfb62529caef142e28e45243/2057_966_2260_1357/master/2260.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=192222e1ccb9f2e2d976a9dc6e4acf70","title":"gina yashere review underbelly london us daily show race relations","story":"Underbelly, South Bank, LondonThe Londoner turned US Daily Show star shows herself more clown than commentator as she unpicks British race relations and Anglo-Nigerian manners Last month, UK comedy audiences had a visit from Daily Show host Trevor Noah this month, his Brexit correspondent and so-called “actual British person”, Gina Yashere, follows in his footsteps. Famously, Yashere had to quit Britain and its low glass ceiling for black comedians, to get a break. But this homecoming gig shows she has left in body only. She remains every inch the Londoner, and her set navigates the landscape of British race relations and Anglo-Nigerian manners as deftly as if she had never been away.And she does so while largely avoiding the stereotypes in which previous routines have traded. This new show Funkindemup finds Yashere on her finest form – prowling the stage, alpha female, effortlessly in charge, at last enjoying the professional status she always felt she had earned. After some ice-breaking gags about rap music, she starts with a section on Windrush, slavery, and the “subtle, side-eyed racism” of the Brits – who are much cleverer than the Americans, says Yashere, at covering their racist tracks.The content here recalls her Daily Show item on the coverage of Harry Windsor and Meghan Markle’s engagement, as one white person after another expresses innocent surprise that Yashere could possibly be paying a bill or travelling first class. Contrast that – as she then does – with how people look at her in east Asia, which may be racist, or may be confusion about whether she’s female or male. Now we’re in Asia – where Yashere regularly tours – there’s a characteristically pop-eyed routine about hole-in-the-ground toilets, culminating in the deathless punchline: “That’s why when Asians poo, it looks like the emoji …”If you’re feeling queasy about these ethnic generalisations – well, Yashere is on to you. “I can feel white anuses clenching up,” she beams, before commissioning an Anglo-Chinese man in the second row to play referee. If he laughs, then it’s all right, she tells us – which is, of course, a crude and coercive device (that’s part of the joke), and a lovely way to send up and de-fang any liberal anxiety in the room. Of which there is little, because Yashere is always more ridiculous than contentious, and more clown than social commentator.Later in the show, we’re treated to Yashere’s account of a dust-up she recently had outside a Washington DC nightclub, and insights into her life as a Brooklyn gentrifier seething at the Jamaican party animal next door. She tries to complain – but her body can’t help dancing. The final section of the show is the most personal, as Yashere discusses her relationship with her African roots, coming out, and her recent experience of introducing a white American girlfriend to her prim Nigerian mother.I call it personal, and so it is – but none of it feels intimate. Yashere doesn’t give any more of herself away than is required to be funny, and her comedy unfolds along familiar lines, as her mother refuses to hear about Gina’s homosexuality (“I’m walking away!”) and firmly disciplined African kids marvel to hear white friends address their parents by – horror of horrors! – their actual names. It’s the comedy of cultural difference, served up in the conventional way but with no little flair from a woman who has got her career where she wants it – and, on this showing, deservedly so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b12cc0192d393bb102059442a139afa09d9ddc9a/0_1283_8424_5054/master/8424.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4da247fa1b4039f7df3f0d34ec15b844","title":"picture resort from sandy beaches to stunning art galleries in st ives","story":"The Tate St Ives extension gives art lovers a perfect excuse to revisit this beguiling townSt Ives is a British seaside resort like no other. It has sandy beaches, the paradisal kind Brits dream of all winter and habitually get on aeroplanes for. This old fishing town in western Cornwall has not one, but five of them, and on these pebble-free playgrounds you will find retro cafes and chi-chi, cocktail-shaking restaurants. It has utilitarian shops, too, selling buckets and spades and Tupperware, and fancy ones. You can buy jewellery and in one lifestyle boutique you can pick up anything from a nature book to a designer beanie.There is something for everyone on the food front, too. There are more than 110 places to eat in this far-flung spot. You’ve got seaside staples, including fish and chips, ice-cream, burgers and pasty outlets, some with a modern twist. Take the pasty, the miners’ lunchbox staple. The Cornish Bakery does a cosmopolitan Travelling Empanada and even a sweet potato and feta version. But thin-crust traditionalists can default to a cheese and onion from SH Ferell \u0026amp Son, the tiny family-run bakery on the corner of historic Fore Street.Ice-cream lovers can get a timeless 99 or organic clotted-cream concoctions from Moomaid of Zennor. Be warned, though. The seagulls are on to Moomaid. When I came out of the ice-cream shack with a double cone of Shipwreck (dulce de leche caramel and honeycomb, oh the bliss) one swooped down and had its beak in it before I could cry Daphne du Maurier. Kids, meanwhile, can go to a children’s theatre show, take a boat to see seals or a drop-in art workshop, or go on a ghost trail.Appealing, you might say, but no different to any other British seaside resort that combines nostalgia and stylish consumerism. I’m thinking of Rock, further east along the north Cornish coast, Southwold in Suffolk or Whitstable in Kent – just without the sandy beaches.But what no other seaside destination can match is the range of artistic and cultural offerings of St Ives, which is not a shrine to art but a dynamic, creative hub. We spotted real live artists drinking in the 16th-century Sloop Inn on the harbour after a hard day in the studio. Sand, surf and culture, that’s St Ives’s unique offering. Kids can get their bucket and spade fix and teenagers can sunbathe or surf.The curious or creative can throw a pot at the famous Leach Pottery or drop into a life-drawing class at the St Ives School of Painting. Or do what we did, and admire the work of St Ives artists, from Ben Nicholson to Naum Gabo and Patrick Heron their work is now on permanent display in the new Tate St Ives extension. Our trip was prompted by the Patrick Heron retrospective showing there. Heron is a sort of God in this westerly artists’ colony, and during our short visit my husband and I encountered him in all kinds of ways.Heron was all about intensity, sometimes joy and always colour. His paintings are an invitation to engage. “The picture is not the vehicle of meaning,” he once said, “the picture is the meaning.” Heron’s work is not hung chronologically in Tate St Ives, because, according to the curator Andrew Wilson, it was formally consistent. For the visitor, this is liberating: there is no pressure to be clever, or to spot the development of his artistic practice. Just enjoy the work, experience it, Wilson seems to be saying.There are many locals who seem touched by Heron’s zest for life. One of them, Tamsin Thompson, runs the SILCo Sea Rooms, an all-day tapas and cocktail and gastrobar that feels like a ship’s cabin. Sit up at the window seats overlooking the harbour, and you feel like you are on the prow of a ship. Thompson’s three sons are the local producers of the first-rate St Ives gin, served with a slice of grapefruit as a counterpoint to the sweet botanicals, including Bladderwrack, a local seaweed and a splendid word. Thompson is a contemporary of Heron’s daughters, who I met at the exhibition, and she used to play at Eagle’s Nest, Heron’s home for 40 years in the village of Zennor further along the West Penwith peninsula, as a child. He was always laughing, she tells me, and wore purple shirts.There was more colour in work by local artists hanging on the walls at Pedn Olva hotel, a retro gem with modern flourishes that presides from a granite rockface over St Ives Bay. It’s the place to go for a fresh lobster and prawn roll, or a sundowner in either the rooftop bar or the terrace bar. The views have fused into a single memory of diffused light and strips of sea-sky-sand. The views got me in a pickle. Our shower had a big window, also overlooking the Celtic sea which, each afternoon, was choppy. In the morning, it was crashing against the rocks. I spent a long time staring out of that window, which I could have spent eating more scones and Cornish clotted cream. It’s true what they say about the light here: it is soft, and mesmerising. It makes you yearn for something, and made me wish I could paint.But then we went to Barbara Hepworth’s studio, and I wished I could sculpt. There is a permanent installation of her monumental sculptures in the subtropical garden. One of the Heron daughters told me there is a new head gardener there, and that he has revived Hepworth’s original planting plans. The space is meditative and energising.It is impossible to get your fill of light and sky and sea in St Ives. The trick is to find different ways to experience it. One way is to ride the St Ives Bay Line that hugs the craggy coast. We took the broad gauge train for all of three-minutes from St Ives up the track to Carbis Bay, where we disembarked for the airy and stylish Boskerris Hotel. We toasted more light and sky and sea with a glass of wine on the luxe deck overlooking the Bay. Fortified, we walked back across the beach and down a winding, shaded path that hugged the coast to take those scones and clotted cream in the café overlooking Porthmeor beach. Surfers love it here. Sand-averse sybarites can repair to the buzzing Porthmeor beach café, which does interesting tapas and seafood and – a glam touch this – boasts heated eating pods complete with blanket for chilly knees.Walk on this beach, and you’ll want to keep walking, as we did, setting off on the South West Coast Path. It was a five-mile, reputedly demanding, walk to Zennor, where Heron lived until his death in 1999. I’d heard the name Zennor so many times by now, it had cast a sort of spell. There is a pub there, the Tinners Arms, recommended by an artist we met in Helston, a rather more self-effacing artists’ hub 30 miles inland, which is home to studios and a world-class initiative called CAST (Cornubian Arts and Science Trust) featuring international artists whose work is currently on show in erse and wonderful locations throughout Cornwall.We didn’t get to Zennor, because we had a talk to get to about Patrick Heron in Mousehole, a painting-perfect harbour town that is home to the Newlyn Art School. You can do art courses here, should you fancy it. There’s a pub called the Ship Inn, where, from the deck of the garden, you can admire the light, again. Then go back to St Ives and have a look at Heron’s “Mousehole, 1946”. His daughters told me that he only went to Mousehole once, and the fishing village didn’t have happy memories for him. But it made an impression, for personal reasons, as St Ives, and Heron, will on you. Accommodation provided by Pedn Olva (doubles from £215 per night) and at the Boskerris hotel (doubles from £160 per night). Patrick Heron is showing at Tate St Ives until 30 September. For art classes, see St Ives School of Painting and Newlyn School of Art. Groundwork, a series of exhibitions and events featuring international artists, takes places across Cornwall until September 2018 as part of CAST. See c-a-s-t.org.uk for venues.

I like the silly significance of it all, the talking points, the jokes, the drama, the new personalities that emerge as heroes or villains from each match…I enjoy it, except when England play. And this is not because Jesse Lingard scuffs the ball, or Raheem Sterling does a lot of running around and not a lot of scoring. It’s because of the commentary. Radio 5 Live’s usually excellent pundits, with their expert analysis and informed yet exasperated soundbites, somehow magically disappear, replaced by some rabid Engerland-bots banging on about missed opportunities and shoulda-been decisions, like overly proud parents watching their offspring in the school nativity. (“Why isn’t our Marcus playing Joseph? He’d drop the baby Jesus bang in the manger.”)It’s true that its commentators – John Murray and Chris Waddle in this instance – are better than those on TV, and in our house we often watch matches with the sound down and 5 Live up. But even then, when it comes to England, it’s horrible. Every single moment is skewed by nationalism and too-high expectations. “That was never a penalty. Should have been six goals, never mind two. And, Harry’s done it! He’s done it for St George!!…” Grr. Utterly painful listening. (Plus, why does everyone on the BBC insist on calling Dele, Dele Alli, when he’s said that he doesn’t want to use his surname as he’s estranged from his parents? The name on his shirt is Dele, so what is the problem? Everyone manages to call Ronaldo, Ronaldo…)Still, other than during England games, 5 Live has been doing well. Kelly Cates has been a great host, working both afternoons and on 606, and Mark “Chappers” Chapman is as enjoyable a listen as ever. Robbie Savage slightly drives me mad, but he’s only on for half an hour at 8.30am, and to be honest, driving people mad is Savage’s USP. He has his mum on for her predictions, which I like: “How are you, mother?” “I’m fine thank you poppet, how are you? I’m giving Portugal to win 4-0.”In search of non-BBC analysis and some more fun, I’ve tried a few football podcasts this week. One of the best, and certainly one of the most popular, is The Totally Football Show with James Richardson. Richardson was presenter of the ’s football podcast for several years. (The ’s football podcast, currently daily because of the World Cup, is still excellent without him, with Max Rushden taking over the hot seat.) Richardson’s new venture is a class act, smooth and fun. The pundits are on point without showing off, and interesting facts are woven into the show. It would be nice to get a few more women on there, but this is an excellent daily World Cup\u0026nbsppodcast.On The Game, from the Times, Natalie Sawyer presents, and thus far no listener has had a heart attack because of her woman-ness. It’s straightforward and informative, but there’s not many laffs. For those, try Top Flight Time Machine: World Cup. This features middle-aged white guys Sam Delaney and Andy Dawson going through past World Cups for stats and giggles. Doesn’t sound like much, but this is a warm and very funny show. The show about Italia 90, where they came up with a new England mascot, had me properly laughing. (The mascot was called Mr Sausage, if you want to know.) This podcast is like a post-football conversation with two witty friends – you never quite know where it’s going, but it will definitely find the joke.Another upbeat pals conversation is Touchline Fracas. With much younger and mostly non-white presenters, the chat and analysis is so swift and funny you sometimes struggle to keep up. I love it. And then there’s Mission to Moscow, which has YouTube star Hugh Wizzy reporting for TalkSport, a surprisingly sweet show. On the day of the England game, he just talked to fans before and after the match. Nice.Radio 3 Breakfast: Into the ForestiPlayerOn every breakfast show last week, and in other programmes on the network, Radio 3 was busy exploring “the enchantment, escape and magical danger of forests”. (How lovely does that sound?) In the mornings, Petroc Trelawny broadcast live from five different forests across the UK: one in Northern Ireland, one in Scotland, one in Wales and two in England. There were slow radio moments that simply featured the sounds from the woodland, plus live performances from beneath the trees. No arguing politicians allowed. Gorgeous.A Mile in My ShoesAcastEmpathy seems ever more essential in these troubled times, but did you know that there is an Empathy Museum? Established by philosopher Roman Krznaric in London in 2015, the museum created an art show called A Mile In My Shoes, which toured the world and has now been turned into a podcast by ace production company Loftus Media. Best listened to while actually walking, these short pieces invite you into other people’s experiences and lives. Listen to the tale of a woman working on a lifeboat on the Thames, of a man losing his mind in hospital and others.ZigzagRadiotopiaA show with the admirable aims of changing capitalism, journalism and the lives of women in tech, this new podcast from the Radiotopia stable showcases two creaky-voiced women who used to work at the WNYC tech show: Manoush Zomorodi, the presenter, and Jen Poyant, the producer. They’re now starting their own company and this podcast tells the tale. A mixture of recorded phone conversations, snippets of real-life chats and traditional tell-the-story presenting, Zigzag seems a little self-obsessed at first, but should get more exciting as it continues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6f8f84f3b597a73ca45ca8e7bb98c9808a9a258/0_14_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1004bfa06ba20d0d8c3fb69638fef72","title":"would you rent a flat from this guy meet stath lets flats fleabag bus rodent jamie demetrious clueless estate agent","story":"He was Bus Rodent, the creepy love interest in Fleabag. Now Jamie Demetriou has his own sitcom – about a wannabe wideboy in the grotty world of property. Will his ‘asexual innocent’ be a hit?A couple of years ago, Jamie Demetriou began getting a very strange response from the TV-watching public. “I had a lot of people asking me to open my mouth in the street,” says the comedian. “And it’s so difficult to make the connection. Because it’s not people going, ‘Are you in something?’ They just go, ‘Open your mouth.’ I’m like, ‘I don’t think I do that for strangers.’”The cause – and the reason Google tends to autocomplete searches for Demetriou with the word “teeth” – was his scene-stealing turn in Fleabag. He played a character known only as Bus Rodent, a creepy love interest for Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s heroine and a role that required him to don a massive pair of fake incisors. Even though the 30-year-old is still reeling from the show’s explosive popularity – “The scale is like One Direction, it’s mad” – if all goes to plan Bus Rodent will soon be superseded in the public consciousness. After five years of supplying his idiosyncratic and incredibly funny acting chops to Paddington 2, Sherlock Gnomes and a staggering number of British sitcoms, this week Demetriou debuts his own comedy vehicle.At a time when the London property market is a joke in itself, playing an estate agent hasn’t given Demetriou a respect for the profession. “It’s basically pointing at stuff and saying what it is,” he says. “Stath doesn’t have to do anything to let the flats. People have to live in shit flats, they just have to, because of the price of flats.” There’s something stubbornly English about Stath Lets Flats. “We wanted the whole thing to feel a bit grotty,” explains Demetriou. “‘Flat’ is an inherently British, mundane word – it’s onomatopoeia.” As his name and accent suggest, however, Stath has “a weird mixed identity ... he moved to England when he was about 12, and he was pinging between Greece and Cyprus as a kid.”While Stath is the perfect vehicle for his creator’s comic ticks – awkward intonation and malapropisms slang and the mangling of old-fashioned sayings – he’s more than a funny foreign caricature. Demetriou also has that Greek Cypriot heritage. “It was part of my identity that I didn’t really know what to do with, because stereotypes about that culture weren’t reflective of who I was,” he explains. Making the show “has reattached me to that culture in quite a nice way”.Stath’s eccentric father, Vasos (played by Christos Stergioglou of the cult film Dogtooth), is loosely based on Demetriou’s. The comic describes him as the “funniest singular thing in the world”, a man who went “on a march for Israeli women’s rights in France aged 67 because he met a guy in the gym who was really into it”. Demetriou is very proud of his father. “He moved to the UK when he was 13 with nothing, his dad just put him on a boat to send money back,” he says. “He didn’t have any shoes to begin with, and he worked himself up to be a top chef.”Stath Lets Flats is a family affair in another sense: the hero’s sweetly idiotic sister Sophie is played by his real-life sibling, Natasia. She, Jamie and the comic actor Ellie White frequently collaborate with the sketch group Sheeps – AKA Liam Williams, Al Roberts and Daran Johnson. In Williams’ YouTuber-parody Pls Like, Demetriou was pitch-perfect as wet-wipe-flogging grime MC Bombzy in Stath Lets Flats, Roberts plays an extremely mild-mannered fellow lettings agent whom Stath worships. When, in 2016, the six created the wacky web series Year Friends, it cemented them as the thrilling alternative comedy gang of their day.That said, these days, even the funniest young comics aren’t guaranteed TV stardom. Stath has taken six years to reach sitcom status. The character first appeared in 2013 as part of Channel 4’s online “comedy blaps”, where he caught the attention of Friday Night Dinner creator Robert Popper. “I remember him asking, ‘What do you want to make?’, and I was like, ‘I’d quite like to do something where I’m singing.’ It was over quite quickly after that.” Since Popper co-wrote Stath Lets Flats, he clearly wasn’t too put off by Demetriou’s left-field suggestions – but the comic is relentlessly self-effacing. He’s recently worked with Julia Davis and guested on the new Alan Partridge series. “If you’re opposite them and they’re not going, ‘Who the fuck is this piece of shit?’, you’re like, oh my God!” he says.Yet even with no comedy giants in the vicinity, the actor will find something to panic about. When we meet, his producer has just shown his children Stath Lets Flats and Demetriou frets that he has unintentionally created a character for pre-schoolers. “I worry that because Stath is such an asexual innocent, it really does appeal to five-year-olds,” he says, brow furrowed. “He says silly things like, ‘Oh my gilly goodness.’ Have I accidentally made a CBBC show? There’s a guy running around chasing a pigeon.”With those anxieties just about quelled, he is now looking forward to showing the world the finished product. “The fact that I don’t think it’s diabolical is a huge achievement for me,” says Demetriou, who nowadays is starting to feel more secure in his insecurities. “I don’t want to get out of my anxiety, because everyone I see who is making stuff that I like is an absolute mess, and I don’t think there’s any coincidence.” If he’s right, there’s little doubt British comedy will benefit from Demetriou remaining a quivering wreck as long as he possibly can.Stath Lets Flats is on Channel 4 on 27 June, 10pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd84e2e39b4ac5870c61a1ab52055bd6cbfb7517/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10472673534ba47aa11bdcedb6d38955","title":"pacific hymns the definitive hipster playlist","story":"Seattle, Portland and San Fran aren’t just cities – they’re states of mind, man. So if you’re looking for counterculture sounds, it’s here you’ll find songs that spoke for a generationImmersion in Seattle’s music scene begins minutes after disembarking at Sea-Tac, the city’s international airport, which houses a store devoted to the record company Sub Pop. In 1988, the then shoestring Sub Pop Records released Nirvana’s debut single it subsequently became as synonymous with Seattle as Motown is with Detroit. Opening our hipster playlist is Nirvana’s fourth single, Smells Like Teen Spirit, released three years later. It became a massive hit across the world, igniting the rock phenomenon that would transform Seattle, a hitherto obscure enclave in America’s far north-west, into an epicentre of cool.Previous generations of Seattle musicians took for granted that they would have to leave their hometown if they wanted a successful career. Arguably the greatest electric guitarist of all-time, Jimi Hendrix is up next – he was born and raised in Seattle, although only found fame after moving to London.Right now, Seattle’s music has never been so rich or erse. Witness the contrast of Fleet Foxes’ Sun it Rises, a yearning choral-Americana hymn to frontier spirits, with avant-hip-hop duo Shabazz Palaces. Shine a Light hails from their futuristic twin Quazarz album – released in 2017 by a certain indie record label with its own airport shop.Portland has become renowned in recent years for its ultra-progressive attitudes – as satirised by the comedy series Portlandia – but the city’s hippy roots have long attracted free-thinkers from all over America. Emerging from the city’s early 90s underground rock scene with his disarmingly catchy dark-folk confessionals was Elliott Smith. Here, we trace the Texan native’s troubled quest around Portland in Needle in the Hay.Other musicians who rocked up in Portland included feminist trio Sleater-Kinney, formed in the Washington state capital Olympia during the mid-90s, by guitarists Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein, alongside drummer Janet Weiss. From their 2015 comeback album, No Cities to Love confounds the adage that radical voices mellow with age – or, in the case of Portlandia co-creator Brownstein, fame.Next up, we have the Shins, who formed in New Mexico but became Portland residents following their 2002 breakthrough hit New Slang (as featured in the film Garden State). Then, Laura Veirs – who was called to the city via Colorado and the midwest to craft her contemplative modern-folk tapestries – offers a revelatory version of the Grateful Dead song Mountains of the Moon, from her latest album the Lookout.The Grateful Dead were, of course, a flagship band for 60s counterculture. From San Fran, tremors from the Summer of Love rippled up the west coast of the US – and then around the world. While the Dead were busy soundtracking Ken Kesey’s Acid Tests, the 1967 Haight-Ashbury scene’s commercial powerhouse was Jefferson Airplane, a relatively straightforward folk-rock band until the recruitment of siren vocalist Grace Slick. Her vocals on White Rabbit – with its exhortation to “feed your head” – alongside other songs, such as Somebody to Love, helped the tracks become anthems for the ages.A decade later, the punk revolution was under way, and San Francisco’s North Beach district harboured the latest manifestation of the city’s nonconformist heritage: the Dead Kennedys. They deployed caustic satire in songs like California Über Alles to debunk mainstream American culture and politics.Our penultimate track is Why Won’t You Stay, by one of San Francisco’s greatest songwriters, Mark Eitzel, chronicler of the city’s luckless and heartbroken for the past 30 years – both with legendary band American Music Club, notably on Everclear (Rolling Stone’s Best Album of 1991), and in his more recent solo work. Eitzel’s lachrymose voice is the perfect accompaniment to a Mission bar crawl.Carrying the city’s freak flag proudly into the present day to round off our playlist are Thee Oh Sees, a twin-drummer psychedelic juggernaut led by wild-eyed John Dwyer – proof that San Fran isn’t merely a place, it’s also a state of mind.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68108e93bbebe259ff0afab54bba744bff548de2/49_54_6231_3738/master/6231.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=faebb9c6d1be7bddbf2737d2f674bbf2","title":"england cathedrals back to middle ages mystery plays pageants chester st albans","story":"Pilgrimages, pageants and a revival of the Mystery Plays aim to attract interest and precious fundsFor centuries they have been places of quiet reflection, highbrow music and greyish stone. But now cathedrals are transforming their genteel image with bright colour, noisy processions and drama, reviving long-abandoned practices from the middle ages and drawing in the crowds.Leading the pack in this medieval comeback is St Albans Cathedral in Hertfordshire which on Saturday attracted thousands to its pilgrimage to mark the feast day of Saint Alban, the first Christian martyred in Britain. And on Wednesday the Chester Mystery Plays will be performed in the nave of Chester Cathedral, the original cycle of 24 plays condensed into one by old soap-opera hands for an 18-day run.Jeffrey John, the dean of St Albans who created the modern-day pilgrimage, said: “We have returned to a very visual culture today and medieval practices suit that. And if you have strong medieval roots as so many cathedrals do, you are bound to probe them and revive that heritage.”Medieval pilgrims flocked to St Albans Cathedral (the site of a Benedictine monastery founded by King Offa of Mercia in AD793) because it housed the bones of Saint Alban until the shrine was dismantled after the Reformation. Now the cathedral has revived the pilgrimage, which winds its way through the town to tell the 1,700-year-old story of the martyr using 12-foot-high puppets, made by a company that creates floats for the Notting Hill Carnival.The puppets include not only Saint Alban himself but also Roman soldiers, lions and charioteers. As well as hundreds of local people taking part, the pilgrimage of drama and prayers attracts thousands from across Britain.The revival of practices abandoned because of the Reformation and Puritan influence is highly appealing to many Anglican cathedral deans facing huge costs to keep their ancient buildings in good order. At next month’s General Synod, the Church of England will discuss a report from the Cathedrals Working Group about financial management of cathedrals and to urge the government to establish a cathedral fabric fund to support conservation and restoration programmes.The acting dean of Chester Cathedral, Jane Brooke, agrees with John that medieval practices work in the 21st century because of the dominance of visual culture. Created for a mostly illiterate population, the Mystery Plays were first revived for the Festival of Britain and have been performed at intervals since – but have only just been welcomed into the cathedral.“During the middle ages very few people, apart from the priests, knew the Bible story so it was a mystery, hence Mystery Plays,” said Brooke.“Now they are a way in for people who do not know the Christian story so well today. It is a very big thing for us to have the plays in the cathedral and we are moving times of services to accommodate them.”The Chester Mystery Plays is being brought to the public by director Peter Leslie Wild, who has directed episodes of The Archers, and playwright Deborah McAndrew, who was a regular in Coronation Street for eight years.“We have to assume no prior knowledge of Christianity,” said Wild. “This is an interpretation for a modern audience, rooted in contemporary life and performed by local people, just as they would have been in the middle ages”.One new twist in this year’s plays is the focus on the destruction of God’s creation by humanity, with the stage awash with plastic following the flood, when Noah saves animals in his ark.Other cathedrals and their cities are also seeking inspiration from the medieval era. At Lincoln Cathedral, which is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, Catholic practices have been revived that were abandoned during the Reformation, with processions to Mary’s statue on her feast days. In Canterbury, a medieval pageant is planned for 7 July to commemorate the penitential pilgrimage of Henry II in 1174 when he made reparation for inciting the murder of Thomas Becket, the archbishop of Canterbury. Chocolate medallions are given to young pilgrims if they visit five sites in the city – sugary replicas of the badges awarded to weary medieval travellers when they reached Canterbury."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d9679e5048e5bc9c0ef1d5dc109c79aecd3fa3d/0_16_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c16bb8958493105bfc77083c8dacce70","title":"saudi arabia aseel al hamad formula one car le castellet","story":"Aseel Al Hamad took a lap of Le Castellet circuit ahead of French Grand PrixAseel Al Hamad made a further breakthrough for Saudi Arabian women by driving a Formula One car ahead of the French Grand Prix. The lap of the Le Castellet circuit came on the day a ban ended on women driving on the Gulf kingdom’s roads.Hamad drove a 2012 Renault car as part of a parade of the French manufacturer’s vehicles to mark the return of the race after a 10-year absence. The same Lotus Renault E20 car took Finland’s 2007 world champion, Kimi Raikkonen, to victory in Abu Dhabi in 2012.“I believe today is not just celebrating the new era of women starting to drive, it’s also the birth of women in motor sport in Saudi Arabia,” Hamad told Reuters.Hamad is the first female member of the Saudi Arabian Motorsport Federation and on the Women in Motorsport Commission (WMC) set up by Formula One’s governing body, the International Automobile Federation (FIA). She first drove the E20 on a training day on 5 June at the circuit. “I have loved racing and motor sport from a very young age and to drive a Formula One car goes even beyond my dreams and what I thought was possible,” she said. “I hope doing so on the day when women can drive on the roads in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia shows what you can do if you have the passion and spirit to dream.” Michèle Mouton, a former rally driver and president of the WMC, said she hoped Hamad’s example would help pave the way for more women to embrace careers in motor sport. Women in Saudi Arabia were able to take to the roads at midnight on Saturday, ending the world’s last ban on female drivers, long seen as an emblem of women’s repression in the deeply conservative Muslim kingdom. The lifting of the ban, ordered last September by King Salman, is part of sweeping reforms pushed by his powerful young son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in a bid to transform the economy of the world’s top oil exporter and open up its cloistered society."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c81accf593ceab78afc28a458d28f2853737c7a0/0_209_3907_2344/master/3907.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=718b68174d0170d233311909a36c19c1","title":"zsa zsa english bulldog wins worlds ugliest dog competition in pictures","story":"English Bulldog wins competition in Petaluma, near San Francisco, California.

The agency said the foreigners, who include three French citizens in eastern Agri province and three Germans and four Italians in the southeastern provinces of Sirnak, Batman and Diyarbakir, tried to “interfere” in the elections by posing as accredited observers. The Agri governor’s office said the French nationals were speaking to voters regarding the elections but were not on the official OSCE accredited monitor list. They were brought to law enforcement to be “interviewed”.The French Communist party said a Communist senator, Christine Prunaud, was among those detained. “Turkish authorities want to snuff out any criticism of the massive fraud underway,” the party said in a statement.Kareem Shaheen reports from the Cihangir polling station he visited this afternoon:In the liberal neighbourhood of Cihangir, voters said they were there to cast their vote against what they described as one-man rule. They said they were happy to take part in a democratic tradition in what may be the most important election in their lifetime.Fulya, a 39 year old voter with breathing difficulties who cast her ballot while her friend carried her oxygen tank, said she was against the new extraordinary presidential powers that President Erdoğan will wield if he wins, and which were narrowly approved in a referendum last year.Her friend Hakan, 45, said he was there to vote “against tyranny.” “For almost 10 years I was not optimistic,” he added. “This is the first time.”Resit, a 93 year old man, visited the voting centre with his daughter holding his arm as he descended the stairs to the polling station to vote for opposition candidate Muharrem Ince. “It is our duty to vote,” they said. Seyda, a 38 year old voter, didn’t say who she would vote for but brought her 6 year old to witness the scene. “They are the future of this country,” she said. “Everything isn’t a rose garden, they have to see the reality.”In early reports of isolated election violence, four people appear to have been killed in the province of Erzurum in a fight at a polling station, Kareem Shaheen reports, including the local head of the nationalist Iyi party and other cadres. The deaths were confirmed by Mustafa Guldogan, a party official.Four people have also been arrested in Suruc over vote-rigging allegations. The CHP party of Erdogan’s main presidential challenger, Muharrem Ince, said party officials had confirmed cases of inconsistencies in the Sanliurfa province.“From Sanliurfa, there have been many complaints,” spokesman Bulent Tezcan told reporters in Ankara. “Our colleagues intervened where (the issues) occurred.” He said complaints had been made to neighbourhood election committee and officials had approached the Higher Election Board (YSK).It is just past 5pm in Turkey and polls have closed in the country’s snap parliamentary and presidential elections.Counting will now get underway. The electoral commission bans any reporting on the count until 9pm local time to make sure that voting in every polling station is well and truly finished, but it can – and almost invariably does – bring that time forward once it is sure everyone who queued to vote has cast their ballot. Kareem Shaheen has been tweeting some evocative pictures of voters he spoke to at an polling station in Cihangir, Istanbul as polls draw to close:Polls close in about 10 minutes. Votes in the country’s 188,000 ballot boxes will then be counted, inidually and aloud and in the presence of observers, before an official declaration for that box is drawn up and witnessed. The boxes are then resealed, with the ballots inside, and carried to regional counting centres where they are repoened, reocunted, and the results fed into the electoral commission’s computer system.The fact that voters are casting their ballots in two elections is inevitably likely to slow the process, but initial results are nonetheless expected within three to four hours and an official outcome before midnight.Turnout for the dual high-stakes election is forecast to be exceptionally high. Anecdotal evidence seems to be bearing that out:The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has deployed 22 long-term and 350 short-term observers for the elections amid fears among opposition leaders that recent changes to electoral procedures could lead to voter fraud.Peter Osusky, head of monitoring delegation, told AP all observers “are strongly adhering to so-called code of conduct” regardless of their political opinions.Turkey has nonetheless denied entry to Andrej Hunko of Germany’s Left Party and Jabar Amin of Sweden’s small Environment Party “based on their publicly expressed political opinion”, he said.Turks abroad are expected to leave their mark on the elections this year, with an unprecedented 1.49 million voters casting their ballots over a 13 day period earlier this month, Kareem Shaheen reports.Turnout for Turks in Europe in particular is crucial for the president, who commands great support among the diaspora there.Erdoğan and the AKP, however, were barred from conducting rallies in European countries like Germany, Austria and the Netherlands with large Turkish populations. Before last year’s referendum, both sides exchanged vitriolic insults and relations between Ankara and the EU have been generally miserable for years.Erdoğan was able to conduct one rally in Sarajevo that was attended by Turks living in other parts of Europe.Some Kurdish villagers are having to walk a considerable distance to cast their ballots at polling stations that the government says have had to be relocated for security reasons – but they seem prepared to make the effort. Citing security, authorities moved and merged thousands of ballot boxes in Kurdish areas, affecting some 144,000 voters and forcing many to cross military checkpoints to reach polling stations.Growing allegations of election fraud are emerging from Sanliurfa, particularly the town of Suruc and nearby villages, Kareem Shaheen reports. These include attempts to stuff ballots, voters casting ballots on behalf of relatives and women, open voting and intimidation. Election observers with the opposition have been evicted from polling centres as well.Suruc was the scene of the only deadly incident in the run up to the election, when four people were killed - local shop owners and relatives of a ruling party MP. Urfa has a large Kurdish population and has generally voted for Erdoğan’s AKP, but the HDP made inroads there in recent elections.’s Istanbul correspondent, Kareem Shaheen, is at one of the polling stations in Kasimpasa, the Istanbul neighborhood where President Erdoğan grew up.“I voted for Tayyip Erdoğan,” said Yaşar Ayhan, 52, a former barber of the president when he was mayor of Istanbul. “We are proud of him. He’s not only a leader, but a world leader.”Supporters of the president have often pointed to his championing of Muslim causes, such as Jerusalem and the opposition in Syria, as one of the reasons why they admire his role on the global stage.“He delivers on what he says, and is trustworthy and just,” said Ayhan. “He is gentle but tough on the enemies of Turkey.”Recep, a 37 year old voter, said he also voted for President Erdoğan because the Turkish leader hailed from the same district as he did, but he cast his vote in the parliamentary elections for the Islamist Saadet party, which has campaigned strongly on fixing the economy.“I believe AKP parliamentarians aren’t efficient because of corruption,” he said.When president Erdoğan called for early elections, many observers believed he did it to preempt an economic slump in the coming months. Mismanagement of the economy, amid worries of overheating, a widening foreign trade deficit and the rapid fall in value of the Turkish lira were a backdrop to the vote run-up.And don’t forget the country remains in a state of emergency introduced after a failed coup against Erdoğan’s regime in July 2016 that has seen 107,000 public servants and soldiers sacked and more than 50,000 people have been imprisoned pending trial.In a field of six candidates, he faces unexpectedly stiff opposition from former physics teacher Muharrem Ince of the social democrat Republican People’s party (CHP), who could prove a real threat in an eventual run-off on 6 July.If he is re-elected, however, Erdoğan’s hold on power will be greatly enhanced. Last year’s referendum transformed Turkey’s parliamentary system of government into an executive presidency presidency, with the position of prime minister abolished and the head of state able to directly appoint top public officials, including ministers, and intervene in the legal system.“Some of the most developed countries have a turnout of only around 30 percent,” he said, adding modestly that Turkey’s transition to an executive presidency system would raise the country “beyond the level of contemporary civilisations”.He said he planned to watch the early results announcements in Istanbul before moving on to Ankara at the end of the evening.Good afternoon and welcome to the ’s live coverage of Turkey’s historic, high-stakes snap double election to decide both the presidency and the parliament. More than 59 million Turkish voters have been voting since 6am this morning at over 180,000 polling stations that will close in about an hour’s time. The results, expected later today, could – assuming he wins the presidential poll –dramatically strengthen Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s hold on power, giving him sweeping new executive powers approved in a referendum last year.But if his ruling Islamist-rooted Justice and Development party (AKP) loses its majority in parliament, Erdoğan – a former mayor of Istanbul who has never been defeated in an election – could find his political ambitions significantly curtailed.

Photograph: Dublin Fire BrigadeGorse fires continue to rage across south Dublin and Wicklow as temperatures rise across the country.Dublin Fire Service said on Sunday gorse fires were taking hold “all over” as the service attempts to douse them while temperatures continue to rise and land dries out.A Department of Agriculture orange warning for fire will remain in place until Thursday because of the ongoing dry and warm weather unless there is significant rainfall.But Met Éireann predicts dry, warm weather until the weekend, when advancing weather systems are likely to have an impact because of a weakening of high pressure.The highest temperature recorded at 1pm today was 23.5 degrees at Casement Aerodrome but meteorologist Klara Finkele said temperatures would increase further in the afternoon with up to 26 degrees expected in parts of the country.The hottest weather of the year to date was reached on June 7th when temperatures soared to 26.1 degrees in Shannon and 25.8 degrees in Mount Dillon, Mayo.Temperatures hit 22.5 degrees on Sunday in Gurteen, Co Tipperary and 23 degrees in Oak Park, in Carlow.Temperatures are expected to reach 28 degrees on Tuesday in parts of the country. The high pressure keeping the warm weather in place is expected to weaken at the weekend and cloud between Ireland and Iceland is expected to affect Irish weather.The Irish Cancer Society has appealed to people to take proper precautions to avoid sunburn and the increased risk of skin cancer. Most skin cancer in Ireland is as a result of over exposure to the sun.The society advises that “whatever the weather from April to September protect your skin” and seek shade, wear shirts with a collar and three-quarter length sleeves and three quarter length trousers.The society also urges people to use sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 and a broad-brimmed hat.As fire fighters continue to deal with gorse fires, Dublin Fire Brigade said it had difficulty accessing a large forest fire yesterday because of poor parking by motorists.The fire service tweeted a photo of a fire engine blocked by a car from the entrance to a forest by a motorist out and appealed to motorists about today to “park sensibly”.Firefighters continued to deal with fires at Saggart, Co Dublin and at Puck’s Castle, Barnaslingan.Irish Water said recent dry spells demand for water increases by between 20 million and 30 million litres a day which reaches and has exceeded the maximum capacity.But the authority said that “current storage in the raw water reservoirs in the Greater Dublin Area, at Roundwood (Vartry) and Pollaphuca (Liffey) are reasonable and we do not see shortages at present. If the Summer and Autumn continues dry and hot, they may come under pressure later in the year.”The Dublin region is currently using around 600 million litres of water a day which is close to the maximum level of water that can treated on a daily basis. The authority said that “if supply consistently meets or exceeds demand there may be water outages in the Greater Dublin Area as Irish Water manages the network and tries to minimize the impact on homes and businesses”.The company’s drought management group is assessing supplies at risk which include the midlands, particularly Athlone and Mullingar, parts of Offaly, Kilkenny, parts of Donegal and the Greater Dublin Area where demand for treated water is regularly almost as great as supply.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3541942.1529849588!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"president pays tribute to irish peacekeepers on 60th anniversary of missions abroad","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident Michael D Higgins at a ceremony to celebrate Ireland’s service and commitment to UN peacekeeping. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe President Michael D Higgins has paid tribute to Irish peacekeepers, including the 87 who lost their lives on missions abroad, at a ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of their work in conflict zones. Mr Higgins was greeted at the formal event in the upper courtyard of Dublin Castle on Sunday by retired Col John Ryan, who served in Lebanon in 1958. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Minister of State for Defence Paul Kehoe and Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan were also in attendance. In his speech to an invited audience, including the family members of peacekeepers, Mr Higgins acknowledged the “professionalism, the bravery, and the commitment to peace and humanitarianism” that he said lay at the core of their engagement as peacekeepers. In 1958, three years after Ireland gained membership of the United Nations Organisation, 50 Irish officers were deployed to the United Nations Observer Group in Lebanon (UNOGIL).They were tasked with ensuring that there was no illegal infiltration of personnel, or the supply of arms, or other material across the border between Lebanon and Syria.Mr Higgins noted Irish Defence Forces personnel had served in peace support missions in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and South America, completing over 66,700 tours of duty.He said our participation in UN and UN-mandated peacekeeping missions was “a tangible demonstration of Ireland’s commitment to the pursuit of international peace”. “Since June 1958, members of the Defence Forces have manned observation posts, stood guard or patrolled a zone of separation, somewhere within the world’s most volatile places. This is a unique record and one of which the Defence Forces and the Irish people can be justifiably very proud,” he added. There are currently 637 members of the Defence Forces serving overseas on nine different missions. “For these Irish men and women, service with the United Nations is rightly regarded as noble and important. The effectiveness of the United Nations depends on its reputation as a force, for peace, for good, in the world. Ireland’s participation in UN and UN-mandated missions illustrate the very positive and practical difference that small countries, like Ireland, can make in the world’s conflict zones,” Mr Higgins said. He said Ireland’s peacekeeping reputation had always been “strongly predicated on our neutrality”.“As members of the UN we are committed to maintaining international peace and security. Our position as an independent and neutral state has been greatly valuable in enabling us to deliver on that commitment. It has established our acceptability as peacemakers, and peace defenders and has thus enabled us to play an effective role in the international community,” he said. Mr Higgins also paid tribute to “the significant role played by women in peacekeeping missions in conflict prevention, conflict resolution and peace building”.“Since 1982 our most talented women have joined their male colleagues in serving in the Defence Forces overseas. Over 300 women have served overseas since 1982 and currently there are 29 women serving overseas,” he said. He said the promotion of a strong gender perspective was “a key element in all peacekeeping operations” and that it must continue to be a priority to increase female participation in peacekeeping contingents.The president noted 86 members of the Defence Forces and a member of An Garda Síochána had lost their lives on overseas peacekeeping missions. “Behind that stark figure lies, of course, so much lost potential and so many families ruptured and bereaved. Our thoughts and prayers are also with those peacekeepers and their families today,” he said.

Photograph:  Srdjan SukiEPAAnyone driving the streets, highways and byways of Istanbul in recent days would be led to believe there’s just one candidate standing in Turkey’s presidential election on Sunday: the incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Erdogan’s face appears on posters hanging from bridges, on the sides of five-storey buildings and, most commonly, on almost every inch of available billboard space. “Turkey wants a big, strong leader,” goes the caption accompanying his posters.On a 45-minute drive through the Anatolian districts of this metropolis of 15 million people, the only sign that there are others in the race is a single billboard for Muharrem Ince, the opposition CHP presidential candidate. Switch on television, and there Erdogan is again: relaying in detail to a pair of meek interviewers how life was desperate for Turks in the 1990s, before the AK Party he leads came to power.With five elections and referendum campaigns held over the past five years, Turks are no strangers to going to the polls. But what’s different ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections on Sunday is that Turkey’s future is now clearly about one man. Never mind that Erdogan’s opponents don’t get a look-in there are almost no references to the AK Party itself, a party that has transformed socio-economic life across the country, nor its candidates standing for election in these very localities.In its 15 years in power, the AK Party under Erdogan has overcome an attempted military coup, a basket case economy and waves of Islamic State and Kurdish terrorist attacks. It has also transformed countless cities, towns and districts, improving the day-to-day lives of tens of millions of people.The residential district of Uskudar on Istanbul’s Asian shore has perhaps benefited more than others. For a long time, it represented the worst of modern city life: clogged, narrow streets, poor electricity and water access, and endless blocks of dreary apartment buildings.“Uskudar has changed a lot since the 1990s, both physically and demographically. For example, we use natural gas now, it wasn’t there in the 1990s,” says Aylin Ornek, a resident. “Besides the construction facilities, it has become the main transporting point of Istanbul, and this made Uskudar more attractive for people to live here. As I see it, the population is not as conservative as before.”The building of an €80 million mosque – Turkey’s largest – a state-of-the-art driverless metro line and a soon-to-be-opened 365m-high TV tower complete with restaurants and viewing deck have turned Uskudar into a thriving hub.But on Sunday Erdogan faces major challenges. For the first time, Turkey’s opposition is united. Two new faces in Muharrem Ince and IYI Party leader Meral Aksener are out to halt the president’s increasingly vice-like grip on the country. The parties and others have formed the so-called “Nation Alliance”, which hopes to take away the AK Party’s parliamentary majority and reinstate a system in which Turkey’s 600 MPs debate over and make laws.An Erdogan victory would usher in a new executive presidency in which the role of prime minister would be abolished.It is Ince in particular who stands as Erdogan’s main threat. The fiery former physics teacher has courted Kurds by campaigning in Diyarbakir, the largest Kurdish-inhabited city in Turkey, and visiting Selahattin Demirtas, the imprisoned former co-leader of the Kurdish-focussed HDP (and who is also running for president) – previously unthinkable moves for a staunchly nationalist party. Ince drew hundreds of thousands of supporters to a rally in Izmir on Thursday, which was reported to be one of the biggest opposition gatherings in years. He has also repeatedly challenged Erdogan to a TV debate but the president has always refused.How the election plays out for the HDP is of particular concern to the AK Party as it tries to maintain its parliamentary majority. Only parties that win 10 per cent or more of the popular vote can enter parliament, and should the HDP reach this threshold, the AK Party’s majority would almost certainly end.Tellingly, the long-standing notion that Erdogan represents for the West a crucial partner in a neighbourhood where countries such as Syria and Iraq have been traumatised by conflict is beginning to slip.“Should Erdogan emerge electorally victorious but politically weaker with a narrow electoral margin – a real possibility – tensions with the West would put him at greater risk of Russian manipulation against Nato, ” wrote Marc Pierini of Carnegie Europe, a think tank, this week.“Most polls predict that Erdogan will carry the presidency. In that event, liberties and tolerance in Turkey’s erse society would fall even further, followed by Turkey’s alliance with the West.”There has never been a better chance for Turkey’s opposition. Under the AK Party, unemployment and inflation have languished in double figures for several years. The opposition CHP, long considered out of touch with people, has been revitalised since a “justice march” from Ankara to Istanbul last summer drew together millions of Erdogan opponents.If the opposition Nation Alliance can deny the AK Party and its nationalist backers, the MHP, a majority in parliament, and if Erdogan is forced into a run-off vote (if he fails to win more than 50 per cent of the vote), the aura of invincibility that has surrounded him may begin to recede.And yet, when the AK Party has been troubled in the past, it has come back stronger. When it lost its parliamentary majority in an election in June 2015, it was able to pivot its stance from conservative Islamism to a fervent anti-Kurdish nationalism that saw it regain control of parliament.What’s different this time, however, is that by many accounts the Turkish economy appears headed for a period of crisis – a fact many link to Erdogan’s decision to call this election a year and a half ahead of schedule."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3541864.1529822133!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"turks head to the polls in crucial test for erdogan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA man casts his ballot for Turkey’s presidential and parliamentary elections at a polling station in Ankara. Photograph: Stoyan NenovReuters  Turks began voting on Sunday for a new president and parliament in elections that pose the biggest challenge to Tayyip Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted AK Party since they swept to power more than a decade and a half ago.The elections will also usher in a powerful new executive presidency long sought by Mr Erdogan and backed by a small majority of Turks in a 2017 referendum. Critics say it will further erode democracy in the Nato member state and entrench one-man rule.More than 56 million people were registered to vote at 180,000 ballot boxes across Turkey. Voting began at 8 am (5am GMT) and will end at 5pm (2pm GMT).Mr Erdogan, the most popular but also isive leader in modern Turkish history, moved the elections forward from November 2019, arguing the new powers would better enable him to tackle the nation’s mounting economic problems - the lira has lost 20 per cent against the dollar this year - and deal with Kurdish rebels in southeast Turkey and in neighbouring Iraq and Syria. But he reckoned without Muharrem Ince, the presidential candidate of the secularist Republican People’s Party (CHP), whose feisty performance at campaign rallies has galvanised Turkey’s long-demoralised and ided opposition.Addressing a rally in Istanbul on Saturday attended by hundreds of thousands of people, Mr Ince promised to reverse what he and opposition parties see as a swing towards authoritarian rule under Mr Erdogan in the country of 81 million people.“If Erdogan wins, your phones will continue to be listened to ... Fear will continue to reign ... If Ince wins, the courts will be independent,” said Mr Ince, adding he would lift Turkey’s state of emergency within 48 hours of being elected.Turkey has been under emergency rule - which restricts some personal freedoms and allows the government to bypass parliament with emergency decrees - for nearly two years following an abortive military coup in July 2016.Erdogan blamed the coup on his former ally, US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, and has waged a sweeping crackdown on the preacher’s followers in Turkey. The United Nations say some 160,000 people have been detained and nearly as many more, including teachers, judges and soldiers, sacked.The president’s critics, including the European Union which Turkey still nominally aspires to join, say Mr Erdogan has used the crackdown to stifle dissent. Few newspapers or other media openly criticise the government and he has received far more election coverage than other presidential candidates.Mr Erdogan, who defends his tough measures as essential for national security, told his supporters at rallies on Saturday that if re-elected he would press ahead with more of the big infrastructure projects that have helped turn Turkey into one of the world’s fastest-growing economies during his time in office.“If he wins, I think the obstacles before us will disappear and we will have control,” said Nesrin Cuha (37) a call centre worker, who wore a headscarf. Religiously observant Muslims form the bedrock of Mr Erdogan’s support.“The opposition will not be a nuisance anymore with the new presidential system,” said another Erdogan supporter, retired sailor Engin Ozmen (60).Polls show Mr Erdogan falling short of a first-round victory in the presidential race but he would be expected to win a run-off on July 8th, while his AK Party could lose its parliamentary majority, possibly heralding increased tensions between president and parliament.Other presidential candidates include Selahattin Demirtas, leader of the pro-Kurdish Peoples Democratic Party (HDP), who is now in jail on terrorism-related charges that he denies. If the HDP exceeds the 10 percent threshold of votes needed to enter parliament, it will be harder for the AKP to get a majority.In a final appeal for votes in a video clip from his high security prison, Demirtas said: “If the HDP fails to get into parliament, all Turkey will lose. Backing the HDP means supporting democracy.”–Reuters "},{"url":null,"title":"summer solstice 2018 longest day pictures","story":"The spectacular moment the sun begins to rise over Stonehenge, Wiltshire this morning as Britain welcomes the longest day of the year. The monument is built along the solstice alignment of the summer sunrise and the winter sunset. Read more about the summer solstice here.How a discarded restaurant napkin led to an arrest in the 32-year-old cold case of a murdered US schoolgirlPierce Brosnan endorses Tom Hardy as the next James BondRoseanne Barr apologises for racist tweet during tearful first interview since her sitcom was cancelledComment: Universities churn out graduates of dubious quality who infect society with disappointment.

Sleep deprived, but really well, she said.Ms Ardern, 37, became New Zealand\u0027s youngest prime minister when she took office through a coalition deal last year after an inconclusive election. She has now become the first woman in the country\u0027s history to give birth while in office.She delivered her 3.31 kg (7.3 lb) daughter in the country\u0027s largest public hospital on Thursday afternoon with her partner, television presenter Clarke Gayford, at her side.Baby Neve sleeps through all the fussThe couple had settled on the baby\u0027s first name, Neve, after she was born, her mother said, explaining that it means bright and radiant and snow, which reflected that she was born in the middle of winter during the nation\u0027s indigenous Maori new year and the shortest day of the year.Her second name, Te Aroha, which means love in Te Reo Maori, one of the country\u0027s national languages, was a nod to the many Maori iwi, or tribes, that had offered names as a gift to Ms Ardern while she was pregnant.\u0027Te Aroha\u0027 was our way of reflecting the amount of love this baby has been shown even before she arrived, Ms Ardern said.The island nation, with a population of 4.5 million, was in the grips of a baby-induced glow of optimism in recent days with many social media users dubbing the baby the Prime Miniature while they waited for her name to be announced.It\u0027s just something really lovely in a world where so much is unfair that we\u0027re all very excited about it, said Frances Gerbic, a music teacher living in Auckland.Proud mum and dad speak to the mediaThe New Zealand Symphony Orchestra recorded a version of Brahm\u0027s lullaby Cradle Song translated into Te Reo Maori, and Auckland\u0027s tallest building, the Sky Tower, was lit up pink for three nights in honour of the occasion.Support also flooded in from around the world, with Britain\u0027s Queen Elizabeth, whom Ms Ardern met in London in April, sending an emailed message of congratulations and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeting at Ms Ardern: Pro tip, Jacinda: Briefing notes make excellent bed time stories.Ms Ardern will take the next six weeks off, leaving her deputy Winston Peters in charge, and return to work in early August when Mr Gayford will care for the baby full-time.Meet New Zealand\u0026#039s \u0026#039First Bloke\u0026#039: Clarke Gayford, the man who\u0026#039ll become a stay-at-home dadMany in New Zealand and around the world had held up her pregnancy - just the second time an elected leader had given birth in office since Pakistan\u0027s Benazir Bhutto in 1990 - as a symbol of progress for women.Hopefully these things that in these moments now are...a novelty...one day they aren\u0027t new any more, Ms Ardern said.I hope for little girls and boys that actually there\u0027s a future where they can make choices about how they raise their family and what kind of career they have that are based on what they want and what makes them happy.How a discarded restaurant napkin led to an arrest in the 32-year-old cold case of a murdered US schoolgirlPierce Brosnan endorses Tom Hardy as the next James BondRoseanne Barr apologises for racist tweet during tearful first interview since her sitcom was cancelledComment: Universities churn out graduates of dubious quality who infect society with disappointment.

new generation incredible young leaders","story":"digitalservices@telegraphThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex will meet the young leaders at Buckingham Palace this weekDuchess of SussexDuke of SussexBetween them, they are fighting mental health stigma, tackling violence against women and quite literally saving lives around the Commonwealth, all in the name of the Queen.Little wonder that the Duke of Sussex, working with his grandmother for the “incredible” youth of the Family of Nations, is feeling “hugely optimistic” about the future.The Duke, who will be joined by his new wife the Duchess at a Buckingham Palace reception to honour them, said today\u0027s generation holds the key to tackling the world\u0027s biggest issues as his grandmother honours them for their quiet, diligent work in their communities.He told the Sunday : “I have really enjoyed meeting so many of them over the past four years, and their passion and understanding always leaves me hugely optimistic about the future.The Queen’s legacy project, launched five years ago, will see community stars from around the Commonwealth meet Her Majesty at Buckingham Palace to receive words of encouragement about their future.This year, the Duchess of Sussex will attend the Queen’s Young Leaders reception for the first time, as the newlywed couple embark on their own work to continue the Queen’s lifetime of Commonwealth service.Among the award winners are a young man who has saved 1,000 lives by setting up an app for emergency response, an Australian tackling toxic masculinity, and a Londoner who grew up in a single-parent family on a council estate and now works to encourage people from her own background into medicine.“When the Queen tells you you’ve done a good job, that changes everything,” said Rahat Hossain, who set up an app to coordinate the emergency response to disasters in Bangladesh.Leanne Armitage, 23, who grew up in an area blighted by knife crime and now runs Leanne’s Amazing Medics to encourage others to follow her into medicine, said of being honoured by the Royal family: “In our generation, most young people who are celebrated or have the limelight shone on them are musicians, or doing something popular.“For us to be doing something important in our communities to improve people’s lives, and be recognised for that and celebrated, it’s really honourable.”Hunter Johnson, founder of The Man Cave which aims to teach young men about positive relationships and their own mental health, said: “It’s an investment in our future, and that’s very special. “It’s blown the roof off my house of what I thought was possible.“Young people are often seen as a problem to be solved, and it’s such a flip on the message to have the profile and the platform to get the good news about the Commonwealth out there.“It’s phenomenal for us, but it’s also giving our generation a platform to say hey, this is the future.”Hauwa Ojeifo, who founded She Writes Women and a helpline which has already helped more than 200 women in Nigeria, said: “For me, what I’m taking away is validation and I think we all need that sometimes.“You’re working so hard, you’re doing so many things, and it’s given me the confidence that I can keep going and do everything I want to do.”The Duke of Sussex said: I have seen time and time again, through my work with young people from across the Commonwealth, that today\u0027s generation understands something very important: that to tackle a big issue, you need to focus on the root causes of the challenge, not its symptoms.The Queen\u0027s Young Leaders are having an incredible impact in their respective countries because they have adopted this mindset.”The Queen at Ascot on SaturdayHe and the Duchess will later this year go on their first tour to meet the people of the Commonwealth, to Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand.The Duchess, then Meghan Markle, has previously worked with a Queen\u0027s Young Leader winner of 2017, Suhani Jalota: founder of the Myna Mahila Foundation, one of the charity\u0027s on the couple\u0027s wedding gift list. Duchess of SussexDuke of SussexPlease review our commenting policyHow a

The runoff would take place July 8.Mr Ince and other opposition leaders have warned that Mr Erdogan’s supporters may try to rig the results to keep the Turkish president in power. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan votes with his grandchildren in IstanbulBy Sunday afternoon, opposition parties were already claiming that Mr Erdogan’s allies had attempted to stuff ballot boxes in the rural district of Suruc near the Syrian border. Videos appeared to show a man opening a ballot box there. “We urge the authorities to take action against the collective and open stuffing of ballot boxes,” the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) said on Twitter. There were reports of a scuffle at the polling station in Suruc and voting was briefly halted there.We\u0027re watching the incident in Suruc very closely, said Meral Akşener, presidential candidate for the nationalist IYI party. I urge state officials to save the honour of the state.Police fired warning shots to stop a speeding car in Suruc, where they found four bags full of stamped ballot papers, according to the Dogan News Agency. Three people were detained.A local official with the IYI party was also killed in a fight at a polling station in the eastern city of Erzurum, party spokeswoman said. Turkish media reported the fight broke out after interior ministry officials tried to enter the polling station.In his final campaign rally in Istanbul on Saturday, Mr Ince urged his CHP supporters to head to polling stations and carefully monitor ballot boxes to prevent election fraud. “I’m declaring 36 hours of mobilisation,” he told the crowd.At Sensipasa Elementary School in the Uskudar neighbourhood of Istanbul, CHP supporters answered the call. Fatih Bayhan, a 55-year-old trader, came to his polling station at 5am to monitor the handling of ballots. Muharrem Ince, Mr Erdogan\u0026#39s main challenger, called for his supporters to protect the vote“It we thought the election was going to be fair we wouldn’t have been here around the ballot boxes at dawn,” he said. Despite his concern over vote rigging, Mr Bayhan said he still thought the opposition had a chance to win the election. “I’m hopeful,” he said.Mr Erdogan’s supporters also turned out at the polls, with many citing the rise in living standards since 2003 as their reason for backing the president. “I have never seen a better president than Erdogan, said Nermin, a 74-year-old pensioner who declined to give her last name. “Before him there weren’t good roads, there was garbage everywhere, we had shortages of tap water.”Turkey has has a long history of fair elections dating back to the 1950s. But last year’s referendum on changing the constitution was marred by last-minute changes to voting rules and allegations of ballot box stuffing by Mr Erdogan’s party.   Among the changes was a decision by the electoral commission, made on the day of the 2017 referendum, to accept ballots that hadn’t been stamped by election officials. Election observers from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) concluded “late changes in counting procedures removed an important safeguard” on voting. Polling began on Sunday, with 56,322,632 registered voters and 180,065 ballot boxes across the countryThe same rules are in place for today’s election, which critics say leave them open to fraud.Hundreds of ballot box watchers from the pro-Kurdish People’s Democratic Party (HDP) have been arrested in recent weeks, in what the party says is an attempt to weaken its ability to monitor for election fraud.“They have arrested hundreds and are trying to scare the rest from coming to the polling stations,” said Garo Paylan, an HDP member of parliament. In his own final campaign rally, Mr Erdogan scoffed at warnings of voter fraud. “What is that? This country is based on law, he said. “Except for terror zones, we haven\u0027t held any elections with any flaws in 15 years.”If Mr Erdogan wins the election he would have a five-year term and would be eligible to run for a second term in 2023. In theory, Mr Erdogan could be in power until 2028, meaning he would have led Turkey for a quarter of century since 2003. Please review our commenting policyHow a discarded restaurant napkin led to an arrest in the 32-year-old cold case of a murdered US schoolgirlPierce Brosnan endorses Tom Hardy as the next James BondRoseanne Barr apologises for racist tweet during tearful first interview since her sitcom was cancelledComment: Universities churn out graduates of dubious quality who infect society with disappointment.

For years, I navigated conservative religious spaces, where I encountered bigotry and attempts to shame LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople and women as often as I found warmhearted people eager to serve others.There was more than a little racism, too. I’ve heard the statement “I’ll pray for you” said with love, and with judgment and scorn. I know the difference, and the folks who confronted me outside the cafe were making their judgement clear.Instead of a theological debate that usually goes nowhere for lack of good faith in discussion, I wanted them to feel what it’s like to have someone supposedly approach in love but inflict pain and discomfort. Perhaps that’s what it takes. A forced perspective in empathy. Why not try that approach?I could have ignored them but I’ve had it with some evangelicals giving a bad name to their community by insisting on defining people’s humanity for them. These three assumed I was broken because of my gender identity. They saw the constellation of my personhood through a backward telescope.It angered me that the whole of my being could be reduced to their flawed understanding of LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople, a view that could easily be revised if only they would take the time to get to know me instead of assuming they already did.So I would be damned if I would let them interrupt my Sunday afternoon coffee when I certainly wasn’t bothering them.I asked their spokeswoman if she understood how it might look to be searching for “broken” people to pray for, and specifically pick out a random transgender person. And they looked more than taken aback.I stood up, smiling but internally annoyed, and asked them what the Book of Matthew says about prayer. Their eyes went wide. One guy stammered nervously, clearly having trouble answering the question.The other two were just as flummoxed, ambushed by the idea that the “broken” transgender person was asking a simple question about a common verse on prayer in Matthew.For those who don’t know, Matthew is the first book in the New Testament and one of the three Synoptic Gospels, each of which are narratives of the life of Christ, frequently using the same stories, often with identical wording.While all three contain instruction on prayer, I reached for Matthew 18:20 because of its strong presence in the evangelical community and its common misapplication by members. In short, it reads: “For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them.”Those up on their biblical knowledge might wonder why I didn’t turn to Matthew 6:5-7, scathing verses that call out hypocrites who are performative in their Christianity, telling them to pray in private rather than out on the streets so that they might be seen by others.It’s a good one that, unsurprisingly, is ignored in evangelical circles. They know it’s there, but it’s inconvenient.The verse I selected hits hard instead because it’s so commonly heard before a group prayer in evangelical churches. There, it tends to be inaccurately interpreted as a numbers game, one that’s about bringing to fruition what is requested of God in prayer.Evangelicals think of it as a call to bring more people into the church or, more cynically, personal prosperity through the Gospel.In reality, it’s a verse on accountability before God and about how God may work that accountability through humans. As Leisa Baysinger notes on the blog Our Ancient Paths, it references earlier Jewish tradition that at least three witnesses must agree to bring judgement on someone.In the moment I was unaware of its exact roots, which were surprisingly apt given the attempt of this small band to sit in judgement of me, but I still understood what was at stake in the line, and I loved the idea of using a verse on accountability that they had probably misunderstood numerous times.I was the judged who understands the law better than those attempting to judge, and on that day I sought to bring accountability.These aren’t issues I take lightly, and the passive-aggressive condescension of these three was anything but harmless. This wasn’t the time to be polite.Not when the Trump-Pence White House is trying to ban transgender people from the military. Not when transgender students with stories of discrimination are turned away by the US\u0026nbspDepartment of Education.Not when President Donald Trump and vice president\u0026nbspMike Pence\u0026nbspare seeking to implement a Health and Human Services Department regulation allowing healthcare workers to deny potentially lifesaving treatment to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.Not when the Human Rights Campaign reports that in the US, eight transgender people have been killed in 2018 and 28 in 2017 –\u0026nbspthe most ever annually. I wasn’t going to be silent.Instead, I spoke.“You know how Matthew says that where two or three are gathered in Jesus’ name, there he is with us?”They stared at me blankly. I had no intention of going easy on them.“That is what Matthew says, is it not?”At last, one spoke up: “Yes, that’s right.”And they nervously stepped forward into a circle.I said to one:\u0026nbsp“You start us off.” And she did, going through the motions quickly and antiseptically because they clearly wanted to get as far as they could from this awkward situation. And then I picked it up when it was clear she was done.“Lord Jesus, thank you for the benefit of these friends,” I began, wholly honest with God about how I hoped she would bless my new friends, encouraging them to affirm and be inclusive of others. I was hopeful that their community would honour all as God made them and value the strength of ersity.I mentioned the natural beauty of the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and thanked God again for making us as we are, throwing in a genuine wish that their trip back home would be a safe one.Then, knowing my audience, I wrapped up with the usual evangelical banal phraseology –\u0026nbsp“no weapons shall be formed against them”,\u0026nbsp“put God on their hearts” –\u0026nbspto let them know I was just as familiar with their community’s vernacular as they were, maybe more so.As I finished, having returned their “let us pray for you” to them tenfold, they murmured their thank you’s and scuttled away.I don’t know whether my words made it through, but I hope they have a sense of what it feels like to have a stranger impose self-righteous venom on them. I also hope that they’ll realise how much actions such as these diminish the power of prayer and enable so much harm to LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople.A prayer that one might change their sexuality or gender identity is egregious encouragement to those who would seek to discriminate against LGBT+\u0026nbsppeople in our laws and to do violence against them in our communities. My own prayer’s acidity served to make them aware of their own by way of spiritual inoculation.The Genderquake debate did more harm than good for transgender peopleWhy has Caitlyn Jenner been chosen to speak about ‘ersity’?These people did not want to know more about me. They wanted to talk at me and pray at me. And I’m confident that’s not how Jesus would go about it.There are many in the evangelical community who love and affirm their LGBT+\u0026nbspfamily, friends and fellow human beings.It’s unfortunate, then, that others in the community still must be told a simple truth: They are not doing the Lord’s work by politicising prayer at the expense of others or by dumping their misplaced condescension on strangers they believe to be broken.Prayer should be a loving act, not a weapon of marginalisation.Clymer ia a transgender woman,\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspArmy veteran and\u0026nbsppress secretary at the Human Rights Campaign\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Opponents said it would also unfairly penalise people in social housing, as only they would be liable to be evicted.UK news in picturesDemonstrators at the People\u0027s March demanding a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in London, on the second anniversary of the 2016 referendum.Andria Marsh, 63, holds up photographs of her parents and her original British passport, following a Windrush service at Westminster Abbey in London.

He urged Indians to be proud of their culture and history.“The gems of India’s unique heritage, such as yoga, will be respected by the world at large only when we ourselves respect our culture and traditions,” he said.Around the world, public yoga events were held in Afghanistan, Japan and Peru, while Australia and South Africa celebrated on Monday.“From Tokyo to Toronto, from Stockholm to Sao Paulo, yoga has become a positive influence in the lives of millions,” Mr Modi told participants on the lush green lawns.“In a world where non-communicable diseases, stress and lifestyle related ailments are rising, yoga can play a central role in mitigating these diseases to create a healthy mind and body.”In the buildup to Thursday’s event, Mr Modi took part in a social media campaign, begun by his BJP party ministers, to get people to share videos of their fitness workouts on Twitter.Celebrities\u0026nbspfrom Bollywood actors to sports superstars\u0026nbspgot involved, and Mr Modi’s own video showed him performing yoga on a boulder in his prime ministerial gardens.Social media was again awash with videos emulating Mr Modi’s on Thursday, including from staff at Delhi airport, pupils at thousands of schools and members of India’s armed forces.Amid questions over his appeal, PM Modi’s party sweeps to key victoryPlea to Indian PM in London for ‘tortured’ captive elephants Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused of spying on citizens India PM makes point of visiting Palestinians after meeting NetanyahuThe Indian navy released pictures of sailors doing yoga on board the world’s oldest aircraft carrier, the INS Viraat, decommissioned last year, and soldiers guarding the world’s highest battleground, the Siachen glacier in northern Jammu and Kashmir state, did yoga routines at an altitude of around 18,000 feet.The events clearly mustered a huge amount of public support. For some, however, there was a sinister edge to having public institutions take part in a scheme closely associated with the prime minister’s messaging. Even prisons were involved, with 15,000 inmates due to take part in yoga events on Thursday in the capital alone.Sagarika Ghose, a prominent journalist and political commentator, wrote on Twitter: “Believer in yoga, try every morning, immense benefits. But concerned: why does a GOVERNMENT need to promote yoga? Yoga’s an inidual choice, a personal option.”Mr Modi’s rule, she said, was “fast becoming an escapist Bollywood film where song and dance attempt to distract from hard realities”. One of the most liked responses to Ms Ghose’s tweet told her to “go to Pakistan” if she couldn’t show loyalty to India.For Ajay Mehra, a political scientist at Delhi University, the International Day of Yoga “has become an imposition”, forced on the people by government.“Something like yoga should not be part of a political project,” he told The Independent, adding that there were certain yogic practices – chanting mantras for instance – that could be offensive to some groups in a plural society, “Muslims in particular”.Mr Mehra noted that Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, stressed the importance of secular, pluralist leadership while also being a devoted practitioner of yoga – “but he didn’t publicise it”.International Day of YogaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

When the downpour finally came, it was worse than anyone feared.In just four days, Cox’s Bazar received two-thirds of the average rainfall expected in the month of June. More than 100 landslides have been reported, several people have died and hundreds of families have been made homeless, forced to sleep in mosques or crowd into shelters with their relatives.Ahead of World Refugee Day\u0026nbspon Wednesday, the UN released a report showing that the number of displaced people in the world has risen to a new record high of 68.5 million, and highlighting the plight of the Rohingya fleeing persecution in Myanmar as one of the biggest drivers pushing up that number.But speaking from Cox’s Bazar in a break in the weather that has coincided with the end of the Ramadan fast, Caroline Gluck, a senior official with the UN’s refugee agency, said their message this year was to “celebrate” World Refugee Day as a tribute to those struggling through such hardship, and the charities fighting to help them.As is the case with the wider refugee crisis across the globe, the population of those displaced in Bangladesh is made up mostly of women and children. Aid workers have found that creating women-only centres for healthcare, counselling and childcare is having a dramatic impact on the Rohingya’s quality of life.Rohingya women and girls are taught sewing, play games, receive medical care and are offered counselling at women-only centres run by charities like IRC in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Jessica Wanless)“In any crisis, women and children are the most vulnerable,” Ms Gluck told The Independent - a problem only exacerbated as flooding and landslides cripple camp infrastructure. “Night-time can be a worrying time, particularly if you have to travel to use toilets. The camp is quite sprawled, and instead of living alongside people you know, you are living with strangers.”One of the charities providing women-only centres is the International Rescue Committee (IRC). Dalia Al-Awqati, IRC’s emergency director in Bangladesh, said up to 80 per cent of the refugees are women and children and in need of “specialised support”.“Many Rohingya women and girls have been raped, seen their husbands and children killed before their eyes and lots of them are facing raising their children alone,” she told The Independent. “They live in a situation that is exacerbated by the presence of stigma and discrimination.”IRC\u0027s women-only centres (Jessica Wanless)For 12-year-old Azara, the centre is an oasis of normalcy in a situation that is anything but, and a welcome break from the boredom that comes with living in a refugee camp.She said she came to the centre every day, finding a safe space where she can make friends, play games and engage in her favourite pastime - henna.“It feels like home,” she said. “We come straight after we have been to school. Every week there is at least one day for sewing. Every week we learn something new. We love to learn.”Ex-UN ambassador says \u0027destroying Rohingya exceeds costs\u0027 for MyanmarRohingya facing \u0027crisis on top of crisis\u0027 as world looks other wayRohingya say Myanmar singled out the educated in genocideArmed Rohingya group massacred Hindus in Myanmar, report alleges\u0027Bittersweet\u0027 Ramadan for Rohingya Muslims forced to flee their homesMs Gluck said centres like those run by the IRC were vital to encourage women “carrying the burden” of what happened to them in Myanmar to come forward and seek counselling and support, in what is traditionally a very culturally conservative society.Media reports have previously highlighted a spike in births nine months after the alleged brutal crackdown by Myanmar’s army in Rakhine state that forced the Rohingya to flee. The danger, Ms Gluck said, is that all pregnancies in the camp become stigmatised as potentially being the result of rape.And one of the biggest positives to come out of the creation of the centres has been the number of female volunteers working to foster new communities in their makeshift home.A lot of women are taking on jobs as safety volunteers or in counselling their fellow refugees directly, having received training from NGOs. “It has helped women to develop roles that they didn’t have back home,” Ms Gluck said.Senwara stands in the Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Timothy NesmithIRC)Senwara, a 35-year-old mother of four, is a volunteer who helps spread word about the centre to other refugees. She became the only female “Majhi” or community leader in her area of the camp after helping distribute food aid, and sees promoting the centre as part of her responsibility.“Women come here to this centre because there are no men,” she said. “If there were men, families would not let teenagers or women giving birth come here because they would feel shy. They are serious about this matter.”Ms Gluck said the few days of good weather, plus celebrations around Eid, had brought “joy to many faces” in the camps. There is an upbeat mood also to coincide with World Refugee Day, with singing, volleyball and other competitions put on to showcase the best of life in the camps.Rohingya Crisis in Photos Rohingya

He added that the dossier would involve a “census of Roma in Italy” which would “see who, how, how many”. He added: “Unfortunately, you need to keep Italian Roma in Italy.”The country\u0026nbspis estimated to be home to between 100,000 and 180,000 Roma.The minister’s actions drew criticism from human rights groups and opposition politicians.“The way is short from a census to a concentration camp.

Instead, like so much else in the country, it’s a combination of religious diktats, social pressure and purposefully convoluted licensing rules which has effectively stifled women’s freedoms and make it illegal for them to get behind the wheel.\u0026nbspWhen a royal decree goes into effect on Sunday, for the first time in decades, that is going to change.\u0026nbsp The independence is going to revolutionise life for many - including Pilar al Amad, from Kohbar, on Saudi Arabia’s east coast. If the rules had changed a few months earlier, she says her recent family tragedy may have been a little easier to deal with. \u0026nbsp“I was pregnant with twins and my husband was away with work when I went into labour,” she said.“I had to rely on people from work to drive me to the hospital and it was really stressful. I lost one of my twins a week after delivery. I feel like if I had just been able to drive the whole situation would have been easier.”Pilar’s surviving baby daughter has been in an intensive care unit for the last three months.“I can’t wait to be able to come and go as I please without having to go when my husband goes or else pay for an Uber,” she added.\u0026nbspLifting the driving ban is a deeply symbolic move in a country where ship system means that most decisions in a woman’s life are made for her by her father, husband or son.The kingdom’s newly appointed and immensely powerful crown prince, 32-year-old Mohammed bin Salman, is the driving force behind the new measure aimed at liberalising Saudi society - which will, crucially, bring more women into the workforce.Allowing women to drive is part of ‘Vision 2030’, an ambitious roadmap of socio-economic reforms designed to wean the kingdom off its dependence on oil revenue.\u0026nbsp Other bold moves include curbing the powers of the once notorious religious police and even a promise the conservative kingdom will return to a more “moderate” form of Islam.\u0026nbspBefore Prince Mohammed was appointed crown prince a year ago, such rapid change was unthinkable. In visits before and after his appointment, however, The Independent has witnessed how many ordinary Saudis have begun to relax into the changes.In the Red Sea city of Jeddah, more and more women are choosing to forego wearing headscarves altogether, and shops sell abayas - the cloak-like robe women must wear by law - in navy, grey and white as well as black. Even in the more conservative desert capital, Riyadh, people now blast Western pop music from cars and groups of teenagers - both boys and girls - roam around parks and malls unsupervised.\u0026nbspSunday’s historic moment is somewhat overshadowed by the arrests of 17 prominent women’s rights activists in the weeks leading up to the lifting of the ban.\u0026nbspWhile eight have been released on bail since, the rest have still not been charged and have not been allowed access to their families or lawyers.The arrests have widely been viewed as an attempt to intimate Saudi Arabia’s tiny activist community - and serve as a reminder to everyone that change in the kingdom will only come from the top down.\u0026nbspDespite the crackdown, though, excitement for Sunday is building. Newspapers and television stations across the country have gone into overdrive celebrating “history in the making”.\u0026nbspPink “ladies’ parking” spaces have sprung up in major cities and community events focussing on family road safety organised under the slogan “Tawakkali wa Intaliqi”, or ‘Have Faith and Drive”, are planned across the country tomorrow.“Everyone is embracing the changes,” said Susan Newbon, a driving instructor from South Wales who is training up Saudi women to teach their own driving students and hold exams.\u0026nbsp“This is a young nation, where people know change is overdue. It’s logistically a massive undertaking but Saudis are more than ready to be able to do this. There’s a real sense of celebration.”Many challenges are still waiting in the wings. Complex rules on the mixing of genders in work and social environments mean it’s not clear whether women-owned businesses or female employees can mix with male customers and clients in certain industries the threat of harassment and backlash from religious conservatives is also a problem feared by many women.\u0026nbspThe long overdue social reforms are also being ushered in in part to sweeten a bitter pill: the House of Saud has been badly hit by a global plunge in oil prices since 2015.Saudi Arabia struggles to employ its most-educated womenSAUDI WOMEN: Tahany Omar, 36, has a Masters of Business Administration from the US but has found the job market challenging in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia she works in an investment firm, but not in management.

The government introduced its first-ever VAT (at 5 per cent) on 1 January and has begun phasing out fuel subsidies - meaning that while women will be able to get behind the wheel from next week, it will cost a lot to fill up the tank, and there aren’t enough jobs for everyone to drive to.Mohammed bin Salman’s reforms are more a continuation of the House of Saud’s long-term thinking than an out of the blue new agenda, David Butter, an associate fellow at London’s Chatham House, told The Independent.\u0026nbsp“Lifting the driving ban will provide a lot more scope for women to participate in the workforce and society,” he said. “But the changes do raise all sorts of questions.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry BAN mention of Brexit It accuses EU negotiators of intransigence in the Brexit talks and calls on Mrs May to strengthen her negotiating hand by accelerating UK nodeal preparations.Such a step would mean Britain is ready to walk away from the table if the EU continues to frustrate efforts to secure a free trade agreement, and operate on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms instead.The letter is signed by more than 20 senior pro-Brexit politicians, including ex-cabinet ministers Owen Paterson, David Jones and John Redwood.Other signatories include Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin, JML\u0026rsquos John Mills and John Longworth, former director general of the British Chambers of Commerce.The letter advises the Prime Minister that \u0026ldquoto have any real leverage in the Brexit endgame, the UK must reserve the right to walk away without a trade deal and take with it the \u0026pound39billion it has offered to pay as part of a orce settlement.This money must be contingent on our securing a satisfactory free trade deal.

They’ve far too much to discuss among themselves.”Migration is plunging European politics into crisis again. German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition is threatening to break apart over the issue.While in Italy, the new government is threatening to close its southern border — blocking migrant rescue ships from landing — and open its northern border, encouraging illegal migrants and asylum seekers to head north to Germany and Sweden.So worried is European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that he is hosting a mini-summit tomorrow to try to find a solution to the migrant crisis which can help save Merkel’s political career.It is tempting to look at the EU in crisis and say that is why the UK is leaving. But this crisis is making it more difficult for Britain to get a reasonable Brexit deal.The European Commission is running the Brexit negotiations.Its priority is in defending the theology of the European Union, rather than finding practical solutions. As one leading figure in the Government laments to me, Brussels’ chief negotiator Michel Barnier “won’t budge off CETA (Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) with Northern Ireland stuck in the customs union”.This kind of Canada-style free trade deal is regarded by the Government as inadequate.Mrs May and co have long hoped that the member states, nearly all of whose economies would be hurt by such a limited agreement, would intervene at some point and tell the Commission to engage more constructively with the UK. But this is happening all too rarely.One of the reasons is, in the words of one member of the Brexit inner Cabinet: “Only four national capitals are fully across Brexit.”Many of the countries that are most sympathetic to the UK don’t have the capacity to follow all of the issues concerned.Over the past few years, the key to any deal in Europe has been Merkel. She is not now going to ride to Britain’s rescue— as David Cameron found to his cost in the renegotiation.But the German Chancellor could push the Commission towards a slightly more pragmatic approach.However, she is now trying to keep her own governing coalition together, as well as come up with a deal with the French for eurozone reform, leaving next to no time for Brexit.I am told that when Brexit is discussed in meetings she is “visibly distracted”, turning to aides for advice far more frequently than she does on other issues.This situation is one of the many reasons why the Government should have prepared vigorously for no deal: A credible threat to walk away from the table if the Commission didn’t behave in a reasonable fashion would have got the member states’ attention.But Mrs May now must hope the EU can patch together some deal on migration and that the member states begin thinking seriously about what kind of post-Brexit relationship they want with this country.WHEN the Cabinet gathers at Chequers next month to thrash out the UK’s offer to the EU, one of the most contentious issues will be customs.The Brexit inner Cabinet is split between those who favour a so-called “new customs partnership” (NCP) with the EU – which would see the UK continue to apply EU tariffs after Brexit, with companies receiving a rebate if their goods stayed in Britain rather than heading to the continent – and those who advocate Max Fac, which would use technology to minimise border checks.Two Cabinet working groups are trying to find a way to make these ideas work. Neither group has had a decisive breakthrough yet. But I am told the Max Fac one is “not a million miles away” from a solution.The challenge for the PM is to make these plans acceptable to her own side, including David Davis and Liam Fox. One Brexit inner Cabinet member tells me: “She’s got to have David and Liam. If she doesn’t have them, then she has no solution.”Both Davis and Fox support the Max Fac option. But there are influential figures in No10 who remain convinced that NCP is the option to go for. They argue only NCP can help deal with the Irish border issue and get the Government through next month’s crucial Commons votes on the customs union. They warn: “No NCP, no Brexit.”The fear among Brexiteers is Mrs May will use this Chequers meeting to try to push through a modified version of NCP. They fear the reason the whole Cabinet will be present on the second day is to give Mrs May the numbers to do this if the Brexit inner Cabinet remains split on the issue.Doing this, though, would be extremely risky. It would leave Mrs May with a policy that neither her Brexit Secretary nor her International Trade Secretary support.THE Chancellor and the Defence Secretary aren’t just split over how much money the military should get, but what it should be spent on, too.One Cabinet ally of Philip Hammond’s complains that Gavin Williamson wants to “spend the money on uniformed officers when he should be spending it on robotics and the like”.Their view is that this would be a better response to the 21st-century security challenges Britain faces.But in truth, Britain needs both conventional and new, hi-tech forces if it is to respond to the variety of threats now out of there. That is why we MUST spend more on defence.Those close to Williamson point out that if the Government doesn’t increase the defence budget, our status as the leading military spender in Europe – upon which so much of our influence in the world depends – will be under threat as the French and the Germans increase their military budgets.NEXT week, Theresa May will give a speech setting out the Government’s post-Brexit industrial strategy.Key to this must be artificial intelligence, an area where we are one of the leading nations in the world.I understand that the importance of maintaining the UK’s edge in AI is what led to Mrs May accepting Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Digital Secretary Matt Hancock’s argument that visa rules for tech entrepreneurs must be relaxed.The countries that succeed at AI will end up defining this century.So any deal with the EU must preserve the UK’s ability to regulate these industries of the future in a way decided by us, not Brussels.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is staggering that the ­Government is still undecided on ­fundamental principles.But the Tories’ woes were hugely exacerbated by their election calamity, caused in part by Remainers hoping Labour would betray Brexit.That emboldened diehards in the Lords and Commons — operating alongside the lavishly-funded, slickly orchestrated campaign colluding with Brussels to annul the biggest vote in our history.Meanwhile the national conversation has degenerated into a tsunami of hate, chiefly from sanctimonious Remainers branding Leavers uneducated racists.How much better off we would all now be if on June 24, 2016 they had grudgingly accepted defeat and pledged instead to make the best of Brexit.In fairness, some Remainers did. TV’s Richard Madeley spoke for them recently when he said we now had a duty to see it through in full by leaving the single market and customs union.He was right. To pretend that Brexit can be “softened” to honour the substantial Remain vote — a nightmarish fudge which Boris Johnson warns of today — is simply dishonest. There is leaving and there is remaining. That’s it.Brussels has revelled in Britain tearing itself apart. Now it is sidetracked by its own problems. A deal looks miles off.Theresa May has only one path forward. At next month’s pivotal vote, she must defeat the backbench rebellion hoping to shackle us to a customs union restricting our trading future. That is not Brexit, as voters would quickly realise. It would reignite the Leave ­campaign with unprecedented ferocity.And the PM and her Cabinet must not be derailed by Remain-fanatic businesses muttering about pulling out. Previous such threats have proved bogus, like all those dire economic forecasts.Leaving may not be smooth in the short-term. That must not deter us.When the EU finally realises Brexit in full is inevitable maybe they will stop playing games and agree a deal.But if the Remain resistance succeeds in crippling Brexit, it will bring on chaos.Our current divisions will seem like happy hour.

I’m out of here.”Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith has told Mrs May to turn the tables on “bullying” Eurocrats when she returns to Brussels this week.He believes she is in her strongest ­position yet to get them to discuss their relationship with Britain when we leave on March 29 next year.In the 15 months since Article 50 was triggered, they have refused to discuss trade while our own MPs argued among themselves.But Mrs May’s hand was strengthened last week after she saw off the rebels to get the EU Withdrawal Bill through ­Parliament.Tory MP Mr Duncan Smith warned she must show her mettle as she faces the biggest test of any PM in peacetime at next week’s Brussels showdown.He told The Sun on Sunday: “Theresa May now has the upper hand in these talks.They have been watching us fight among ourselves over Brexit for months and didn’t have to do anything because her position was so weak.“They knew there was an outside chance it wouldn’t happen, so they’ve dug in on all the practical stuff such as trade and bogged us down with other details.“But now it has been voted through. We are leaving. They cannot stop it.“I’ve advised Theresa to tell them bluntly to agree to talk about trade or she is leaving.“If they refuse to engage, she must have the resolve to get up and leave the table — making clear she will take our ­£40billion contribution with her.“Theresa must put her cards on the table and tell them she wants to talk about trade now.“If they tell her they don’t want to, she should put her business card on the table and say ‘Tell you what.There’s my ­number. Give me a buzz if you change your minds.Meanwhile, we’ve got nothing more to say to you’.“Then she should turn to her aides and say, ‘We can catch the ten past six if we hurry now.Can you get some cars because we’re on our way.We’ve got work to do. Nice to see you all. OK, guys. Take care. Goodbye!’“That will bring them to their senses rather quickly.“The 27 other EU countries are desperate for a deal so they can sell us their cars, cheeses and potato products.“They’ve tried to push us around for the past couple of years but Theresa has the upper hand now and she must show them who’s boss.”Slamming the way EU officials have treated Britain as “disgusting”, Mr Duncan Smith said: “Undiplomatic doesn’t begin to cover it.“They’ve done their level best to ­humiliate and be rude to us. They are meant to be our friends and allies.”Singling out chief negotiator Michel Barnier, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and ­European Parliament co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt, he added: “Come this week, we can tell them their days of behaving like ­playground bullies are over.”He said Wednesday’s flagship vote was THE most significant bill passed in the Commons since the treaty to join the fledgling ­European Economic Community in 1973.Crucially, it removes any chance of Brexit being derailed and the clock really has begun ticking towards our departure in 278 days.Brexiteers now warn that the PM must finalise a deal by November, to leave time to clear it all by February.Mr Duncan Smith said: “She is in a stronger position than she’s been in for some months.Getting the most critical bit of legislation through last week means she goes to the European Council knowing our departure is now settled.“That means she is back in charge of the negotiation and there is no way they can stop Brexit.“Now it’s down to raw negotiation, and the question facing the EU is how much they want to have a good relationship.“We do, and the Prime Minister has been open about that. But she has to be ready to walk away.“I’ve done negotiations in business and that’s what you do. You say, ‘There’s nothing on the table that I can agree to here. Sorry, I’m off’.“Never buy a car until you’ve attempted to walk out of the showroom at least twice.There is no better way to get the price down than to say, ‘I’m off, it’s too expensive, I’ll go somewhere else.’It’s not so much calling their bluff. It’s calling them out.“It’s kind of like poker — and Theresa has to force them to show their hand.”Last week’s decision to pump an extra £20billion into the NHS — partly funded by savings from EU contributions — will also send a clear message to Brussels that Britain is leaving.Mr Duncan Smith said: “It’s a down-payment that says we have to leave.“It shows she knows we’re leaving and we won’t be paying them any more money after a set time.”But has Mrs May got what it takes to face down the Brussels bully boys?Mr Duncan Smith said: “I think she has the steel to surprise them.“We’ve seen before what she’s like when she really digs her heels in.

BoJo declared: “We don’t want some bog roll Brexit – soft, yielding and seemingly infinitely long.”But Dr Fox said he’d be happy to let the process roll on a little longer, if it means making a clean break.He said: “What I wanted was that we were outside of the single market, the customs union and the European Court of Justice. That’s where I think we’re going to end up.“If we do it slightly more slowly in order to minimise any disruption, that’s fine by me. Having waited 40-odd years to leave the European Union, a few extra months doesn’t bother me if we‘re getting it right.”Dr Fox insists an extension to Article 50 to keep Britain in the EU beyond March 29 would be “politically unacceptable”. But on the second anniversary of the historic referendum, he said prolonging the implementation period beyond 2020 would not be a problem.The minister told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “If the transition period had to be extended for technical reasons with the backstop…and we already had the withdrawal agreement and future economic partnership agreed, I wouldn’t have a major problem with that.”He stressed that any extension must be “very time limited” and there must be a mechanism for Britain to pull out if we thought we were being kept in the EU against our will.The clash comes ahead of Theresa May’s trip to Brussels this week for her first showdown with EU chiefs since she saw off Brexit rebels to get the Withdrawal Bill through Parliament.Senior ministers have urged her to show she is prepared to play hardball and insist that talks no turn to our future trade relationship. Dr Fox warned EU negotiators would be unwise to think the PM is “bluffing” about the possibility of walking out without a deal.He told the BBC: “The Prime Minister has always said that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and that no deal would be better than a bad deal.I think it’s essential, as we enter the next phase of the negotiations, that the European Union understands and believes it.Our negotiating partners would not be wise if they believed that the Prime Minister was bluffing.”The minister warned that the economic impact on EU countries would be severe if they failed to strike a deal.But he said staying in the single market would be unacceptable because it would imply continuation of free movement of people and staying under the jurisdiction of the European Court.Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith today urges Mrs May to leave her business card on the table and walk away if EU chief rebuff he demands to talk trade.He told The Sun on Sunday: “She should say ‘Here’s my number.

Im so excited its actually happening.She had a US drivers license before obtaining a Saudi one and appeared comfortable at the wheel as she pulled up and parked.As for the male drivers on the road, she said: They were really supportive and cheering and smiling.In a few hours, she says shell drive herself to work for the first time in Saudi Arabia.Samira al-Ghamdi, 47, one of the first Saudi women to be issued with a driving licence, said: We are ready, and it will totally change our life.Saudi women with foreign licences only began converting them earlier this month, so the number of new drivers is expected to remain low at first.It will be some time before others learning to drive at new state-run schools are road ready, while some women still face resistance from conservative relatives.Many accustomed to using a private driver say they are reluctant to take on the Muslim kingdoms busy highways.Fayza al-Shammary, a 22-year-old saleswoman, said: I definitely wont like to drive.I like to be a princess with someone opening the car door for me and driving me anywhere.The change is part of sweeping reforms by the kings son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who aims to transform the economy of the worlds top oil exporter.The lifting of the ban, which for years drew international condemnation, has been welcomed by Western allies as proof of a new progressive trend in Saudi Arabia.For nearly three decades, outspoken Saudi women and the men who supported them had called for women to have the right to drive.They faced arrest for defying the ban as women in other Muslim countries drove freely.In 1990, during the first driving campaign by activists, women who got behind the wheels of their cars in the capital, Riyadh, lost their jobs, faced severe stigmatisation and were barred from travel abroad for a year.Ultraconservatives in Saudi Arabia had long warned that allowing women to drive would lead to sin and expose women to harassment.Ahead of allowing women to drive, the kingdom passed a law against sexual harassment with up to five years prison for the most severe cases.Criticism against women driving has largely been muted since since King Salman announced last year that they would be allowed to drive.Simultaneously, however, at least 10 of the most outspoken supporters of womens rights were arrested just weeks before the ban was lifted."},{"url":null,"title":"royal wedding thomas markle morning suit pr meghan","story":"Thomas Markle, 73, had been set to walk his daughter down the aisle at Windsor Castle for her big day but was unable to attend after suffering a heart attack.Instead the suit was left on the peg at upmarket Chelsea outfitters Oliver Brown.That is until Johnno Spence visited the shop and picked up the semi-bespoke morning suit at a knock-down price of £2,000.Meghan, now the Duchess of Sussex, is said to have personally commissioned the company’s owner Kristian Robson to make several outfits for her father, not just the suit for the wedding.The list included three shirts with size 18 collars and double cuffs, in blue, yellow and white a navy blue weekend suit a single-breasted waistcoat and a set of tails.A source told The Daily : When Johnno walked in, the tailor said: We’ve got the perfect morning suit for you as well as a summer suit and three shirts for you if you want them.Spence is said to have paid £2,000 for the items, around half the normal price and proudly wore the morning suit to Ascot.Oliver Brown, established 35 years ago, is the official tailor of Royal Ascot, where a top hat and tails are compulsory for Royal Enclosure guests.Spences PR firm, JSC Communications counts jockey Ryan Moore, National Hunt rider Nico de Boinville and Champion Apprentice jockey Josephine Gordon as clients."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000415655113.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tory mp nusrat ghani inspirational muslims","story":"But we live in a fantastic country where you are not limited by the expectations set upon you at birth and where tolerance runs deep.We should be proud our society has remained open.My own example shows what we have achieved.In one generation of setting foot in this great country, I am helping lay foundations for future generations.The Sun on Sunday’s super coverage of Inspirational Muslims will no doubt challenge misconceptions but most of all will inspire readers to live to their full potential.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We know that over three-quarters of them find offers for sugary sweets and snacks at checkouts annoying.“It’s our job to give power to parents to make healthier choices and to make their life easier in doing so.”Last night the obesity plan received broad support.Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: “Having a takeaway or eating out is no longer a treat, it’s a regular part of everyday life, yet too often menus are information free zones.“Clear and consistent information on menus at the point of choice is the bold commitment needed to help families make healthier choices and avoid obesity-related health problems.”Some supermarkets already restrict sales to under-16s after calls from teachers and experts.Ministers must decide on a 16 or 18 age limit. Research shows the drinks can trigger unruly and dangerous behaviour.Caroline Cerny, of the Obesity Health Alliance, added: “The plan crucially addresses the issue of children being continually exposed to junk food adverts when they watch their favourite TV shows and when they go online.”Chris Askew, of Diabetes UK, said: “With one in three children either overweight or obese before they leave primary school, it’s clear that bold, decisive action needs to be taken. Being overweight as a child can significantly increase your risk of developing serious conditions like Type 2 diabetes in the future.”But Advertising Association chief Stephen Woodford said: “UK advertising rules are already among the strictest in the world.“International experience and independent research has shown advertising bans have little impact on the wider societal issues that drive obesity, which is caused by the interaction of many complex factors and requires a multi-faceted solution.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Today they do their socialising online – and like junk food, it’s highly addictive.“We’ve got to do something about this. That’s why we want schools to play a part in getting pupils in the habit of exercising regularly.”Mr Hunt who runs up to six miles, three times a week, said he wants to help parents to help their kids.“We’re not going to halve childhood obesity through government action alone. We can do a few things to help raise awareness but in the end parents have to take responsibility for the health of their children.“So part of this is helping parents to understand how critical their role is.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The weekend began with claims Brexiteer Boris Johnson proclaimed f*** business! at a glitzy official reception. Now even Remain-backing Jeremy Hunt has joined the fray - by attacking Airbus\u0027s threat to leave the UK as completely inappropriate and demanding the firm get behind Theresa May. The aerospace giant - which has 14,000 UK staff - warned this week it will reconsider its investments in Britain if there is no Brexit deal. It was joined by Siemens and BMW, which warned it will have to start making contingency plans if there is still no clarity in the next couple of months.  Business leaders also launched an unprecedented joint attack on Theresa May\u0027s slow progress today. The CBI, Institute of Directors, British Chambers of Commerce, EEF manufacturing group and Federation of Small Businesses wrote: The clock is ticking increasingly loudly and the business community is concerned that time is running out. Yet instead of promising to speed up the pace of Brexit, Tory Cabinet ministers mounted a backlash against businesses for sounding the alarm. Health Secretary Mr Hunt urged people to ignore siren voices, telling the BBC: I thought it was completely inappropriate for businesses to be making these kinds of threats. We are at an absolutely critical moment in the Brexit discussions and what that means is that we need to get behind Theresa May to deliver the best possible Brexit - a clean Brexit.  The more that we undermine Theresa May the more likely we are to end up with a fudge, which would be an absolute disaster for everyone. Fellow Cabinet minister Liam Fox warned businesses must not force Britain to take no deal off the table - because it would hurt talks with Brussels. The Brexiteer International Trade Secretary told Sky News: I think that companies are right to say that if there’s no deal that won’t be good for Britain - but it won’t be good for Europe either. They should also be making the same case to European governments. That will be bad for them in an era where we have got complex integrated supply chains it will be necessarily bad for both sides. It comes after Boris Johnson was yesterday accused by EU diplomats of saying f*** business - at a reception to celebrate the Queen\u0027s birthday.  The Foreign Secretary is said to have uttered the reply when he was asked about business leaders\u0027 fears over leaving the EU. An ally told the Mirror Mr Johnson had no recollection of using the phrase f*** business - but did not outright deny he said it. A source close to the Cabinet minister added: He was misheard and was actually attacking lobbyists like the EU-funded CBI who are more interested in doing what\u0027s right for big multinational corporations instead of helping ordinary working Brits. Remain-backing peer Lord Rose, the former chairman of Marks and Spencer, told the Mail on Sunday Mr Johnson\u0027s alleged outburst was shocking and sad.

Our thoughts must be with the families of those 450 patients whose lives were shortened. What have learned this week has been quite simply devastating, shocking and heartbreaking. I pay tribute to my Liberal Democrat parliamentary colleague Norman Lamb for establishing the inquiry as minister and I thank the inquiry panel who has shown extraordinary dedication, under the calm, compassionate, relentless, determined leadership of the former Bishop of Liverpool James Jones in uncovering an injustice and revealing the truth about a shameful episode in our nation’s recent history. The Report is clear, concerns were first raised in 1991 but the hospital chose not to rectify the practise of prescribing the drugs involved. An inquiry was conduced which found an “almost routine use of opiates” since 1998, which “almost certainly shortened the lives of some patients”. But inexcusably this report was left to gather dust on a shelf for ten years. As the Rt Reverend Jones says, handing over a loved one to a hospital, to doctors and nurses, is an act of trust. That trust was betrayed. He goes on: “a large number of patients and their relatives understood that their admission to the hospital was for either rehabilitation or respite, they were, in effect, put on a terminal care pathway.” Others will come to their own judgement but for me that is unforgivable.

The Health Secretary is appalled at new figures which show a quarter of youngsters aged six to nine knock back the fizzy products, which are laden with sugar and caffeine. So today he will announce a consultation on plans to stop shops selling them to under-18s in a bid to halve childhood obesity by 2030. Mr Hunt will say: “It is near impossible to shield children from exposure to unhealthy foods. Parents are asking for help.  “It’s our job to give them power to make healthier choices and make their lives easier in doing so.” Supermarkets Asda, Waitrose, Tesco and the Co-op introduced a voluntary ban on selling energy drinks with over 150mg of caffeine a litre earlier this year. Red Bull and similar drinks can contain as much caffeine as a strong coffee and up to a dozen teaspoonfuls of sugar. Shops will also be stopped from putting sweets at checkouts or offering them in buy-one-get-one-free deals.  TV ads promoting foods high in fat, sugar or salt are likely to be banned before the 9pm watershed and there will be mandatory calorie labelling in restaurants, cafes and takeaways. Public Health England boss Duncan Selbie welcomed what he called “bold steps” in the war on rising childhood obesity. Cancer Research UK and Diabetes UK also backed Mr Hunt’s plans. But Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “We need bold action not another watered-down, lame duck strategy.”  “It’s our job to give them power to make healthier choices and to make their life easier in doing so. “The cost of obesity – both on individual lives and to our NHS – is too great to ignore.” Supermarkets Asda, Waitrose, Tesco and the Co-op introduced a voluntary ban on selling energy drinks with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre earlier this year. Mr Hunt will go further and make it illegal for all shops to sell the drinks to kids, and is considering putting them on a par with alcohol so only over 18s can buy them. Stores will also be stopped from putting tempting sweets at check-outs where children pester their parents for them, or including them in buy-one-get-one-free offers. TV ads promoting high fat, sugar or salt foods are likely to be banned before the 9pm watershed and there will be mandatory calorie labelling in restaurants, cafes and takeaways.

Jeremy Corbyn critic John Woodcock has demanded a genuinely independent investigation and told Labour\u0027s general secretary: You have shown disregard for the law.  The Barrow and Furness MP was suspended from Labour in April over leaked claims he sent inappropriate texts and emails to a former staffer.  Mr Woodcock vehemently denies the claims, which are still under investigation by the Labour Party .  In a personal letter to Labour general secretary Jennie Formby, the MP said: I am writing to notify you that I am withdrawing my co-operation from your tainted disciplinary process.  He requested that she make arrangements to transfer the complaint into the hands of a Parliamentary probe or appropriately qualified, independent arbiter. Regardless of whether other Labour members share my misgivings about Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, no one should be prepared to tolerate the disdain for due process and the rule of law that has been allowed to fester within Labour, he wrote. He added: You have shown disregard for the law by completely ignoring my formal request to release by the legally stipulated date information held about me by the party. That information was requested at the beginning of May and should have been provided promptly - in any event no later than the statutory deadline of 13 June. I\u0027ve not even had the courtesy of an acknowledgement.  This has left me in the position of having to threaten to take you to court to make you comply with the basic legal responsibility you have to every member of the party. Mr Woodcock\u0027s lawyers, Hamlins LLP, have also sent a letter to Labour officials demanding they restore integrity to the probe after it was affected by a poisonous atmosphere towards non-Corbyn-backing MPs. The letter claims details of the case were leaked to the media in a co-ordinated campaign to undermine and discredit our client. This obviously raises serious doubt about the integrity of the complaints process with which he was co-operating fully, it adds. The letter goes on to say Ms Formby wants to ditch Blairities while Mr Woodcock has been personally attacked by the general secretary of Unite. In the circumstances, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that person or persons close to this process have set out to cause our client harm, the letter adds.

The Health Secretary was ambushed spectacularly by BBC host Andrew Marr after he claimed a lot of experts have been proved wrong about Brexit. Mr Hunt was trying to back Theresa May\u0027s claim that there will be a \u0027Brexit dividend\u0027 to fund the NHS after Britain leaves the EU. So he was confronted with a quote by one such expert who said it wouldn\u0027t exist. Bullish Mr Hunt was asked if he agreed with the expert, and replied: No. He was then immediately told the expert was, in fact, himself.  Mr Hunt made the original comment in the House of Commons on 6 July 2016 - two weeks after the country voted to leave the EU. At the time he told MPs not to trust claims by Vote Leave, led by Boris Johnson, that Britain could reclaim \u0026pound350million a week of EU budget payments to spend on the NHS. Mr Hunt said in 2016: Even the net figure - the more like \u0026pound100 million net contribution that we make to the EU - is not a figure that we can bank on with any certainty.  Because , even if it did materialise after an exit from the EU, it would be negated by the very smallest of contractions in the economy. [That] would itself reduce the tax base and the amount of public spending available.  Confronted with his quote today, Mr Hunt said he didn\u0027t agree with it. Told it was in fact by him, the flustered Cabinet minister took a couple of seconds to register, then said: I don\u0027t agree with the line of questioning. Mr Marr replied: That\u0027s your own quote!  It comes after PM Theresa May unveiled the health service\u0027s 70th birthday present - \u0026pound20.5billion a year in extra real terms funding by 2024. But claims the 3.4% rise would be funded by a Brexit dividend unravelled after economists and Tory MPs said it did not exist. Mrs May admitted much of the cash will come from higher taxes, yet has not said what those taxes will be. During a testy exchange Mr Hunt refused to guarantee the Tories would keep their pledge to cut corporation tax to 17%. Instead he said all will be revealed within six months at the Budget.

June 21, the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, is the longest day in the year - affording us approximately 17 hours of daylight. Technically, this also means that the nights will start drawing in again now - so there\u0027s really no time like the present to get out and explore the great outdoors on some of the country’s most breathtaking bike rides. We\u0027ve taken a look around the UK to find the best places to watch the sun setting. 1. Museum of Scottish Lighthouses, Fraserburgh, Scotland  A small village called Maud in Aberdeenshire offers a starting place for a traffic-free cycle to the coast. If you\u0027re in the mood to learn then head to the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses in Fraserburgh. The sun will set at around 10.12pm this week in this part of Scotland, so you\u0027ve got loads of time to enjoy the start of the summer. Bike need replacing?   If your existing bike needs replacing, you\u0027ll want something efficient and speedy for the roads - like the Carrera Parva Hybrid bike , which comes in versions for both men and women and is now just \u0026pound210 (a saving of \u0026pound90). And if you don\u0027t need a new bike, why not have yours checked over before setting off. Like any mode of transport your bike needs to be looked after and regularly checked for wear and tear. Halfords offers a 32-point Free Bike Check which includes:  Frame, saddle and handlebar Wheels including tyres, rims, spokes and hubs Brake system including levers, calipers, pads and cables / hoses Drivetrain including gears, levers, chain, bottom bracket, cranks and cables  2. The Eden Project, Cornwall   Why not spend the day enjoying the amazing sights at the Eden Project? Best of all, if you arrive by bike you\u0027ll get a discount on entry. The sun sets on Eden at around 9:30pm on the solstice. Bear in mind though that the Eden Project shuts at 6pm, so you\u0027ll need to watch the sun go down somewhere nearby.  Get there in style on the Carrera Subway 1 Hybrid Bike , \u0026pound300. With easy to use 24 speed Shimano gearing, your effort for building speed will be minimised on all terrains, while its lightweight aluminium frame means you can quickly and efficiently ride to your destination. Camping out?   Planning to camp? Be sure you book in advance as you won\u0027t want to be without a pitch. Croft Farm Holiday Park is just a mile from the Eden Project and three miles from the beach. Pentewan Sands is also nearby and boasts amazing family facilities - as well as the nearby Pentewan Cycle Trail. Consider taking a Halfords Vis A Vis 4 Person Tent with you, which is currently reduced to just \u0026pound60, (was \u0026pound150, save \u0026pound90). The simple tunnel design is easy to pitch in approximately 20 minutes. With two separate bedrooms and a living area, it\u0027s perfect for families or groups of friends. For additional comfort pack an Urban Escape Folding Table And Bench Set , \u0026pound40 (was \u0026pound50, save \u0026pound10) which folds down into a single carry case to make it easy to transport and store.  3. Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales  The Pembrokeshire Coast Path is an absolutely beautiful part of Wales and a stunning place to watch the sun go down. There are loads of campsites in the area, including some unique places to stay. There are plenty of bike routes too, with some offering traffic-free options if you want a more peaceful ride. In Pembrokeshire you can expect the sun to set around 9:39pm. Why not try..   The Boardman ADV 8.8 Adventure Bike , \u0026pound750, is a bike truly made to help you explore new possibilities. This bike is adept at riding in comfort on roads but really excels when you want to get off the beaten track.   4. White Nancy, Cheshire   Located on Kerridge Hill, White Nancy is a local landmark from which you can see all around the area, from Wales to the west and the Pennines to the north. From time to time White Nancy is painted to look like other things, like a Christmas pudding or with Olympic rings when London hosted in 2012. The sun will set over White Nancy at around 9:36 this week. Need to drive?  Heading further afield to enjoy the sunny days? If you\u0027re packing up the whole family into the car for a camping trip, make sure it\u0027s in good running order first. A Free Car Check performed by Halfords experts will put your mind at rest. Book online or just pop in to your local Halfords store and trained colleagues will carry out a free car bulb check and check your battery, wiper blades, engine oil level and air conditioning, and check for any windscreen chips. They\u0027ll even give you a free screenwash top-up too.  If you\u0027re making an unfamiliar journey, don\u0027t forget to get the Garmin Drive Sat Nav , \u0026pound79.99 (was \u0026pound99.99, save \u0026pound20.99). With lifetime map updates you\u0027re never going to find yourself driving down a newly-closed street or down a disused road. 5. Edinburgh Castle, Scotland  There are few places that are as stunning as Edinburgh Castle, located atop Castle Rock. The views of Edinburgh from the castle are amazing, and a great place to watch the end of the day roll around. Sunset here will take place at 9:58pm. 6. Hampstead Heath, London  The scenery on Hampstead Heath always pleases the eye. This amazing part of London has views of every landmark you could hope for and it\u0027s a wonderful place to watch the sun go down. This will happen at around 9:18pm in the capital.   7. Osborne House, Isle of Wight   The home of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert is quite a sight to see. Accessible by bike (and ferry, if you\u0027re not an island resident), it\u0027s the ideal place to see during the day before you settle down somewhere to watch the sunset. If you\u0027re up for the cycle, Shanklin Chine on the west of the island is well worth an evening visit.  Do it with ease - and classic style - on the Pendleton Somerby Electric Hybrid Bike , \u0026pound750. With added electrically powered pedal assistance, it delivers 40 - 50 miles of range through a rear hub motor with speed sensor. This extra power is enough to guarantee effortless rides, taking the strain out of hills and making moving off from a standstill much easier. If you prefer, this bike is also available in a non electric version and in a range of colours - we love the mint green ! The sunset starts at 9:18pm near Osborne House and 9:17pm in Shanklin Chine.  8. Ness Point, Lowestoft    Ness Point is the UK\u0027s most easterly point. This makes it a great place to ride to on National Cycle Route 1. Make yourself comfortable on the Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket , \u0026pound10 (half price) and watch the waves crash in as the sun goes down. Sunset is 9:16 at the UK\u0027s most easterly point.  9. Blackpool Pleasure Beach, Lancashire   With plenty of places to cycle in the area you could have an amazing day out in Blackpool. Start with a ride to the Pleasure Beach, and have some fun with the kids (or without them!) on the roller coasters. When all that\u0027s done you can have fish and chips while the sun sets on another day. The sun will go set at around 9:43 in Blackpool.  10. Cotswolds, England  Spread over six counties there\u0027s a lot to see in the Cotswolds. Consider taking a ride through the picturesque Castle Combe to take in the amazing houses and the stunning market square. The sun sets on this beautiful village at 9:26pm  Find your way by car - and beat the traffic   If you\u0027re driving to somewhere new then why not add a sat nav to your car? The TomTom GO 6200 , \u0026pound270, (was \u0026pound339.99, save \u0026pound69.99) adds real-time traffic information to the navigational benefits of a sat nav (smartphone required for this feature).   11.

Jade Brett-Moore shared the appalling photographs to encourage other victims of domestic violence come forward about the abuse they are suffering, after her ex Daniel McLean was jailed for four years for the countless attacks against her.  The pictures shared by the 23-year-old show how her whole body was subjected to vicious attacks, with McLean even using a deliberately-sharpened end of a metal broom stick to cut at her legs.  She told the Liverpool Echo she was overwhelmed and thankful that McLean had been sentenced.  It was like living with absolute torture and I\u0027m just so glad to be away from it now, she said. It was basically near enough every day for months and months on end. There\u0027s been so many occasions that I couldn\u0027t name them all. She said she wanted other people going through domestic abuse to know they can get the support to free themselves from the violent situation.  I\u0027d say to those out there that right now, whatever place and whatever you\u0027re in, you might see it as being impossible to break free, and while you\u0027re in it you just think there\u0027s no way of ever getting out of it and you\u0027re stuck in that. But no, you\u0027re not. You can break out of it and you can get help and support. It\u0027s important that you must break free of it. No one deserves to go through what they do. McLean once told his partner: I\u0027m going to rape you and throw you in the lake. After one vicious attack, he threatened her: It\u0027ll be me or you that\u0027ll be dead tonight. The brute also threatened to have her gang raped, punched her in the stomach when she was pregnant, said he would throw acid in her face and once used shards from a mirror he had smashed to cut her. Jade, writing after he was sent down last week, said: So this[McLean] is my babies\u0027 father, sadly, who most of you will already know because of his pathetic reputation. Who not only put me through five years, on and off, of hell, but who knew I\u0027d gone through hell with a previous partner who was convicted and justice was served. Really, I should have listened to my family back then and real friends who warned me. But he was adamant he had changed, so I gave it a last shot. I was his victim of abuse and torture.  Not only did I suffer from months of soft tissue damage, fractured ribs, mental torture for things that happened to me which were not my fault - I was slashed and whipped continuously, [suffered] cuts from numerous different objects to my temple, head and body, covered all my legs in black bruising, from top to bottom,.. I couldn\u0027t eat, I was losing weight rapidly and he knew I had an eating disorder... He absolutely destroyed my home I had, phones, TVs, every door, windows, cut all my clothes up, my childrens\u0027 memories destroyed, their belongings and things that meant everything to me. [He] kept me from friends and family, and refused help himself when I tried to get him to the doctor. He wasn\u0027t interested and shut himself away from his family when I tried and tried for him. McLean, of Southport, was jailed last week for four years after admitting two charges of assault and the breach of a restraining order. A new restraining order has been imposed, stopped McLean from contacting Jade for 10 years. A judge described him as a danger to the public and described much of the evidence as harrowing and examples of his obsessive and manipulative behaviour. Jade added: He wouldn\u0027t let me shower on my own or go the toilet on my own, in case I was sneaking someone else in. I wasn\u0027t allowed out anywhere I couldn\u0027t wear make-up or nice clothes because I was a \u0027slag\u0027. He called me anorexic, then said I was fat, always brought me down on how I looked, and that I was unattractive which made me feel so insecure, told me no-one would ever want me because of my life... He also harmed an unborn child by repeatedly punching me to the stomach, where I couldn\u0027t move for weeks, made me miss [pregnancy] appointments, as he was scared they would notice my body full of injuries.

The semi-hard cheese, made from a mixture of goat\u0027s milk and sheep\u0027s milk has become incredibly popular of late, with foodies enjoying everything from halloumi fries to halloumi burgers. As the perfect addition to any grill, the cheese is expected to be a must-have at summer BBQs this year - but shoppers might find it difficult to pick up a pack of the tasty treat.  According to social media users, supermarkets appear to be running out of stock. Twitter user Lauren said: This is going to sound silly but... Is there a shortage of halloumi? Are people panic buying it? I\u0027ve been trying to get hold of some for two weeks and none of the local shops have it in stock... All I want is a salty, cheesy fix! Another wrote: Been to two different shops now and NEITHER had any halloumi is this a joke?? Is there a national shortage???  One person even said they were heartbroken by the thought of Britain running out of the rubbery cheese.  Pittas, one of the main producers of halloumi, told the Mail Online that it is sending emergency supplies across Europe by road to stores that don\u0027t want to wait the usual four weeks it takes to arrive by sea.  Company director John Pittas said: It costs more money to send it that way but Brits love their halloumi. Scientists from the Roslin Institute at Edinburgh University, where Dolly the sheep was cloned, have now gotten involved in the crisis, helping farmers increase their milk production.

We surveyed every local authority to compile the list of shame – the streets that drew the most complaints. Our research was carried out after a study showed roads in Britain are worse than in Chile, Oman and Peru. And they are deadly. Between 2007 and 2016, 22 cyclists were killed and 368 were \u0026shyseriously injured due to crumbling roads, with the victim toll rising. Last year an inquest heard Roger Hamer, 83, died from severe brain \u0026shyinjuries after being flung off his bike when it hit a pothole in Ramsbottom, Greater Manchester.  We found the country’s worst road is Mellor Brook Bypass near Balderstone, Lancs. Motorists and cyclists reported it to the council 545 times in one year. Freedom of Information requests show Seven Hills Road in Elmbridge, Surrey, caused the second highest number of complaints, with 216 reported. Hundreds of drivers signed a petition demanding that the county council resurfaced it. One resident said they had seen FIVE different cars changing tyres at the \u0026shyroadside, adding: “I will be avoiding this road until it is repaired.”  Another motorist said: “Incredibly dangerous trying to avoid huge, deep potholes, having to veer into oncoming traffic. Fed up with damage to my car. “Are they waiting for another needless death? Stop treating us with contempt.” Shocked drivers are hitting potholes and ruining tyres and their cars’ \u0026shysuspensions, steering and underbodies, or losing control and having crashes. Edmund King, the president of the AA, said our investigation shows that right across the country, “our potholed roads are a national disgrace”, and are “fast becoming a national emergency”.  He said: “We are rescuing record numbers of drivers whose vehicles are damaged by potholes. Insurance claims for damage caused by potholes is soaring. “The lack of \u0026shyinvestment on local roads means highway authorities are doing little more than papering over cracks, with drivers picking up the pieces.” He said February’s Beast from the East had made it worse – but was simply exposing years of \u0026shyunderinvestment by cash-strapped councils. In the first four months of 2018, AA Insurance received more pothole claims than in the whole of 2017.  Our probe comes after the Asphalt Industry Alliance revealed 24,500 miles of local roads will need to be shut for repairs in the next year – and it would take at least 14years to clear the backlog, costing \u0026pound9.3billion. A separate report by Cycling UK found local authorities have forked out \u0026pound43.4million in compensation and legal costs due to potholes over the past five years. Sam Jones, of Cycling UK, said: “Before spending \u0026pound15billion on new motorways and trunk roads, let’s fix the roads we use every day and are essential for us to get to work and drop the kids off at school.” National roads are to get 52 times more government funding by 2020 compared to local roads. Councillor Martin Tett, of the LocalGovernment \u0026shyAssociation, said: “Only long-term, consistent and fairer investment in local roads can let councils embark on the improvements so desperately needed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"england fan travels thousands miles","story":"NewsEngland fan travels thousands of miles to Russia for World Cup game against Panama - but leaves his ticket at homeDouglas Moreton believes he forgot to take the tickets from his drawer at home in Bristol\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNadeem Badshah14:51, 24 JUN 2018NewsDan Howells ITV News Editor (left) and an unhappy Douglas in Russia (Image: Twitter)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hapless England football fan from Bristol has travelled thousands of miles to the World Cup in Russia - only to realise he left his ticket in a drawer at home.

Douglas had travelled more than 2,000 miles to stay in a hotel in Volgograd, the Bristol Post reported .

Former school pal and footie team-mate Luke Robinson has \u0026shyrevealed the England skipper – at the time sporting a David Beckham mohican – told him he was going to win the World Cup one day.  Speaking of Harry’s dream ahead of tomorrow’s Panama clash, Luke said: “He loved England and even then one of his biggest dreams was to play for England and win the World Cup. We’d watch the World Cup together and he was always a very proud England fan. “During the 2002 World Cup, Harry had his England shirt with Beckham on the back and the Beckham mohican. “He was so passionate, he was devastated when we went out.”  Luke, 24, was with Harry when he lifted the Essex \u0026amp Waltham Forest District Cup as a 12-year-old in 2006. Now he, like the rest of the \u0026shynation, hopes Harry will lift the coveted FIFA World Cup Trophy on July 15. And teacher Luke said if Harry does win the \u0026shyultimate prize, it will be his proudest \u0026shymoment. He said: “I remember once when Brazil were playing and they had the likes of Ronaldinho, Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos – some of my \u0026shyfavourite players. “I was saying, ‘I’d love to play for Brazil!’. But Harry was like, ‘No, it’s got to be England! I’d love to play for England. That’s the country! That’s the thing!’. He’s that type of guy, England and proud.”  On Harry’s dedication, he said: “Everything was football. If he wasn’t watching football, he was speaking about football, playing football in the park or playing it on the computer. He did well at school and was good at other sports, like cricket, but it was football all day, every day. “In catering class, we had to bring a recipe and make a meal. He’d get a recipe from his chef at Tottenham and cook that so it was healthy. “He’s massive now but at school he was five foot eight or nine, and podgy. He shot up at 16 or 17. He did running and trained three or four times a week. By 16 or 17 he was fit as a fiddle. He put in years of dedication.”  Harry got England off to a flying start last Monday, scoring both goals in a dramatic 2-1 win against Tunisia – and Luke said the display was classic Kane. He said: “Back in school we knew if we needed a goal Harry could always get it. He’s still that sort of player now and the way he popped up with the winner against Tunisia was like back in his schooldays. I don’t see why he can’t win the golden boot.” Harry, 24, leads the line again today against minnows Panama. England’s second Group G game kicks off in Nizhny Novgorod, western Russia, at 1pm our time.  And someone else tipping him to go all the way is Ian Marshall, the chairman of Harry’s first team, Ridgeway Rovers – where Beckham also started out. And he said: “I bet if Harry won the World Cup he’d come back and see us with it. He’s a class act and we’re so proud. For a club like us to have two England captains in Harry and David, it’s something to shout about.” Meanwhile, England is set for a \u0026pound382million party as it cheers on Harry and his boys today.  Retail experts reckon \u0026pound65million will be spent in pubs, cafes and restaurants and \u0026pound151million will go on food and drink at home. Some \u0026pound20million will go on flags and souvenirs, \u0026pound68million on shirts and \u0026pound67million on TVs, website VoucherCodes and the Centre for Retail Research said.  Tesco expects to sell 140 million bottles and cans of beer.

Mark Tewdwr-Jones has sparked a furious debate about where the north-south divide really lies in the UK. The academic has drawn a new map which lumps the northern cities in with London and the Home Counties. Prof Tewdwr-Jones, a professor of town planning, says Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield can’t be classed as northern because they are influenced so much by the capital, the Manchester Evening News reports.   “There are several ways you could define a northern region - but perhaps the most pertinent question is where does London end?” he asks. “My map is a northern area defined as ‘not London,’ where London’s sphere of influence extends over most of the country - determined by two-hour commuting patterns which is becoming the norm.” Professor Tewdwr-Jones, who is chair of town planning at Newcastle University and has advised ministers on planning, land use and housing issues, argues that policymakers should adopt a more ‘nuanced’ view of what constitutes the North.

Cedella Roman, 19, was visiting her mother in Canada when she decided to go for a run along a beach in British Columbia on the evening of May 21.  She told Canadian news network CBC that she veered up onto a dirt path as a the tide starting to come in, before stopping to take a photograph of the view.  But as she turned to head back, she was apprehended by two US Border Patrol officers and told she had illegally crossed into Blaine, Washington. An officer stopped me and started telling me I had crossed the border illegally, she said. I told him I had not done it on purpose, and that I didn\u0027t understand what was happening. Although Roman said she did not see any warning signs that she was approaching the border, she was told by officers that she had been caught on security cameras entering the country.  I said to myself, well I may have crossed the border but they\u0027ll probably only give me a fine or they\u0027ll tell me to go back to Canada and give me a warning. Roman, who had not been carrying any identification on her when she went for the run, was transferred more than 200 kilometres (136 miles) south to the Tacoma Northwest Detention Centre, run by the Department of Homeland Security.  In an interview with CNN , Roman said (in French) that an officer told her maybe you\u0027re going to be deported to your country.  They started taking me to their centre. They put me in their cars with the bars. They took me to their building and asked me to take off my belongings, my jewlery. They searched me everywhere. She was allowed to contact her mother, Christiane Ferne, who brought Roman\u0027s passports and study permits to the detention centre. However, Roman was told she had to present the documents to Immigration Canada to determine if she was allowed to return to Canada, and was held in custody for two weeks before she was told she could go back. Her mother, who visited her several times while she was detained, said: It was just unfair that there was nothing, no sign at the border. It\u0027s like a trap... anybody can be caught at the border like this.

The elections for a new president and parliament pose the biggest challenge to Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted AK Party since they swept to power more than a decade and a half ago. He faces major challenge from Muharrem Ince, the presidential candidate of the secularist Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP), whose feisty performance at campaign rallies has galvanized Turkey\u0027s long-demoralised and divided opposition. The elections will also usher in a powerful new executive presidency long sought by Erdogan and backed by a small majority of Turks in a 2017 referendum. Critics say it will further erode democracy in the NATO member state and entrench one-man rule. Turks began voting this morning at 8am (5.00 GMT), and voting will end at 5pm (14.00 GMT). More than 56 million people were registered to vote at 180,000 ballot boxes across the country.  Erdogan, the most popular but also divisive leader in modern Turkish history, moved the elections forward from November 2019. He argued the new powers would better enable him to tackle the nation\u0027s mounting economic problems, as the lira has lost 20 percent against the dollar this year. Erdogan also argued the powers would help him deal with Kurdish rebels in southeast Turkey and in neighbouring Iraq and Syria. But he reckoned without his rival, Muharrem Ince. Addressing a rally in Istanbul on Saturday, attended by hundreds of thousands of people, Ince promised to reverse what he and opposition parties see as a swing towards authoritarian rule under Erdogan in the country of 81 million people. If Erdogan wins, your phones will continue to be listened to, fear will continue to reign. If Ince wins, the courts will be independent, said Ince, adding he would lift Turkey\u0027s state of emergency within 48 hours of being elected.  Turkey has been under emergency rule - which restricts some personal freedoms and allows the government to bypass parliament with emergency decrees - for nearly two years following an abortive military coup in July 2016. Erdogan blamed the coup on his former ally, US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, and has waged a sweeping crackdown on the preacher\u0027s followers in Turkey. The United Nations say some 160,000 people have been detained and nearly as many more, including teachers, judges and soldiers, sacked. The president\u0027s critics, including the European Union which Turkey still nominally aspires to join, say Erdogan has used the crackdown to stifle dissent. Few newspapers or other media openly criticise the government and he has received far more election coverage than other presidential candidates.  Erdogan, who defends his tough measures as essential for national security, told his supporters at rallies on Saturday that if re-elected he would press ahead with more of the big infrastructure projects that have helped turn Turkey into one of the world\u0027s fastest-growing economies during his time in office. If he wins, I think the obstacles before us will disappear and we will have control, said Nesrin Cuha, 37, a call centre worker, who wore a headscarf. Religiously observant Muslims form the bedrock of Erdogan\u0027s support. The opposition will not be a nuisance anymore with the new presidential system, said another Erdogan supporter, retired sailor Engin Ozmen, 60.

It was, of course, ever thus when predicting what may be in store for a football club.On the pitch, however good the squad may look, successful results can never be taken for granted.The season just ended is an example of that. While it would not be realistic to expect Dundee to finish in the top four, there was reason to believe the players should have been good enough to have mounted a serious challenge to make the Premiership’s top six.That they didn’t was disappointing but, despite some complaint about that, the reality of a club the size of Dundee is that any campaign that ends with them still in the top division has to be acceptable.The hope has to be that, with the right additions, next term will see that top-six challenge materialise.If it does, it can become a regular occurrence.As for the new stadium, it goes back to that phrase – seeing will be believing.The plans are impressive and the feeling the best bet for the future is to move away from Dens, home for the last 119 years but now ageing and in many ways impractical, is a sensible one.But the aim was the first spade would be in the ground at what’s been dubbed “Nou Campy” just north of the Kingsway and adjacent to Camperdown Park at some point this summer.Yes, there’s another couple of months to go before that becomes a false promise but, with no final planning permission in place as yet, time is running out.Of course, even if that’s what comes to pass, it doesn’t mean the stadium won’t be built.As we’ve seen up the coast at Aberdeen, such projects can be delayed, delayed and delayed again.If Nou Campy never gets off the ground, it doesn’t have to follow the club will be plunged into the latest of what down the years have been many crises.For many fans, wherever the team is playing, so long as it continues to be backed by the Keyes cash and is riding high in the Premiership, that bright future will have arrived.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2a29b42d531-435x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc four of the very best to have pulled on dark blue","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor what is a mid-sized club by Scottish standards, over their history it’s fair to say Dundee have punched well above their weight when it comes to producing and attracting top talent.In today\u0026#8217s look down memory lane, as we celebrate their 125th birthday, we highlight the very best of what has been a quality crop.Billy Steel: However long there is a Dundee FC, no list of the club’s greatest performers will ever be complete without the name Billy Steel.When director/manager George Anderson snapped the Scottish international inside-forward up from Derby County for a record £22,500 in September 1950, it went down as one of the transfer coups of the decade.Regarded as world class but known for being difficult to manage, Steel repaid the faith Anderson had shown in him and, in the next four years, would inspire Dundee to two League Cups.Steel left Dens in 1954 when he quit the senior game aged just 31. He moved to America where he died in 1982 but, 36 years later, remains regarded as one of Scotland’s greatest players.Claudio Caniggia: It was a case of 1950 and Billy Steel all over again when, in October 2000, Dundee sent tremors through the football world by announcing the signing of Argentine World Cup star Claudio Caniggia.In desperate need of a replacement for injured striker Fabian Caballero, the Dee’s Italian manager Ivano Bonetti used his Serie A connections and fixed up Caniggia, a former Roma team-mate of his brother and assistant Dario.In the end, the man who was Diego Maradona’s favourite strike partner for Argentina did not stay long at Dens Park, making just 21 league appearances and scoring seven goals, before heading for Rangers at the end of the 2000/01 campaign.Both for his performances and the gentlemanly way he conducted himself off the park, the impact he had on Dundee was considerably greater than the time he spent at Dens Park.Alan Gilzean: If there’s a debate over who the best-ever Dundee player is, when to comes to putting the ball in the net there can be no argument.Although down the years the club can boast some prolific scorers, there never has been, and is never likely to be, anyone who could match the ability of the legendary Alan Gilzean.Over 40 years after his playing career with the Dark Blues and then Spurs came to an end, those who saw him or played with or against him still regard him as being a world class centre-forward.Born in Coupar Angus, Dundee were his first senior club. He score an unequalled total of 169 goals for them and won the league in 1961/62 before being transferred to Spurs, where he enjoys similar legendary status, in 1964.Doug Cowie: The sands of time mean in some ways he is the forgotten man of Dundee greats but never to those who saw or played alongside Doug Cowie.Signed by George Anderson in 1945, over the next 16 years the Aberdonian would make a record 446 appearances, win two League Cups and also appear in two World Cups for Scotland.Cowie left Dens at the end of the season before the club won the championship but many of those who played in the side that clinched the title have often referred to the influence he had over their development on the pitch.As well as nurture it, Cowie would go on to show himself as an adept talent spotter. Once his playing days were over he worked for Dundee United and, along with fellow-scout Davie Small, was credited by Jim McLean as being instrumental in unearthing many of the local players who went on to bring the league flag to Tannadice in 1983.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.741936.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc humble claudio caniggia was even better off pitch barry smith","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee legend in his own right, Barry Smith captained the club for nine years before returning as manager in 2010.During that time he saw some of the best and some of the worst times in the history of the club.Among the best, however, was playing alongside some top-quality team-mates.And one name that stands out is Claudio Caniggia.Barry said: “I grew up watching guys like him play in World Cups, so I feel really fortunate to have played with Caniggia.“What made him stand out is, no matter how much he had done in the game before, he was so humble and had great humility.“What stood out for me is how he took time to help out the younger lads in training. Guys like Steven Milne and Graham Bayne owe a lot to him.“That was just the type of guy he is, very humble, no airs and graces and he took a lot of time with younger players that a lot of other players wouldn’t.“The first time he came in, he immediately made sure he was part of the team.“He didn’t just stand around, he got involved straight away.“Claudio didn’t want to be a superstar or anything, just wanted to be part of a team.

However, the one time they met them in a final they ran out 1-0 winners in December 1973.Jocky said: “The team that won the League Cup was a very good side.“Unfortunately, we couldn’t do more in the Scottish Cup because we kept meeting Celtic in the semi-final – we just couldn’t beat them.“When Rangers and Celtic are dominant, it’s very difficult. You’ve got to catch them on a bad day or get them in a final where you are on a hiding to nothing and just go out and play.“A semi-final is the worst game of all.“You’re within touching distance of the final but you’re not there yet.“Some players don’t handle that too well but then can handle a final.“Around 1973, we’d played Celtic in a few semi-finals and they were all very close games.“We were never really hammered in any of them but they just had that wee bit more experience of playing in semi-finals and winning them.“We had experience of losing semi-finals.“Psychologically that’s a big thing, whereas when you get to a final it’s different.“We were, obviously, the underdogs – with that there’s nothing to lose, just go out and play, do your best and hope it’s good enough.“You need wee breaks, too, and we got them.”In the midst of the miner’s strike, the 1973 final was an eerie affair with just 27,974 spectators braving the snowy conditions.Striker Gordon Wallace got the all-important goal late on to secure the trophy for the Dark Blues.Scott added: “Rab Wilson played it up to Gordon Wallace.“He had Pat McCluskey at his back but he took it down on his chest and in one movement hit it low into the corner.“The goalie was taken by surprise with the quickness Gordon hit it.“It was a typical striker’s goal, instinctive, didn’t think – bang.“We scored and went ahead – I don’t think we did that in any of the semi-finals we played, we were always having to fight back. We scored first and had something to build on.“It wasn’t like we scored and sat back and defended for 60 minutes or we were fortunate or anything.“We’d had a go at them, played well in defence and attack. It wasn’t a smash-and-grab win, we deserved it.“We were good enough to go on and win more trophies but, unfortunately, we didn’t. It was a good side with good players, individually and collectively.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b715bb7ee0-788x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc the big days in dark blues history books","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most provincial clubs, for Dundee, trophies are a welcome bonus, not a given.In their 125-year history, the Dark Blues have lifted major domestic silverware on five occasions, though not since their League Cup win of 1973.Their first success came 17 years after the club was formed, in the shape of the 1910 Scottish Cup – the only time they’ve lifted the country’s most prestigious knockout trophy.In typical fashion, the one time Dundee did win it, it was the hard way.The first round saw them held by Beith, technically away from home but actually at Dens Park after the opposition surrendered home advantage, before winning the replay 1-0.A crowd of 20,000 then saw them take care of Falkirk at the first time of asking and it was the same with Motherwell in the third round.In the semi-finals they needed three games before beating Hibs by the only goal of the entire tie at Parkhead.That set up what was to be an epic final against Clyde, the side who would finish just above them in the First Division that season.Game one of an Ibrox triple header ended in a 2-2 draw on April 9 and, when the teams met again seven days later, there was no scoring.Dundee were finally able to kiss silver for the first time on April 20, 1910, when goals from Jimmy Bellamy and John ‘Sailor’ Hunter saw them edge out the Bully Wee by 2-1.That sparked off wild celebrations and although that second replay was a midweek game, the team were mobbed when they arrived back home by train late in the evening.Despite a few near things, it was to be 41 years before the fans were able to welcome another trophy to the city.That was when the side put together by director/manager George Anderson, and that was inspired by Scotland inside- forward Billy Steel, went all the way in the League Cup.Having edged out Hearts in the group stage, they beat Falkirk 2-1 over the two legs of the quarter-finals. A one-sided 5-1 success over Motherwell at Ibrox in the last four set up a clash with Rangers at Hampden. The Gers were favourites but this was a Dundee side that feared no one. They showed that with a 3-2 victory.After failing to live up to being favourites when they faced Motherwell in the Scottish Cup Final later that season, the next campaign saw them again win the League Cup.This time they cruised a group made up of Clyde, Raith and Airdrie and, although they lost the first leg in the quarters against Stirling Albion 3-1, back at Dens a 5-0 success saw them through.Hibs were then taken care of in the semis and the final against Kilmarnock was a fairly routine affair, a Bobby Flavell double being enough retain the trophy.Nine years later came Dundee’s most glorious day when, under the guidance of Bob Shankly, a fantastic season was crowned by clinching the club’s only league title.It came at Muirton Park, where a 3-0 win over St Johnstone – who were relegated – saw them beat off the challenge of Rangers in what, until that final day, had been a nip-and-tuck race.The league was won with the use of just 15 players, though with the likes of Alan Gilzean, Alex Hamilton, Ian Ure, Andy Penman and skipper Bobby Cox in the line-up, it was a special team.It was back to the League Cup for the last major success and, if the 1973 triumph is not the most talked about of the five, it was a laudable achievement. It came during the time of the three-day week and power cuts, meaning the final had an early kick-off to save power, so attracted a crowd of just 27,974.The game was decided by a solitary late goal from the prolific Gordon Wallace and if many reports make it sound forgettable, it should be remembered victory was over a Hoops side that would go on to reach the European Cup semi-finals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/976302492.jpg-279x180.jpg ","title":"argentina cant expect messi to carry them says dundee hero caniggia","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee star Claudio Caniggia has urged the current Argentina side not to be a one-man team in Russia this summer.The Argentines got their World Cup campaign under way on Saturday against Iceland but could only manage a draw.Today they face Croatia and will hope to kick-start their campaign.Caniggia went to three World Cups – almost returning for a fourth at the age of 42 in 2010 – and arrived to much fanfare at Dundee in 2000.He says his country’s best chance of winning it all for the first time since 1986 is if Lionel Messi’s supporting cast step up to the plate.The 51-year-old rose to international prominence during the 1990 World Cup in Italy alongside Argentina great Diego Maradona and insists the difference between that side and today’s is the expectation on the other players.Caniggia said: “Messi doesn’t get the same support from his team-mates Maradona did.“I knew Maradona was the complete footballing genius but I didn’t think about keeping up with him. Never.“Every player has a responsibility, even those who don’t play much.“You can’t give all the responsibility to Messi, because then what’s the point of you being there?“Imagine if I’d thought in 1990 the world champions had to carry me through. No! Carry us? We’re in it together.“I’m Argentina’s striker and I have to drag them through it, too.“That was my responsibility. You’ve got to have character, determination, ambition and impulse.”Argentina are fifth in the betting to lift the trophy and Caniggia believes they can do it, particularly with the talent they have up top.With Messi, Gonzalo Higuain – who has come under fire for his performances for his country – Sergio Aguero, Paulo Dybala and Angel Di Maria to choose from, goals shouldn’t be a problem. Defensively, however, they could come unstuck.“What’s in our favour is the best attacking players can put fear into anyone,” added Caniggia.“Their names alone unsettle the opposition. The other teams don’t think ‘Higuain is being criticised in Argentina’. They think: ‘he’s Juventus’ top goalscorer’.”“Our weak point is we’re still not solid at the back, and there are still a couple of places up for grabs.”Caniggia was in his early thirties by the time he arrived at Dens Park in 2000 and remarkably had the chance to play at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.“We’ll never know now but to play 30 minutes would have been perfect. I was in good shape and I hadn’t lost my pace. But I couldn’t decide, and later I regretted it. It would’ve been unbelievable to play.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"convincing players to come to dundee united has not been easy admits csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo admits getting the players he wants to rebuild Dundee United this summer has not been easy.But he’s revealed the more quality signings that have been made, the less difficult the process has become.With other clubs, often from top divisions, also keen on players like Callum Booth, Craig Curran and Frederic Frans, the Tangerines had to pull out the stops to persuade them to sign up at Tannadice.That saw Csaba making a point of speaking to every potential target individually, rather than doing business through their agents.“If we are in the Premiership it is easier to attract staff and players, but we are not,” he said.“I have talked to every single player we have signed to convince them to come to Dundee United.“It was not an agent calling them to tell them Dundee United were interested, it was the manager calling to say you are important.“I think this was a reason why we’ve got players. It’s a lot of work and it’s not finished.“Frans and Booth both had offers from Premiership clubs here, Frans also from the top division in Belgium.“They have come here and, when other players see that, it made it better for us to get others to come as well.”Csaba has also revealed not one of the new faces had a problem with the new 25-miles rule he’s introduced.From now on, every player will have to stay no further away from Tannadice than that and, contrary to what some predicted, it’s not been a problem.“Before it could be Willo Flood, myself and some directors travelling on the team

Ewing, has now spoken out in support of the Transport (Scotland) Bill which is currently making its way through Holyrood, saying it promises \"radical measures\" to improve accessibility and prohibit obstructive parking.\"Inconsistent and obstructive parking is a nuisance in our communities and greatly impacts on our ability to easily get around by foot, and so it is critical we empower local authorities to tackle this important issue,\" he said.Today a coalition of disability and mobility organisations called on Highland Council to develop an Inverness Street Charter, setting out measures to improve accessibility.Produced by the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in liaison with Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and Highland Cycle Campaign among others their \"manifesto\" \u0026ndash Putting Inverness Streets Ahead \u0026ndash identifies pavement parking along with other issues such as street clutter and shared spaces for vehicles and pedestrians as restricting safe access.RNIB campaigns manager Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality of life for residents and, vitally, boost the reputation of Inverness as an open and welcoming tourist destination.\"Elsewhere, after wheelchair user David Sansum, from Kinmylies, branded the parking situation in Inverness \"a nightmare\" in last week\u0027 HN others have taken to social media to share their own frustrations.On Facebook Paul Tuthill said: \"As a powerchair user I find this

providing parking as part of new residential developments.Speaking about the situation in his own street he said: \"I may also add everyone parks on one side of the pavement, leaving the other side

National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in collaboration with groups including Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and the Highland Cycle Campaign.It sets out a range of barriers it says prevents Inverness being truly accessible to all, including too many bollards of different types and heights, unfenced cafe tables and chairs spilling into pavement areas and refuse bins on narrow pavements forcing pedestrians onto the road.The coalition want the council to adopt a Street Charter which would dictate conditions to be applied to any future planning or licensing applications.RNIB Scotland campaigns manager Dr Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality

welcoming to everyone \u0026ndash and the key to inclusivity is physical accessibility.\"She added: \"A Street Charter would help to avoid entrenching flawed designs that could blemish Inverness for a generation or more.\"Brian MacKenzie of the Highland Cycle Campaign said\u0026nbsp the drive to get things right first time made good financial sense for cash-strapped local authorities.\"For example, a 2015 House of Lords report on \u0026lsquoshared spaces\u0026rsquo (where roads and pavements are levelled allowing vehicles and pedestrians to use the same area) warns that \u0026lsquocouncils are risking public safety with fashionable simplified street design\u0026rsquo and notes that \u0026lsquomore and more local authorities are forced into expensive remedial work, often restoring crossings they have themselves removed\u0026rsquo,\" he said.The manifesto states: \"A Street Charter would offer planners and consultants a template for inclusive design, potentially saving the council money by cutting down on objections to plans or completed developments.\"And it adds: \"A Street Charter would also make for a more pleasant environment for people who don\u0026rsquot have disabilities as clutter-free streets and logical street layouts would make getting around easier and more appealing.\"Highland Council introduced a new policy in April, requiring trade waste bins to be kept off city

It will recover the costs later.In March it also ordered building owners with glazed canopies to check they had adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements in place.This followed incidents at both the Inverness and Inshes retail parks in 2017 and earlier this year where panels fell from their fixings, in one case resulting in a shopper having stitches to his head after being hit with broken glass.Mr Stewart said: \"Although councils can act if buildings are deemed dangerous and go on to recoup money from owners if they carry out work, there\u0027 more that can be done to bring in more preventative measures.\"Businesses are under severe pressure at the moment with rising city centre costs.

support this charity, ever since we held our first fundraising event last autumn at Kintore Parish Church.“I am delighted that the younger generation are supporting the Toilet Twinning Re-vo-loo-tion! So many of us take clean water and toilet facilities for granted.“This initiative helps to raise funds to help people around the world.”Seren Boyd, Toilet Twinning’s media and public relations spokeswoman, said: “We have quite a lot of young people who are really inspired by the fact that people in the world don’t have access to a toilet.“Children tend to have a real sense of injustice and the fact that one in three people doesn’t have a toilet to use really speaks to them.“However, for a nine-year-old to take on such a huge challenge for us on his own is really very moving.“It’s very touching when a child goes above and beyond for us. Fraser is an absolute star.“17 miles is a long way – especially for a nine-year-old.”Seren said Fraser’s exhausting challenge would be supporting a great cause.She said: “Having access to a toilet is so important and fundamental to life.“It often represents taking the first big step out of poverty.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/EE1_0590-475x564.jpg ","title":"game of thrones stars expected to jet into aberdeen for wedding of kit harington and rose leslie4","story":"\t\t\t\t\tGame of Thrones cast members have started to arrive in Aberdeen for the highly-anticipated wedding of two of the show\u0026#8217s stars.Kit Harington and Rose Leslie are expected to get married at Wardhill Castle tomorrow.Peter Dinklage, who plays Tyrion Lannister, arrived in Aberdeen from Belfast along with producer D.B Weiss shortly after 1pm.And co-star Emilia Clarke, who plays Daenerys of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, The Unburnt, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men, Queen of Meereen, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Protector of the Realm, Lady Regnant of the Seven Kingdoms, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, arrived shortly after from Heathrow.Other stars from the hit HBO series including Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams, who plays Sansa and Arya Stark are expected to arrive at today.Swedish-Canadian actress Malin Akerman and actor-fiance Jack Donnelly were also pictured arriving at the airport.The couple met during filming for the show and announced their engagement last September with a notice in the times.And last month it was revealed the couple will be wedding in the north-east after a notice was posted at the registration office in Huntly.Rose shot to fame playing housemaid Gwen Dawson in Downtown Abbey before appearing as wildlingYgritte in GoT.She went to primary school in Rayne before attending boarding school in England and then the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.Londoner Harington has earned legions of fans as noble Jon Snow in the hit series and was spotted at the Leslie family\u0026#8217s property in December helping sell Christmas trees.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"new council policy aiming to get citys children out to play","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCouncil chiefs have launched a new policy as part of a bid to encourage Aberdeen youngsters to play outside.Aberdeen City Council’s Play Policy and Strategy was kicked off with a Play for Today event at Westburn Park.The launch included a number of activities for school pupils to celebrate both the policy and the longest day of the year.It was approved by councillors in January.Since 2013 the council has invested £3.3 million into the refurbishment and redevelopment of 101 city play areas.At the event yesterday, John Wheeler, convener of education operational delivery, said: “What we are underlining is Aberdeen City Council’s commitment to encouraging children to play.“We have invested millions of pounds in refurbishments of parks and play areas and we are keen to emphasise the importance of playing.“In recent times there has been a turn towards children tending to stay inside and we want to encourage children to go outside.“We are also in control of the spaces where children play so we have a responsibility to give them the best tools.“What we need to do is encourage play – for example by taking down the ‘no ball games’ signs in green spaces.“In terms of social development ensuring that children have time to play is essential.”He added: “Our updated policy comes at a time when we have committed £100,000 to our Year of Young People celebrations which sees young individuals and youth organisations in the city delivering a range of fantastic cultural projects.“As many people will know, we are well on our way to becoming a Unicef Child Friendly City. The new play policy is a lynchpin in achieving that hugely important ambition.”Also taking part in the event were the council’s Imagineers – a group of children who are part of Aberdeen’s Children’s Parliament – who organised game playing. During the launch, pupils from Cornhill School kicked off their 24-Hour Glitter Pick as part of the Clean Up Aberdeen Initiative.Council co-leader Jenny Laing hailed the policy as emphasising the administration’s commitment to giving children play opportunities. She said: “Since 2012 we have made a commitment to improving young people’s lives – play is a major way of doing that.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cygnets disappear from tarbert harbour","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 24/06/18, 7:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert residents are worried about the family of swans living in the harbour.Six cygnets were seen in late May, shortly after hatching, but reports on social media have them slowly dwindling.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girl 4 stuck playpark equipment","story":"NewsGirl, 4, gets stuck in playpark equipment and needs fire brigade to rescue herPetrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle near Ayr.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley16:44, 20 JUN 2018Updated19:45, 20 JUN 2018NewsLittle Lily-Mags had her leg stuck in the toy car for 40 minutes\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old girl got stuck in playpark equipment for 40 minutes as firefighters struggled to get access to her. Petrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle. Her father David and other parents were unable to free her, sparking an emergency services rescue. But crews faced a major delay as access to the park through the main entrance was blocked off due to fencing at the Belleisle Hotel. The crew had to abandon their fire engine some distance away and run across the grass to reach Lily-Mags. After assessing the situation, they were forced to backtrack their appliance through the main exit and find another way in.  Mum Clare said: “Luckily my daughter wasn’t badly hurt, but if it was a life-or-death situation and a child had fallen from equipment it may have been too late.” Clare, who was working from home outside Ayr, rushed to the park after her husband phoned. Clare, 33, said: “I drove in a panic. “Her leg was wedged in the car at a funny angle. “I could hear her screaming over the phone. My husband and others tried to get her out but it hurt so they called the fire brigade.” Firefighters calmly cut off the side of the car to free the tot.  She emerged unscathed but with bad pins and needles during the incident a week past last Wednesday. Now Clare and Lily-Mag’s gran Anita O’Connor are calling for an emergency services route to the wooded park. Clare said: “The fire service were really fantastic but it took them 10 minutes to figure out how to get the fire engine in.” Anita said: “She was stuck for well over 40 minutes as the fire engine couldn’t find a route through to the park because of the fencing. “Fortunately she has not sustained any injuries, but she is extremely traumatised. “This issue regarding access needs to be addressed ASAP and not sat on for days until the council have their next meeting.”  Belleisle Hotel owner Campbell Inns erected more fencing on June 6, which has blocked off access to the playpark through the main driveway. The alternative entrance is now through Greenfield Avenue. Anita said emergency services should have been notified of the issue. A council spokesman said: Due to layout changes affecting the main access road at Belleisle, emergency services had to enter via an alternate route. “We are contacting the emergency services to advise them to use the alternative entrance for the time being.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"pair young lads saved squirrel","story":"NewsPair of young lads saved squirrel that was lying in agonyNow the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston10:10, 21 JUN 2018NewsMax Bryson, left and Ben Edwards (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA squirrel lay in agony after plunging from a tree in a park ... only to be protected and saved by two young lads. Now the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers. And Ben’s dad James said: “I am immensely proud of them both. “Too often people these days would just walk past and, although concerned, would not intervene. “Ben and Max got stuck in and worked out a rescue plan.” The 12-year-olds, who have just started second year at Kyle Academy, had been out cycling in Rozelle Park last Tuesday.  They came across the bashed-up critter at the side of the duck pond and sprang into action. Onlooker Lorna Barclay said the boys deserve recognition. She said: “The squirrel was obviously hurt and fretting on the path. “We approached to see if we could help but were pleasantly surprised they had the situation under control.” They had already called the SSPCA and protected the frightened furry animal from dogs. When the charity said they’d be an hour the boys went home and got a strong bag filled with straw - leaving Lorna on guard.  And Max’s mum Liz and dad Douglas, who own the Inverlea Guest House in Ayr, said: “He loves animals so wanted to help. “I am so happy both boys decided to intervene. “They did it all on their own and I knew nothing about it. “What the lady said about the boys was amazing.” The lads returned to the squirrel within 15 minutes with their custom-made bed all ready for the SSPCA inspector. Lorna added: “It was lovely to see how concerned and compassionate the boys as well as using their problem- solving skills.  “Many other people would have walked on by without any interest in helping.” Ben already has a busy household with dad James, mum Sarah, sisters Lizzie and Emily, two cats, a tortoise and a fish. Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: “At this time of year we receive a lot of calls about people concerned about wildlife. “We all have a responsibility to look after and care for the wildlife in Scotland and these two boys went above and beyond on this occasion to help this poor squirrel. “They should be very proud.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"WATCH  Riders fording the River Ettrick at Selkirk Common Riding","story":"WE\u0027VE been out to soak up the Common Riding Celebrations in Selkirk

of schedule.\nThe B-listed 250 year old crossing, which links Galashiels and Melrose, was closed for 20 weeks between January 31 and June 15 for an essential and major repair and strengthening programme.\nDespite the early stages of the project taking place during the most extreme winter weather seen in recent years, the bridge reopened before the start of Melrose Festival Week.\nExtensive masonry repair works have taken place during this time which required significant scaffolding to be in place for a number of weeks, resurfacing of the road surface on and around the bridge has been carried out and the traffic light system upgraded.\nAll these works, which have been carried out by Borders contractors, also mean that Lowood Bridge\u0026rsquos 26 tonne weight limit has been removed, leaving all vehicles able to use the crossing.\nOver the first few days motorists are asked to drive carefully as they get used to travelling over the bridge once again.\nBus services which used the crossing before it closed will also return to using the B6374 road on Saturday, June 16.\nScottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, councillor Gordon

Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest.\nOn Friday morning the 26-year-old joiner led his town with both authority and calmness as Souters celebrated and honoured their historic traditions.\nYet the countdown couldn\u0027t have been more nerve-racking or distracting.\nDelays in Selkirk town centre renovations meant a reshuffle of vantage points for the iconic Casting of the Colours ceremony.\nAnd on the eve of the Common Riding itself, Storm Hector rampaged through the Royal Burgh tearing down bunting and leaving a trail of destruction and debris.\nIf the build-up wasn\u0027t distracting enough, a thoughtless thug spent the Nicht Afore the Morn spray-painting graffiti on landmarks including the War Memorial.\nBut just a few hours later the 2018 Standard Bearer remained the picture of calm as the sun gently rose on Friday morning.\nThe weather had relented, the debris had been cleared, the bunting had been restrung, and the vandalism was covered.\nAnd as Souters frae a\u0027 the airts linked arms and belted out the songs they\u0027d learned as children, all the woes were soon forgotten.\nSelkirk shone as it always does on Common Riding morning.\nAfter returning the Burgh Flag, Standard Bearer Forrest told us: \"I have been calm all week and even managed to get a good three hours\u0027 sleep last night.\n\"I\u0027m not sure how I manage it, but I don\u0027t get nervous at all, and despite everything that has happened, for me the Common Riding couldn\u0027t have gone any better.\n\"I\u0027ve loved the build up and I have loved every second of being Standard Bearer - I don\u0027t think the smile has left my face since the minute I got up this morning.\"\nWhether it was the four years he served as an Attendant - behind James Cheyne in 2009, Douglas Gunn in 2010, Gavin Henderson in 2012 and Kieran Riddle in 2017 - that equipped Peter for taking his duties in his stride, we\u0027ll never know.\nBut his composure and welcoming smile wasn\u0027t lost on any of the dignitaries around him.\nHonorary Provost Jake Wheelans said: \"After all the bad weather and everything else it was great to have Peter as our Standard Bearer.\n\"He was impeccable in every part of his duties today, and he upheld all of our traditions as a Standard Bearer should.\n\"Selkirk has enjoyed a tremendous Common Riding with a fantastic Standard Bearer.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Keep calm - it  39 s only the Common Riding","story":"THE calming influence of Standard Bearer Peter Forrest made sure Selkirk Common Riding ran like clockwork on Friday.\nJust hours after Storm Hector had ripped through the region, Souters awoke to a serene and surprisingly relaxed morning.\nAnd about to head their day-long celebrations was to be the most relaxed of them all - Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does. Coming in at The Toll was unbelievable and the Casting was something that will live with me forever.\n\"It has been a truly amazing day and I\u0027d like to thank everyone who came out and supported me.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Casting their places in history","story":"SELKIRK Common Riding is undoubtedly a festival steeped in tradition and commemoration.\nBut it is also a day of contrasts for the followers as well as the ones lucky enough to take part.\nFrom the high-adrenaline riders returning at the Toll, the ecstasy and elation is quietly absorbed by reflection and respect as the colourful procession heads into town.\nBeneath silver skies the rearranged scarlet plinth within the Market Place awaited not only Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest, but the six accompanying Standard Bearers selected by the town\u0026rsquos ancient Societies and Associations.\nTo the growing thrum of expectation, as the hidden clock ticked past eleven, all seven gathered beneath the steps to await a brief minute or two that will live with them forever.\nSince the tragic cast of a blood-soaked English banner more than 500 years ago, this re-enactment both commemorates and celebrates, defiance and pride in equal measure.\nAnd as the Silver Band leads the way with Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters, each Standard Bearer in turn re-enacts and relives this defiant and proud act.\nStandard Bearer Forrest, as he had been all morning, was assured and relaxed as he turned the Royal Burgh Standard above his head.\nIt was as deserved a cheer as any Standard Bearer has received as he smiled, waved and made his way from the gaze of five-thousand eyes.\nCollege lecturer Mark Easson \u0026ndash a painter by trade \u0026ndash resumed where Standard Bearer Forrest had left off. Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"New route planned for tonight s Melrosian s rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people.

Aly was responsible for the huge flash mob \u0026lsquoDancing in the Street\u0026rsquo event last year, involving the whole community.\nShe told us: \"Whilst singing is at the heart of everything that InChorus has achieved over the last 10 years, it\u0026rsquos never been only that.\n\"Through this organisation we have seen people\u0026rsquos friendships, confidence, skills, self-esteem and both emotional and physical health all flourish and grow over the years.\n\"In return the members give their time freely and generously to learn, rehearse and perform music for the benefit of others.\n\"In its time InChorus has achieved and given so much more than any of us really ever anticipated at the outset and I think every member feels so proud about that.\nIt\u0026rsquos amazing what a community can achieve when they group together, take a collective breath and burst into song.\"\nThey say that into every life a little rain must fall, and InChorus has not escaped, losing three much loved ladies to cancer.\nIn 2016 it was founder members Kitty Lyle and Celia Hayton and, just a few weeks ago, Bernice Brown - all are missed greatly.\nThroughout its 10 years the choir has raised over \u0026pound60,000 for other charities, both through its own concerts and through specific charity events.\nThis is something that is at the core of InChorus, something of which they are proud, and something which will continue in the years to come.\nAt one charity dinner they even put up an InChorus performance as an auction prize and were \u0026lsquosold\u0026rsquo for over \u0026pound1100. This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"United front to boost the Borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year. Views were sought on the Borderlands\u0026rsquo key themes: Digital Energy Destination Borderlands Rural Productivity Business Growth Transport Innovation and Skills and Quality of Place.\nThe conference had backing from both governments who have pledged support for a deal.\nKeith Brown MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work, said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government has made clear our support for a proposed Borderlands deal in our budget statements.

Unless we act they will continue to suck up our young talent and skills.\n\u0026ldquoWe need to re-position ourselves, we need to stabilise and to stop our productivity falling and then we also need to reinvent. This feels like a once in a generation opportunity.\n\u0026ldquoWe know our potential, our children will not forgive us if there are no jobs in the future.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.    I genuinely don\u0026rsquot know what to do now. #Oscar2018 pic.twitter/lfXWlFBCj9  The Silent Child beat four contenders to the award: DeKalb Elementary, The Eleven O\u0026rsquoClock,\u0026nbspMy Nephew Emmett and Watu Wote/All of Us.  The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

Dean Conner, 33, of Links Avenue, has been handed an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) following an application by East Lothian Council.  The court was presented with details of the alleged anti-social behaviour of Mr Conner, including shouting, swearing and fighting within a property at Links Avenue, and disposing of items and bags of rubbish outwith a domestic bin within the communal garden.  The terms of the ASBO prohibit Mr Conner from behaving in an anti-social manner including shouting and swearing at neighbours and other residents in and around Links Avenue.  He is also banned from having more than two visitors to his property at any one time except those who are there in the course of their employment.  Mr Conner had received an interim ASBO earlier this year.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThere is a significant history of anti-social behaviour complaints made against Mr Conner which has caused considerable alarm and distress to others.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, with the full support of Police Scotland, will take the strongest possible action against those who behave in an anti-social fashion.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans. He said: \u0026ldquoI wasn\u0026rsquot involved in the D-Day landings the people that were are the heroes."},{"url":null,"title":"IN PICTURES  Musselburgh Gala","story":"              MUSSELBURGH Gala proved a big success as it took place on Saturday.

Plans to close Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School were revealed last autumn.  East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.  Current headteacher Seonaid McGillivray is set to be appointed at another as yet unnamed school in the county, with the final details expected to be tied up within a matter of days.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe that the decision to establish one new primary school, operating under a single management structure, offers the best solution to not only developing a stronger and more cohesive curriculum, but that local children will benefit from improved progression planning and transition as they progress from infant to upper stage.  \u0026ldquoOur education service will work closely with our current headteacher Mrs McGillivray, and the chairs of both parent councils, to recruit a headteacher for the newly established school.  She added: \u0026ldquoI would like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs McGillivray for her service and leadership of King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School and more recently Haddington Infant School.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees.

Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Inspectors found the following strengths in the school\u0027s work:  - Strong relationships exist between staff and children across the school and nursery which are based on shared values  - In the nursery, children are motivated and confident, and are able to make choices about their play, particularly outdoors. Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children. Wellbeing is central to the whole school community and staff provide a nurturing learning environment where children receive effective support.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Phonebox removed from centre of Haddington","story":"              A TRADITIONAL red phonebox has been removed from the centre of Haddington after it was used just once in a year.

Colin Beattie\u0027s comments follows a \"positive meeting\" with health bosses in the wake of patients\u0027 concerns about the service at the enlarged practice in the Musselburgh Primary Care Centre.  The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.  Mr Beattie said: \"There is no doubt that there are issues around patients\u0026rsquo communication with the surgery, particularly at peak times. I was pleased that the surgery has recognised this and was in a position to give me a briefing on the situation.\"  He said doctors were now up to their full staffing level of 14 and an additional four staff members to take phone calls were in the process of being recruited.  During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7964459.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"EU nations try to resolve differences over migration","story":"              The leaders of Germany, France and several other European Union nations are meeting in Brussels for an informal talks on differences over migration policy.  Facing a domestic political crisis in Germany over the topic, Chancellor Angela Merkel will be seeking to get EU leaders to forge a joint approach to manage the influx of migrants and refugees, a divisive issue which is now back at the heart of the EU too.  There are deep divisions over who should take responsibility for arriving migrants, how long they should be required to accommodate them, and what should be done to help those EU countries hardest hit like Italy and Greece.

Looking for common ground among a few key nations, the informal mini-summit now involves about 16 member states, as others demanded to take part.  And to further complicate matters, four eastern EU countries \u0026mdash the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia \u0026mdash refused to attend and reject taking in migrants in general.  It means that whatever is agreed upon, it would still face a full test when the full two-day EU summit starts on Thursday.  Two issues have brought the crisis back to haunt the leaders: In Germany, Christian Democrat coalition partners CDU and CSU are haggling over the right approach in what is seen as one of the toughest challenges Ms Merkel has faced in her entire political career.  In Italy, the new populist government caused a fight with Malta and France over who should take responsibility for 630 people rescued from the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Libya, the main departure point for people trying to reach Europe.  Amid the mud-slinging, Spain\u0026rsquos new Socialist government agreed to take charge of the migrants last weekend.

Jim Monaghan, who was the spokesman for the Defend Tommy Sheridan Campaign, will be paid around \u0026pound30,000 a year to help build a \u0026ldquosustainable coalition for \u0026ldquosocial change.  However, a senior party source blasted the move, saying: \u0026ldquoThis is an absolutely staggering decision that has stunned the party. Jim Monaghan is a wild conspiracy theorist who has defended convicted perjurer Tommy Sheridan. Organisers are among the most vital party staff members, in charge of local campaigning operations and responsible for speaking directly to voters. This is like the SNP putting the cybernats in charge of door knocking. It\u0026rsquos utterly bewildering.  Labour advertised for seven organiser posts in February, three of which were to be based north of the border.  The job advert stated that successful applicants should have the ability to work with a \u0026ldquovariety of stakeholders and Monaghan landed one of the jobs. However, he has had strong ties to Sheridan, who is considered to be a toxic figure on the left.  The former Glasgow MSP, who used to lead the Scottish Socialist Party, won a \u0026pound200,000 defamation case against the now-defunct News of the World in 2006 amid claims he was an adulterer and swinger.  Conflicting evidence led to a police investigation and Sheridan was charged with perjury, after which a lengthy criminal trial took place in 2010. Monaghan was a defence witness in the trial.  A jury found Sheridan guilty of perjury, part of which explicitly related to a trip Sheridan and others made to a sex club in Manchester.  BBC footage on the day of Sheridan\u0026rsquos sentencing showed Monaghan clapping the former MSP as he walked to court. He had also previously carried out paid work for Sheridan\u0026rsquos then solicitor.  Monaghan was also a volunteer on the campaign to \u0026ldquodefend the politician and planned a book - A Parcel o\u0027 Rogues: The Tommy Sheridan Conspiracy - which he later abandoned.  He also acted as \u0026ldquonational press and media spokesperson for Solidarity - the party Sheridan helped form after quitting the SSP - before joining Labour in 2010.  Monaghan wrote at the time: \u0026ldquoObviously, there is a long and hard battle within Labour and it isn\u0026rsquot one that will even take place, never mind be decided, in the context of the current leadership election. I am confident that, for at least the next few years, it is best for me and for my community that I work within the Labour party.  In December, the Sunday Herald revealed that Monaghan was one of the warm up acts at a Labour event attended by UK and Scottish leaders Jeremy Corbyn and Richard Leonard. He read poetry on the night.  Asked last year if he still believed Sheridan was the victim of a conspiracy, Monaghan said: \u0026ldquoYes, absolutely.

Campaigners say the ban on MSPs visiting the holding centre in South Lanarkshire should be lifted, but the Home Office says that visits are generally only for MPs due to immigration being a policy area that is reserved to Westminster.  However, Glasgow MSP Pauline McNeill has said that the rule should be scrapped and MSPs should be allowed to check on the welfare of detainees.  She said that all MSPs should be able to make an annual visit in light of concerns that have been raised over the conditions and treatment of inmates.  \u0026ldquoMSP\u0026rsquos must be allowed access to witness the conditions in which people being detained in this country are being held,\" she said.  \"I\u0026rsquom calling for Members of the Scottish Parliament to be granted access to the site on an annual basis.  \"Members of the Scottish Parliament must be able to satisfy themselves that the welfare and health needs of the people being detained are being attended to.  \"By visiting the centre members would be fulfilling the normal duties and rights of elected members in any democracy.\"  Critics of UK immigration policy have expressed concerns about the length of time asylum seekers are held at Dungavel.  Reports on Dungavel have shown that dozens of detainees have been held at the facility for months at a time, and in some instances, for over a year.  The Sunday Herald previously spoke to former detainees, who claimed vulnerable people were held in prison like conditions at the site.  McNeill said Scottish Secretary David Mundell should use his influence to get the Home Office to lift the ban.  She added: \u0026ldquoI have serious concerns not only about the way the site is being run, but also by the attitude the UK Government is taking in regards to this issue.  \"I myself had to write to David Mundell on a number of occasions before receiving a response.  \"I am calling on David Mundell to support me in seeking annual visits for Members of the Scottish Parliament.  \"It is not acceptable that the concerns of Members of the Scottish Parliament about the treatment of people from the communities we represent are being ignored.  Meanwhile, SNP MPs Stuart McDonald and Joanna Cherry are to be allowed to visit Dungavel after demanding access.  McDonald, the SNP\u0026rsquos spokesman on immigration, asylum and border control, and Cherry, the party\u0027s justice and home affairs spokeswoman, wrote to the Home Office asking for permission.  McDonald said a date had yet to be set for a visit.  However, he said MSPs should also be allowed to check on the welfare of detainees, as he backed McNeill\u0027s call.  He said: \"The Home Office has a pretty bad record on this. It (Dungavel) should be open to all.\"  In response, a Home Office spokesman said: \"Individuals or organisations who do not have a statutory right of access and who wish to view an immigration removal centre are required under the provisions of the detention centre rules 2001 to obtain the permission of the Secretary of State.  \u0026ldquoRequests to visit are carefully considered to preserve the privacy and dignity of the individuals detained and to avoid a disproportionate number of visits."},{"url":null,"title":"Scotland well placed for PIP powers says minister","story":"              THIS week the MS Society launched their report \u0026lsquoPIP: A step too far\u0026rsquo which outlined the impact of the \u0026lsquo20 metre rule\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash the rule that bars anyone who can walk that distance unaided from receiving the enhanced rate of PIP \u0026ndash has had on those living with multiple sclerosis.  They found large numbers of those reassessed from DLA to PIP had lost that higher rate of support, with three quarters of those affected saying that the change had had a negative impact on their life.  This is the latest in a series of examples where people living with a debilitating health condition have been let down by the UK Government.  In February this year, the House of Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee published a damning report, along with a series of recommendations, about the assessment processes of the UK Government\u0026rsquos Personal Independent Payment (PIP) and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).  These are recommendations for the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) to respond to by halting the roll-out of PIP to allow them to make serious changes \u0026ndash something we have called for consistently.  And, whilst ESA remains a reserved benefit the Scottish Government cannot change, I have taken a particular interest in the Committee\u0026rsquos recommendations on PIP as, by the end of this Parliamentary term in 2021, we will have taken over responsibility from the DWP for 11 benefits, including PIP. I am reassured that so many of the recommendations reflect what we are already doing in Scotland.  This government is clear that social security is a human right and one that people should be able to access in a way that treats them with dignity and respect. This principle is so important it is enshrined on the very first page of our new Social Security (Scotland) Act.  There is a noticeable common thread that runs through the House of Commons Committee\u0026rsquos recommendations, which is that the current system places significant and undue stress on people, through unclear communications, appearing to require the repeated provision of evidence and \u0026lsquohealth\u0026rsquo assessments that seem ill suited to understanding fluctuating conditions amongst others.  This is exactly what we have heard through our own engagement with our Experience Panels - 2,400 people with personal and direct experience of the current system. Our new social security agency \u0026ndash Social Security Scotland \u0026ndash is being co-designed using that experience and knowledge, and that of our stakeholder reference groups and user research. We are determined to design and build systems and processes that work for people, not against them.  For example, we have held a forum with people to understand the issues with the current DWP application process and in particular the self-assessment form so that we can make the improvements people need.  We will ensure that all information is accessible and we are also developing an online route for applications, as well as Easy-Read and other accessible formats.  We are committed to ensuring that people are offered a choice of ways to apply for disability benefits, including in person, online, paper and telephone.  We are continuing to test these with people who receive benefits to explore what other communication channels we should provide.  I understand the stress and anxiety that can accompany current DWP face-to-face assessments. And an important commitment that I am making to people in Scotland is that we will reduce these as much as possible. Our Act specifically states that face to face assessments will only be held if necessary and crucially will never be with a private contractor.  Key to this is ensuring that we gather appropriate evidence at the initial stage.  The person applying clearly knows best what they need but we are also exploring the range of health, social care and other evidence that could be used to support quality decision making, significantly reduce the need for face-to-face assessments and increase the number of lifetime and genuinely long-term awards.  We will take into account the needs of the individual to determine whether a home visit is needed, and people will be entitled to have someone with them to give support every step of the way.  And anyone who, because of a disability, finds it difficult to engage fully with us, will have the right to independent advocacy support.  Through our work we will meet all of the Work and Pension Select Committee\u0026rsquos recommendations on what should be done, where we have the powers to do so.  The chance to create something different in Scotland is there. The chance to introduce a greater level of compassion and respect into our country\u0026rsquos social security service is one we fully intend to take."},{"url":null,"title":"Marchers demand vote on final Brexit deal","story":"              TENS of thousands of people marched through central London to demand a final vote on any UK exit deal, on the second anniversary of the Brexit vote.  Organisers of the People\u0027s Vote march say Brexit is \"not a done deal\" and people must \"make their voices heard\".  The protests were held as senior Cabinet ministers, including Liam Fox and David Davis, insist the UK is prepared to walk away from talks without an agreement.  World War Two veteran Stephen Goodall, 96, led the pro-EU protesters as they headed from Pall Mall to Parliament Square.  Among those addressing the demonstrators was Gina Miller, who successfully campaigned to ensure the UK could not trigger talks on leaving without the approval of Parliament.  She said: \"Together we must stand up, demand our voices are heard, demand a people\u0027s vote so that future generations can hear us say we did our bit we stood up and shouted for a country that\u0027s together, kinder, tolerant.  \"This is not a time to be silent.\"  Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said Brexit was \"not a done deal\" and could be reversed, while Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas told the crowd that Brexit \"will be a disaster for this country\".  Meanwhile, thousands of Scottish independence supporters staged a march to Bannockburn.  The latest All Under One Banner event near Stirling follows large marches in Glasgow and Dumfries earlier this year.  An estimated 8,000 people took part in Saturday\u0027s march which centred on Bannockburn, where Robert the Bruce claimed victory over Edward II\u0027s English army in 1314.  The march started at Kings Park in Stirling and continued for around two miles to Bannockburn.  Further marches are planned for Dundee and Edinburgh later in 2018."},{"url":null,"title":"Future shock    39 Incorruptible  39  corpses of saints are the McDonald  39 s hamburgers of religious delusion","story":"              A FRIEND recently confided that he\u0026rsquod discovered an uneaten McDonald\u0026rsquos meal of indeterminate age under the bed while decontaminating his disgusting hovel. This particular room had been subject to historic disregard \u0026ndash and perhaps somewhere deep within that dusty pit also lie the bones of Shergar and Lord Lucan. Pecked dry by the last surviving dodo.  Apparently this \u0026ldquohappy meal had festered under my pal\u0026rsquos stinking crypt for at least a year. It\u0026rsquos likely the clatty b***er even braved a bite \u0026ndash because, remarkably, this burger still looked exactly the same as it did on the day of purchase. If he had been inclined towards religious fervour, my friend may have chosen to place this \u0026ldquoincorruptible meat in a glass display case and pronounce it a miracle.  Although it is indeed miraculous that a happy meal\u0026rsquos free plastic toy may rot away before anything else in the box, there is little likelihood of any supernatural deity\u0026rsquos involvement. Neither was this burger made from some sort of magical \u0026ldquoholy cow \u0026ndash McDonald\u0026rsquos has admitted that each single pate is formed from the remains of around 100 doe-eyed bovine. That\u0026rsquos nearly a whole field \u0026ndash a super-value meal indeed if you get a thrill from counting how much death it\u0026rsquos taken to keep your belly full over the years.  So, if God wasn\u0026rsquot involved in this burger\u0026rsquos immortality, then what caused it? A recent US scientific study into fast food\u0026rsquos mysterious ambivalence to nature concluded that the key to its durable physicality wasn\u0026rsquot any Judeo-Christian sky spy, creepy chemical or powdered preservative \u0026ndash but simply a lack of moisture and specific atmospheric conditions.  This brings us smoothly segueing into religious perceptions of such \u0026ldquoincorruptibility \u0026ndash once a prominent, earnest and profitable subdivision of Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox lore. This phenomenon was fuelled by the once popular practice of exhuming bodies to check if they had decayed in a \u0026ldquonormal manner. Signs of unnatural preservation were often believed to be the work of an interventionist God, justifying the macabre yet still popular practice of putting beef jerky on display in glass tombs. These exploited corpses are no sleeping beauties waiting on a kiss, however.  WOULD THEY LIE TO YOU?  THE Roman Catholic Church has put hundreds of \u0026ldquoincorruptible corpses on public display, making up for this indignity by promoting these bodies\u0026rsquo previous owners to sainthood. Discovering these demigods often meant macabre Burke and Hare-style exhumations of individuals rumoured to have committed acts of miraculous endeavour. One day, Charles and Eddie of \u0026ldquoWould I Lie To You? fame may be dug up to check if Eddie\u0026rsquos glossy mane is still intact. Perhaps Charles will have retained the twinkle in his eye.  Yet, even if the soul-pop duo are found in good enough nick to perform their hit again, the Catholic Church of 2018 might not be interested \u0026ndash as incorruptibility is no longer a miracle. Even the Vatican authorities now admit that pious folk of past eras had clearly tried to help God along with the whole process. It seems many former Popes and saints currently rotting under the Vatican were subjected to the indignity of having oil and herbs inserted into their muscle cavities to aid preservation. Some were even dead at the time. Such saintly \u0026ldquoincorruptibles have even been reported to exude a sweet odour upon exhumation \u0026ndash yes, embalming fluids and exotic ointments can be particularly potent.  Historically, those thought to have performed miraculous deeds in life were quickly buried in multiple airtight caskets after death, such was the fervour for their inevitable sainthood. These were built of zinc and lead and kept above ground in crypts \u0026ndash environmental circumstances suspiciously favourable to preservation. They were later exhumed to much fanfare and fired into garish glass displays for the faithful to gawp at in holy reverence.  These bodies remained attached to their blackened skin and calcified muscle structure, but not their dignity. Now that the Vatican itself has denounced \u0026ldquoincorruptibility as evidence for sainthood, perhaps it\u0026rsquos time to end these voyeuristic horror shows once and for all. Such abused corpses have surely now earned the right to a dignified burial rather than simply serving as a grim public testament to less enlightened times.  WHEN THE ROT SETS IN  THERE are countless natural processes which aid \u0026ldquoincorruptibility in those who did not benefit of from casual DIY mummification by the early Catholic Church. For instance, long before the 20th century\u0026rsquos cretinous, ruinous adherence to gluttony, most Europeans either died from starvation or disease. Wasting was also accelerated by religious penance. Such a grim death relieved bodies of the moist fat reserves that will accelerate the current generation\u0026rsquos decomposition, but more importantly, it also wipes out colonies of gut bacteria which largely propel putrefaction.  Truth, as always, is more interesting than the myth. The cyclical reality of death is so simple and beautiful that Elton John even sang a song about it, Circle of Life. Of course, the lyric about humans being so wonderfully recyclable didn\u0026rsquot make the final cut as nothing rhymed with biodisposable. The verse about how we disintegrate in a manner that saturates the soil with a wealth of life juices and minerals to seed new life in joyous abundance made the 12 remix though. Limited edition release in Slovakia.  With such wonder evident, corpse deification seems an insult to mother nature, denying her built-in reincarnation process simply to prolong the vampiric myth-making of monotheism. The humiliating afterlife of bodily preservation is surely only ever acceptable when natural conditions such as alkaline soil or ice have played their part.  Somewhat exotically, some human corpses have even been found \u0026ldquosaponified \u0026ndash buried in lime-enriched soil that converts body fat into hard soap. A clean death indeed. Others are preserved forever, ironically it may turn out, thanks to past eras of seismic climate change \u0026ndash such as the famous iceman Otzi of Bolzano. Otzi is the only guy on Earth cooler then the Fonz. And, remarkably, even older than Henry Winkler was when playing the alleged teenager.  NO HURRY TO DISPEL THE ILLUSION  FEW would deny there is clear historical \u0026ndash and present \u0026ndash precedent of society\u0026rsquos most powerful, privileged and influential echelons bending the mindsets of the masses to keep their illusion of hierarchic superiority flickering.  However, when it comes to the generations of the past passing off \u0026ldquoincorruptible corpses as the work of God, the benefit of the doubt might be warranted. Bodily decay is a complex and unpredictable process and was likely often misunderstood.  Still, folk then could surely have asked themselves a logical question as relevant then as it is now: if God is behind such preservation \u0026ndash and is, assumedly, all-powerful \u0026ndash then why do \u0026ldquoincorruptibles cover such a wide spectrum of decay? Why don\u0026rsquot they all stay as fresh as Ant McPartlin after a shave?  It\u0026rsquos likely folk always wondered the same thing. Using the Ant of their time as the analogy. Or perhaps their tongues were tied by the knowledge of what happened to Galileo and others for questioning God\u0026rsquos mysterious ways in public.  As science now understands, bodies don\u0026rsquot all decompose at the same rate. This fact has clearly led to seismic misunderstandings throughout history \u0026ndash and is the likely origin of all European vampire myths and Haitian zombie culture. We didn\u0026rsquot always fire folk underground then forget about them. Sometimes, we\u0026rsquod check to make sure they were still dead.  The fact that \u0026ldquoincorruptible corpses can now be rather easily explained leaves a greater mystery, however \u0026ndash the endurance of belief in the phenomenon. Perhaps the answer lies in how the Catholic Church continues to propagate the myth. In 1975, Monsignor Gianfranco Nolli, director of the Vatican\u0026rsquos Egyptian Museum, put together a team of mummification researchers to preserve all their popes, saints and \u0026ldquorelics \u0026ndash sacred body parts dating way back as far as the third century.  This team was also responsible for one of the Vatican\u0026rsquos top tourist attractions under the city: the body of John XXIII, who looks in fine nick despite dying in 1963. The airless glass coffin helps, but so do the realistic wax hands and death mask. More than 25,000 people visit St Peter\u0026rsquos Basilica to see him every day, and many of these faithful servants truly believe the beautific state of his body is a miracle. Understandably, the church is hesitant to clarify the truth that he\u0026rsquod be better suited to Madame Tussauds.  Ironically, only one of the specialist embalming team which treated Pope John and countless other \u0026ldquoholy corpses is still alive. The others tragically succumbed to various cancers, with side-effects of toxic chemicals they worked with during their macabre efforts immortalising the dead speculated to be responsible.  The most famous instance of incorruptibility, which many believe to be the real McCoy, is that of Bernadette Soubirous who died in 1879. She\u0026rsquos the one responsible for a booming tourist economy in Lourdes \u0026ndash five million people a year \u0026ndash after claiming she was visited by the Virgin Mary. In death, Bernadette\u0026rsquos body was exhumed three times \u0026ndash but kept above ground after the third and final indignity before being \u0026ldquotreated and placed inside, yes, an airtight glass tomb. It couldn\u0026rsquot have worked very well as what most people think of as the word\u0026rsquos more remarkably life-like corpse is actually, like John XXIII, a wax cocoon \u0026ndash the real Bernadette lies festering somewhere inside. Perhaps she should join John in Madame Tussauds. It certainly couldn\u0026rsquot be any less garish a display than the gold and crystal reliquary in the Chapel of Saint Bernadette where she currently resides, her vulgar afterlife helping maintain the hypnotic spell enslaving the faithful. And, of course, keeping the coffers full."},{"url":null,"title":"Jogger detained for two weeks after accidental US border crossing","story":"              A 19-year-old woman who travelled from France to Canada to visit her mother in British Columbia says US officials detained her for two weeks after she accidentally crossed the border while jogging.

Mr Cruddas \u0026ndash a self-proclaimed major Brexiteer \u0026ndash accused peers of seeking to block Brexit by backing amendments to give Parliament a \u0026ldquomeaningful vote on the final deal and how to proceed in the absence of a withdrawal agreement.  The spread betting tycoon, 64, told the Press Association no deal was better than a bad deal for the UK and claimed peers had overstepped the mark after seeking to push through 15 amendments to the Brexit Bill.

It is a historic moment for women who have had to rely on their husbands, fathers, brothers and drivers to run basic errands, get to work, visit friends or even drop children off at school.  The ban had relegated women to the backseat, restricting when and how they move around.  But after midnight on Sunday, Saudi women finally joined women around the world in being able to get behind the wheel of a car and simply drive.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom speechless.

For nearly three decades, outspoken Saudi women and the men who supported them had called for women to have the right to drive.  They faced arrest for defying the ban as women in other Muslim countries drove freely.  In 1990, during the first driving campaign by activists, women who got behind the wheels of their cars in the capital, Riyadh, lost their jobs, faced severe stigmatisation and were barred from travel abroad for a year.

Ahead of allowing women to drive, the kingdom passed a law against sexual harassment with up to five years in prison for the most severe cases.  Criticism against women driving has largely been muted since since King Salman announced last year that they would be allowed to drive.  With state-backed support for the move, many Saudis now say they support the decision allowing women to drive and see it as long overdue.  Not all women are driving at once, though. The overwhelming majority of women in Saudi Arabia still do not have licences.  Many have not had a chance to take the gender-segregated driving courses that were first offered to women only three months ago.

Nia Griffith stressed it was party policy to support the nuclear deterrent, adding uncertainty in the world meant this is not the time to be \"descaling\" it.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn voted against Trident renewal in July 2016.  The Commons vote saw MPs back the replacement of the existing submarine fleet carrying the missiles with four new Successor submarines.  Renewal of the submarines for the continuous-at-sea deterrent has been predicted to cost \u0026pound31 billion, with a \u0026pound10 billion contingency fund also set aside.  Ms Griffith told BBC One\u0027s The Andrew Marr Show: \"It\u0027s Labour Party policy that we keep Trident.  \"The decisions have been taken, the work is being undertaken and that is not a decision we\u0027re going back on.  \"So we\u0027re very, very clear - having a nuclear deterrent is a very important part of our defence policy. It\u0027s also an important part of being a tier-one nation and being in the UN Security Council.\"  Asked about her previous remarks in which she questioned the need for Trident, Ms Griffith said: \"I think if you look at the world today it\u0027s a more uncertain place than it\u0027s ever been.  \"I think if you look at the way the United States is not stepping up to the mark, I don\u0027t think this is the right time to be getting rid of our nuclear deterrent.  \"Of course we need to keep an eye on costs, of course we need to make sure we get value for money, and it is a challenging situation when it\u0027s a single-source purchase - much more difficult than when you have competition.  \"But at the end of the day, this is not the time to be descaling our nuclear deterrent.\"  Ms Griffith later said she would \"absolutely\" support sending more British troops to Afghanistan.  Last month, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was understood to have written to Prime Minister Theresa May recommending that the UK increased its numbers to bolster efforts to counter the Taliban.  It was said between 400 to 450 soldiers could be sent to join the roughly 600 already deployed in non-combat roles following pressure from US President Donald Trump for international allies to do more.  Ms Griffith, asked if Labour would support sending more troops to Afghanistan, said: \"We certainly support the idea that you cannot abandon a process halfway through.  \"We know it\u0027s not going to take one year or two years, it\u0027s going to be 20, 30 years for the government of Afghanistan to become stable and as stable as we would like - so it will take longer.  \"And if we have the expertise that we can offer, then certainly we\u0027re willing to put that in.\"  Pressed again if she would support putting more British troops into Afghanistan, Ms Griffith replied: \"Absolutely.\""},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie menswear firm toasts 100k whisky contract","story":"\t\tPernod Ricard, owners of several prestigious spirit brands, has awarded a \u0026#163100k retail contract to menswear outfitters Gibbs Inverurie.\t\t\t\tA contingent of 875 Chinese are heading across the globe for a 4-day whisky extravaganza in July.

Now, however, the cost of electricity to power festive lighting will continue to be covered by the local authority after a new approach was agreed by councillors.                                                    Members of the Infrastructure Services Committee (ISC) gave the go ahead to a new policy aimed at ensuring a reasonable, consistent and safe approach to requests from community groups.        Hanging baskets, banners and bunting are also covered by the new rules, as well as attachments to street lighting columns, such as signs.Councillors heard the use of festive lighting, bunting, banners and hanging baskets can help encourage commercial activity in towns, add seasonal colour and help promote community events.ISC previously considered proposals which would have seen community groups covering electricity costs for festive lights, hearing there was strong opposition to this from local councillors and groups.Members asked officers to revisit the plans, setting up a working group to further investigate the potential impacts of the proposals.                                                                                                        An engagement meeting was held with groups in April where a number of concerns were raised and consideration of these led to changes to the proposed policy. Electricity supplied through the public street lighting network will not be charged for and the council will now perform technical assessments on the suitability of lighting columns and advise community groups after it had been initially proposed that applicants would have to perform these safety tests themselves.Applications for festive lighting installations can now be submitted by October 1.There will be restrictions on installations outwith main footfall areas, but an arrangement to allow the use of festive lights featuring the branding of commercial organisations will be extended by a year.ISC chair, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: “The cost of electricity for festive lighting in Aberdeenshire is around £11,000 and that seems a small price to pay for the goodwill of communities making the effort to brighten themselves up and appear welcoming at Christmas – we recognise a lot of organisation and effort goes into this already. The excellent work communities do is clearly of benefit to the whole of Aberdeenshire and the cost is one we can bear.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"pupils enjoy kidsout event","story":"\t\tLocal youngsters enjoyed a fun day participating in a wide range of activities when they attended a Rotary KidsOut Aberdeen event held a SRUC Craibstone Campus recently.\t\t\t\tTwelve pupils and eight teachers from Ellon Primary School, along with two Ellon Rotarian helpers attended.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

Orkney topped the table in Scotland and was placed tenth in the UK as a whole.While is the responsibility of businesses to make sure they are meeting hygiene standards, local authorities play an important role in ensuring food safety compliance, with enforcement overseen by the Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland.Chairman of Orkney Islands Council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, Councillor Graham Sinclair, said the results demonstrate constructive working between the Council’s Environmental Health team and the local business community:“We’re delighted yet again to see Orkney feature at the top of this survey.“This consistency speak volumes not only about the quality of the advice and guidance the council team provides, but also the commitment of local businesses to their food safety responsibilities and on providing safe premises and products for their customers.“It reflects very well on Orkney and on the quality eating and dining out experience for locals and visitors alike.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.
