Mr Hinds will say: \u0027As a nation I\u0027m afraid we\u0027ve been technical education snobs. Chris Dawson\u0027s teen lover and babysitter will take centre...Qantas passenger, 48, is found guilty of ‘body slamming’ a...Share this article\u0027We\u0027ve revered the academic but treated vocational as second class. Why has this been tolerated for so long? I think the reason is the \u0027OPC\u0027 problem. For so many opinion formers, commentators and politicians: vocational courses are for \u0027other people\u0027s children\u0027.\u0027 During his speech, Mr Hinds will argue that the default route and measure of success for young people should no longer just be an academic one. Unless Britain drops that mindset it will never close the productivity gap with its European neighbours, an ambition that is more crucial as we leave the EU, he will say.          Prime Minister Theresa May and Chancellor Philip Hammond at Leeds College of Building in 2017 and seeing some of the work young people are undertakingGermany, France and the US all produce over 25 per cent more per hour than the UK. If Britain matched Germany on productivity it could boost taxes available for public services by tens of billions more a year.Mr Hinds will add: \u0027We need to make clear to young people, and their parents – that a degree is not the only path to a great job.\u0027I\u0027m clear that the school that gets a young person on to a higher apprenticeship deserves as much praise as when it gets someone to university.\u0027To be clear, the message here is not don\u0027t do a degree. The message is you don\u0027t have to do a degree. \u0027We want young people to acquire the higher qualifications that lead to high-skilled, more rewarding jobs – whether through a degree, a higher apprenticeship or higher technical qualifications.\u0027The Government has already created \u0027T-levels\u0027, technical alternatives to A-levels, which will be launched in 2020."},{"url":null,"title":"Kanye Wests stepfather reveals rapper confident prodigy genius child","story":"    Kanye West\u0027s \u0027stepfather\u0027 has told DailyMailTV that the outspoken rapper has always had an ego as he reveals that the \u0027prodigy genius child\u0027 had a slight speech impediment and had dreams of becoming a baseball player          Speaking to DailyMailTV, Blakeley says that from a young age Kanye\u0027s talent was \u0027off the scale\u0027, saying he was \u0027a prodigy genius child from when I first set eyes on him\u0027          Ulysses Blakeley lived with West and his mother Donda throughout the musician\u0027s childhood.   The 67-year-old watched Kanye grow up from the age of three to 11 and even bought Donda and Kanye their first home on South Shore Drive in Chicago    Ulysses Blakeley  was one of Donda\u0027s last true loves before she died after a botched cosmetic surgery operation in November 2007Blakeley said Kanye would rap in poems all the time instead of speaking normally, even for the most mundane things, like passing the salt at the dinner table. \u0027We installed into him an unshakable belief in his own talents, we encouraged him, and when he does things different, you don\u0027t judge anything he does artistically or poetically. So he would speak to you in poems, and sometimes, he\u0027d talk in riddles, and it would be like: \u0027\u0027Stop that now\u0027\u0027. But we tried not to be like that,\u0027 he adds.Although Blakeley says that he doesn\u0027t know how much influence he had on West\u0027s music and art, he does admit: \u0027How much of Kanye was innate and nothing to do with us? It might have been us or might have been the environment we created. We were both musical, writers, and cultural. Did that provide the path to wherever he is?\u0027 Although West was different, he didn\u0027t get bullied and would stand up for himself, a trait he shared with everyone in his family.\u0027He was a tough little kid, not bully-able in any way, shape or form. I remember one time he was out in the park, a boy who was ten or eleven, and Kanye was only five, took his Frisbee and threw it in the tree,\u0027 says Blakeley.\u0027Kanye told him to get it down, but this boy just played around with him, so Kanye socked him, pow, he kicked his a**, regardless of his size. There\u0027s not this intellectual, nerdy reticence in him. There\u0027s nobody in his family like that, they\u0027re forthright and aggressive.\u0027But the family did go to church and Sunday School every week. Donda says in her book that they\u0027d attend Christ Universal Temple in Chicago, a black megachurch on the South Side: \u0027I wanted Kanye to be steeped in that kind of exposure to God.\u0027It\u0027s a little known fact that West also went to a \u0027positive thinking\u0027 kindergarten for black children called the New Concept Development Center, where he was taught Swahili by Donda\u0027s trusted friend and fellow professor, Haki Madhubuti.          The star\u0027s very first music studio was his bedroom on Longwood Drive, Blue Island (pictured) - which is now an abandoned, ramshackle home, until his mother booted him out for playing his music 247          Blakeley said him and Donda \u0027installed into him an unshakable belief in his own talents, we encouraged him, and when he does things different, you don\u0027t judge anything he does\u0027When Donda and West went to China, they traveled to Thailand, frequenting the red light district of Bangkok and visiting nude beaches on Koh Samui. They also slummed it in the infamous Chungking Mansions, in Hong Kong, a ghetto block, notorious for its sex workers and drug peddlers.According to her book, Donda reveals: \u0027Once, Kanye and I literally took the slow boat from Canton to Hong Kong, where we\u0027d spend two weeks before going on to visit Thailand. \u0027In Hong Kong, we stayed in what became known as Slum King Mansion. The bath was down the hall and the room was definitely no-frills. The cost was eleven US dollars a night, if that tells you anything.EXCLUSIVE: \u0027If Donda was alive he wouldn\u0027t be married to...Jay-Z insists he WASN\u0027T dissing Kanye West over his Trump...\u0027Congrats on influencing all your fans\u0027: Shock as teetotal...Share this article\u0027When we got to Thailand we visited Bangkok first. Kanye went right along to the red-light district with me. From there it was on to Koh Samui. The beaches there are some of the most beautiful in the world. \u0027I was totally embarrassed, though, when one of the professors (also a Catholic priest) asked Kanye what was the favorite part of his holiday. Kanye answered: \u0027\u0027The nude beaches in Thailand\u0027\u0027.\u0027But this is nothing compared to the revelations that Donda reveals about West\u0027s sexual habits when he was approaching his teenage years.She wrote: \u0027I talked with him about it, like I talked with him about everything. There was no topic that was off limits, not even sex. When he was twelve, that conversation came up.\u0027It was my time to car pool and Kanye was in the car along with two of his friends. Jocelyn Elders came on the radio and, as I remember it, she was talking about the rise of teenage pregnancy.\u0027  Blakeley said: \u0027He was a little boy, preschool. He was off the scale. One time, someone asked him when they were looking at his drawings: \u0027Do you want to be an artist when you grow up?\u0027 He said: \u0027I am an artist\u0027. The ego\u0027s always been there!\u0027          Donda revealed in her book that she encouraged Kanye to masturbate rather than having sex with girlfriends at a young age. She added: \u0027I found out later my words had sunk in because Kanye told me so\u0027Donda continues in the book: \u0027That\u0027s when I told Kanye and his friends that masturbation was a far better alternative to having sex at such a young age.  \u0027I told them it was perfectly healthy, normal, and gratifying and that they did not have to participate in sex with another partner and risk some young lady getting pregnant or contracting a venereal disease, not the least of which was AIDS. They said nothing.\u0027They just sat there anxious for us to get to school I\u0027m sure, so they could get out of that car. I found out later my words had sunk in because Kanye told me so.\u0027After coming back from China, the pair moved home several times.          Blakeley had a special relationship with West, Donda revealed in her 2007 biography, Raising Kanye, which was published just before she diedThe star\u0027s very first music studio was his bedroom on Longwood Drive, Blue Island - which is now an abandoned, ramshackle home, until his mother booted him out for playing his music 247.Donda reveals: \u0027Kanye spent hours and hours mixing, rapping, and writing. It was nonstop. He became so involved that his socializing revolved around that studio in his room.\u0027That thumping bass line seemed to shake the very foundation of our house. Boom-boom-boom day and night. There were all sorts of people coming in and out of the house. \u0027Mainly it was the thundering bass that was no longer welcome—not all day and all night, anyway. I finally had to say to Kanye: \u0027You\u0027re moving\u0027.\u0027Another of his former homes, a tiny, rundown apartment on Lake Bluff Drive, Tinley Park, is where West saw the apparition of Christ - Yeezus meets Jesus!Donda reveals: \u0027One day Kanye was playing in the dining room of our first home in Chicago, a third-floor apartment on the South Side. \u0027All of a sudden, he looked toward the door and the staircase leading down. He pointed and said, \u0027Look, there goes Jesus!\u0027 My heart raced. I saw energy.           Blakeley watched Kanye grow up from the age of three to 11 and even bought Donda and Kanye their first home on South Shore Drive in Chicago (pictured)  The house was meant to be turned into a community center for the youth, but arguments between a charity named after Donda and Kanye means it hasn\u0027t happened yet\u0027To this day, I believe it was Christ giving us just a little extra protection that day. Neither Kanye nor I have spoken of it since.\u0027But it was very real to me and just one of the reasons I think Kanye is connected in a special way or for a special purpose. God has chosen him to not only reach but also touch millions.\u0027 Kanye\u0027s first job was as a busboy collecting plates at the American diner chain Bob Evans.Although, according to Donda, \u0027he decided immediately that bussing tables was not something that would work for him. He quit on his first day before he even started.\u0027When West finally broke onto the music scene, he moved to New York, where he found an apartment at the Hudson Tea Building, in New Jersey, directly across the river from Manhattan, as can be seen in our images.\u0027We rented it, sight unseen. It was $850 a month, with a living room and a step-up great room with a glass ceiling. You could actually look up and see the sky. It was wonderful. And Kanye was inspired...\u0027Kanye loved that place. He called up his friends and said, \u0027Man, you should see this place. It\u0027s like something off of TV.\u0027 Kanye was exactly where he wanted to be. He was on his way to fulfilling his dream,\u0027 says Donda in her book.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Kendall Jenner Ben Simmons slip college basketball game canoodle","story":"    Kendall Jenner and her rumored boyfriend Ben Simmons stunned students when they turned up at a college basketball game in Philadelphia          The Keeping Up With The Kardashians superstar and the 76ers athlete slipped into a game at Drexel University on Saturday afternoon to watch as the Drexel Dragons took on the Robert Morris Colonials      Go hell for leather like Kendall wearing a coat by FrameAvailable at FWRDIf there is one coat doing the rounds amongst the A-list it’s got to be this one by Frame, which has already been seen on Kaia Gerber, Kylie Jenner and now it was Kendall Jenner’s turn.The model made quite the statement when attending a basketball game this week as she opted to wear the leather trench coat with straight-leg trousers and trainers, which resulted in a casual look.

It has already affected the lives of nearly three million girls and young women across sub-Saharan Africa.Its CEO, Lucy Lake, who was with the sixth in line to the throne in Zambia, revealed to the Mail that she had briefed his wife privately at Kensington Palace earlier this year about their work in the country, as well as Zimbabwe, Ghana, Tanzania and Malawi.The Duchess was also met with Zimbabwean-born Angeline Murimirwa, one of the first girls to go to secondary school with the organisation\u0027s support and is now its African executive director. She was named last year as one of the BBC\u0027s 100 most inspirational women.Lucy said: \u0027We had the opportunity to meet with the Duchess in the spring.

Big fan of yours!’I replied, and for the next few months, we corresponded on a regular basis.We’d chat about everything from US gun violence (she shares my horror of it) to a charity trip she made for the United Nations to Rwanda, spinning classes, calligraphy, and our joint hatred of 4am filming call-times - hers for Suits and mine for Good Morning Britain in the UK.She even started sending me early preview episodes of her show so we could debate juicy storylines yet to air – which we did, at length.Meghan introduced me via cyberspace to another Suits cast member, Rick Hoffman - who played Louis Litt – and he and I also began to regularly correspond. He described their relationship to me as so close it felt like ‘brother and sister’.In February 2016, Rick came to London and at my invitation, he appeared on Good Morning Britain.Nobody really knew who he was here, nor Meghan for that matter, but we had a fun interview and I sent the photos to Meghan afterwards - who was thrilled by them.          When her co-star Hoffman was in London in early 2016, I had him on my show - even though no one knew who he was in the UK. They didn\u0027t know who Meghan was either thenMeghan and Harry set to stay with Kate and William at Anmer...\u0027She social climbed her way out of my orbit\u0027: Piers Morgan...Samantha Markle mocks sister Meghan over claims she wanted...Share this articleIn early June, 2016, she messaged me to say: ‘I’m in London for a week of meetings and Wimbledon. Would love to say hi!’I suggested my local pub, the Scarsdale Tavern in Kensington – ironically just a few hundred yards from where she now lives at Kensington Palace.‘Serena Williams sends her love,’ she texted on the day from Wimbledon, where she was watching her friend play in the annual tennis tournament. ‘You’re very popular as it turns out. Get you!’I don’t hear those words very often, so they made an impression…Then she turned up at the pub and we had a very enjoyable time for 90 minutes or so before I put her in a taxi to a dinner she was having with friends at 5 Hertford Street, a fashionable club in London’s Mayfair.She spoke very candidly about her family - there were some private, sensitive things she told me I would never repeat because they were said in confidence - Donald Trump (she’s not a fan), and of course, Suits.She asked me for advice on her career and the media, and if she could come on Good Morning Britain next time she was over, which I said I would arrange.From the cab, Meghan sent me a series of texts thanking me and saying she was looking forward to meeting up again next time we were in the same city.She even publicly tweeted about how nice it was to see her ‘friend’ – me – in London.So at this point, I was indeed labouring under the massive misapprehension that we were friends.I was wrong.She met Prince Harry at the dinner that night, went on a solo date with him the next night, and I never heard from her again.Not a word.I’d been ghosted.          She met Prince Harry at a dinner the night we met in person, went on a solo date with him the next night, and I never heard from her again. Or her costar. I\u0027d been used. They were just rudeAnd not just by her.At Meghan’s behest, Rick Hoffman ghosted me too.I didn’t hear from him again for 18 months, then he eventually crawled out of the woodwork after attending the big royal wedding last May.‘Piers! I am very sorry for not responding,’ he wrote in a lengthy message. ‘You must understand, once I heard the news, out of respect for Meghan, I couldn’t share a thing. Now I can share fun stuff! I would love to catch up at that favorite pub of yours. Hope to hear from you pal. Love you pal. Rick.’I didn’t reply, because no, I didn’t ‘understand’.A real ‘pal’ doesn’t ghost a friend for 18 months, right?That’s just rude.In fact, I found the behaviour of the pair of them damn rude.I’d been ‘played’ by a couple of B-list actors, who were clearly just using me to advance their careers.           From the moment I read that Harry barked ‘What Meghan wants, Meghan gets! at staff in the run-up to the wedding, my heart sankBut when someone more important and influential came along, in the shape of Prince Harry, I was instantly dumped like a sack of spuds (that’s what we call potatoes in the UK).Now, on a certain level, I grudgingly admire the work.And frankly, who am I, a former tabloid newspaper editor, to take a dim view of such ruthless antics?But on another level, the whole experience left me feeling suspicious and cynical about Ms Markle.And nothing in her behaviour since marrying Prince Harry has alleviated those concerns.From the moment I read that he barked ‘What Meghan wants, Meghan gets! at palace courtiers in the run-up to the wedding, my heart sank.Because I fear that’s exactly what she’s used to getting.And anyone or anything that may not give her what she wants or gets in the way of her social climbing self-advancement gets discarded.Her first husband? Ditched as her Suits career took off.Her dysfunctional family? Banned from the wedding – all of them.Her poor old ailing Dad? Cut off and disowned for struggling to cope with media attention about his daughter.Meghan’s swapped her dreary, problematic old real world for a thrilling new fantasy world of the Queen, Michelle Obama and the Clooneys.Only her mother Doria made the cut to Princess Meghan’s AAA-list new life.          Her first husband Trevor was ditched as her Suits career took off          She ditched her family, cut off her ailing father and and only mom Doria made the list to Princess Meghan’s AAA-list new lifeBut pieces of work never change their spots.Now, there is a steady flow of negative stories streaming from Palace ‘insiders’ about Meghan’s alleged a antics.She was said to have ‘displeased’ the Queen by demanding an emerald tiara for the wedding.There are rumours of a growing rift with the Duchess of Cambridge, who was reported to have burst into tears over Meghan’s hostile behaviour during a bridesmaid dress fitting for her daughter Princess Charlotte.Kate was also reported to have complained about Meghan being needlessly unpleasant to a royal member of staff.

Jordan\u0027s performanceMuch is still in flux in the Oscar race ahead of Thursday morning\u0027s Golden Globes nominations. But unless something drastic happens, \u0027Black Panther\u0027 will next month become the first comic book film to be nominated for best picture and easily Marvel Studios\u0027 most significant Oscar contender ever.That\u0027s very good news for ABC\u0027s Feb. 24 telecast which is coming off an all-time low of 26.5 million viewers. Some 55.2 million watched \u0027Titanic\u0027 sweep the 1997 Oscars, and producers have long harbored dreams of another big-tent blockbuster pulling viewers to a broadcast increasingly dominated by independent films like \u0027The Shape of Water,\u0027 \u0027\u0027Moonlight\u0027 and \u0027Spotlight.\u0027 Usually, bigger movies mean bigger ratings.For the makers of \u0027Black Panther,\u0027 it\u0027s a new chapter for a film - with more than $1.3 billion in ticket sales, the third-highest all-time domestic gross and the biggest box-office hit ever directed by a black man - that has already filled record books. What does Coogler think of \u0027Black Panther\u0027 as an Oscar movie?\u0027Fortunately, I don\u0027t have to think about it that much,\u0027 the 32-year-old filmmaker of \u0027Fruitvale Station\u0027 and \u0027Creed\u0027 said in an interview. \u0027I\u0027ve grown to have close relationships with my collaborators, so I care about the crafts people who work on the film and the actors who work on the film. Because of those relationships, I\u0027m happy when they\u0027re happy. It\u0027s always nice when people are recognized for their work. But beyond that, I really don\u0027t worry about it.\u0027 The film is also in the running for Ruth Carter\u0027s costume design, the cinematography of Rachel Morrison and Hannah Beachler\u0027s production designYet few films will be watched more closely through awards season than \u0027Black Panther,\u0027 which is also in the running for Ruth Carter\u0027s costume design, the cinematography of Rachel Morrison (who last year became the first woman ever nominated in the category), Hannah Beachler\u0027s production design, Coogler\u0027s direction, the script by Joe Robert Cole and Coogler, Kendrick Lamar\u0027s song \u0027All the Stars\u0027 and Michael B. Jordan\u0027s supporting performance.\u0027Black Panther\u0027 has already been at the center of the uproar over the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\u0027 short-lived plans to institute a \u0027best popular film\u0027 category. The academy\u0027s move was intended to rope in more box-office hits to the broadcast, but critics said such a category would potentially ghettoize films like \u0027Black Panther\u0027 from the prestigious honor of best picture. (Coogler declined to address the category\u0027s scuttling.)While superhero films have dominated multiplexes for the last decade, the Oscars have been famously resistant to them. Ten years ago, \u0027The Dark Knight\u0027 earned eight nominations but missed out on best picture, prompting the film academy to expand the category the following year.   Coogler had a sense he wasn\u0027t alone in wanting a connection to the film, that others felt a need for it, too. \u0027But,\u0027 he says, \u0027I could never imagine to the extent that it did\u0027          With more than $1.3 billion in ticket sales, the film has the third-highest all-time domestic grossMany of the academy\u0027s members resent how superheroes have come to dominate the industry, but there have been some signs lately that anti-Marvel sentiment is ebbing. Last year, while \u0027Wonder Woman\u0027 failed to earn a nod, the Wolverine sequel \u0027Logan\u0027 became the first superhero film nominated for best adapted screenplay . This year, best animated film may also be a superhero battle, with \u0027Incredibles 2\u0027 and \u0027Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u0027 among the favorites.But the awards campaign for \u0027Black Panther\u0027 is predicated less on its superhero DNA than on its cultural impact and on its personal nature as, despite its budget, an auteur film by one of the most widely respected young filmmakers in Hollywood. \u0027Black Panther\u0027 last week for a day played for free in arthouse theaters nationwide in an event put on by Art House Convergence and Film Comment.George H.W.

It was a journey in finding his own connection to Africa. While developing the script, he visited South Africa, Kenya and the Kingdom of Lesotho - a tiny nation that inspired Coogler\u0027s Wakanda.\u0027In simple terms, the film is what brought me to the continent,\u0027 says Coogler. \u0027It was kind of a lifelong thing just to get there and see it. The thing that I found was a sense of identity as an African person. I found in those trips and through that research a definition for myself of what it means to be African. That was a question I was seeking as a filmmaker.\u0027Coogler had a sense he wasn\u0027t alone in wanting that connection, that others felt a need for it, too. \u0027But,\u0027 he says, \u0027I could never imagine to the extent that it did.\u0027\u0027Black Panther\u0027 arrived to feverish enthusiasm and debuted in the most resplendent and regal Hollywood premiere of the decade. It has been called \u0027a defining moment for Black America,\u0027 pop-culture myth-making at its best and the best big-budget studio epic in ages. Parents took their kids and kids took their parents in a groundbreaking generational event. Theaters were rented out. It was the No. 1 film at the U.S. box office for five straight weeks.\u0027We always saw it as a film to watch with your loved ones, with your friends and with strangers, in communal settings,\u0027 says Coogler. \u0027People are still interested in doing that and it feels fortunate.\u0027In a year where Netflix has a formidable Oscar contender in Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s \u0027Roma,\u0027 and fears of the diminishing of the theatrical experience pervade the industry, that may be the most appealing reason for academy members to vote for \u0027Black Panther\u0027: It proved the still-vibrant, earth-shattering power of the movie theater.

Pictured: Yoko in the studio with the Beatles (pictured in 1969)          But by 1972, the \u0027dazzle had gone out of their lives\u0027. The only way out Yoko could see was to get John a mistress and she set up the relationship with May Pang, 22, (pictured with John in the 1970s) a beautiful Chinese girl who had been working for the coupleTheir relationship would lead to suffocation for John and he talked of orce while Yoko had found her métier running the iconic British band\u0027s empire.\u0027Her detractors, however, and there are many, point to some clever plotting and attention-seeking behavior on her behalf\u0027, writes Connolly. \u0027A little-known avant-garde artist who was wishing to make a name for herself in a new country could do no better than by finding a way of association with the Beatles, and especially John Lennon, whose every action was newsworthy and was now rich enough to be a very important person\u0027.The Beatles lived in a feel-good party bubble for two years after finishing their first North American tour in the summer of 1964.           Author Ray Connolly writes in Being John Lennon: A Restless Life that Yoko found a way to make a name for herself through John Lennon was already taking Preludin, an amphetamine, to keep up the intense booking schedule, as well as drinking alcohol.When Bob Dylan introduced the band to marijuana, consumption quickly progressed to smoking it for breakfast.LSD became John\u0027s next drug of choice and he took acid while reading a book by Timothy Leary about destroying your ego.Lennon\u0027s drug habits caused him to start panicking about death threats to the group, who were then confined to their hotel while touring.When crowds started spitting at them, the band decided it was time to \u0027give rock a rest.\u0027\u0027It was f***ing humiliation,\u0027 John said. \u0027One has to completely humiliate oneself to be what the Beatles were.\u0027The whole Beatle thing was just beyond comprehension. I was eating and drinking like a pig, and I was as fat as a pig\u0027.\u0027The Ku Klux Klan had nailed Beatles albums to burning crosses and radio stations began to ban the playing of Beatles records,\u0027 writes the author.\u0027To John, ever dissatisfied with the way things were, the idea of a spiritual rebirth, a starting again, was always attractive\u0027.The group went their separate ways - George went to India, Paul composed music for a movie, Ringo took a holiday and John went to Spain before returning to London.          The Beatles (above in 1965) lived in a feel-good party bubble for two years after making their first North American tour in summer of 1964. Lennon was already taking Preludin, an amphetamine, to keep up the intense booking schedule, as well as drinking alcohol          Yoko, a heroin addict, turned up in Lennon\u0027s (pictured in 1969) life during a time when he was seeking a spiritual rebirth and turned him onto her drug of choice, and she would eventually be instrumental in breaking up the BeatlesEnter Yoko Ono, who always claimed that their meeting at the Indica Gallery in London was \u0027purely by accident\u0027.John had been dropped off at the gallery by owner John Dunbar. He viewed the art as a con and suspected that he was being hustled to buy something.Downstairs he was introduced to \u0027a very small Japanese lady wearing a black sweater and black trousers, peering out from between two curtain folds of long black hair\u0027.She was preparing her exhibition opening the following day and was in London with her current husband and child, Kyoko.Yoko claimed she hadn\u0027t recognized John \u0027although she had insisted to Dunbar that a Beatle be invited\u0027, writes the author.One of her art pieces was a board with a chain and a hammer hanging on it and a bunch of nails at the bottom.John asked: \u0027Can I hammer a nail in it\u0027? \u0027No\u0027, she said and walked away.She came back and asked for five shillings. Lennon had no money on him and said he would give her five imaginary shillings to hammer in an imaginary nail.She later contacted Lennon and asked him for an original music score for a short film. He sent lyrics to one of the Beatles\u0027 songs but John didn\u0027t know that she had initially asked Paul who refused her request.\u0027Yoko had broken into the orbit of the Beatles\u0027, writes the author.A few weeks after the Indica Gallery meeting, she showed up at the Beatles\u0027 office in Mayfair hoping to speak to John.She wanted financial backing to wrap the statues of the lions in Trafalgar Square in canvas.          Yoko had John finance her art project that featured a room that had half of every object. Pictured: Yoko sitting in her \u0027half bedroom\u0027 in 1968          Yoko has always claimed that she met John at the Indica Gallery in London \u0027purely by accident\u0027. Yoko claimed she hadn\u0027t recognized John \u0027although she had insisted to Dunbar that a Beatle be invited\u0027, writes the author. Pictured: The couple in 1971In John\u0027s absence, she pitched the idea to Ringo who was \u0027non plussed --- and commented she might just as well have been speaking in Japanese for the little he understood of her plan\u0027.\u0027From the very beginning of her career, she understood the power of networking and self-promotion especially self-promotion,\u0027 according to Connolly, a veteran journalist and screenwriter who John befriended in the late 1960s.Yoko\u0027s next move was to send John a copy of her self-published book of \u0027instructional poems\u0027 called Grapefruit.One poem was: \u0027Stir inside of your brains with a penis until things are mixed up. Take a walk. Smoke everything you can, including your pubic hair\u0027.John \u0027felt that she was the star and he the audience\u0027.He hadn\u0027t felt that for a long time. She was an enigma to him. Never had he met anyone like this \u0027odd little Japanese woman dressed in her black intellectual\u0027s uniform,\u0027 writes the author.In the summer of 1967, the Sgt. Pepper album was released, while John was still high on LSD and feeling \u0027needles of jealousy\u0027 towards Paul for his clever songwriting.Beatles manager Brian Epstein was dead of an accidental overdose of sleeping pills, leaving John feeling guilty having introduced his old friend to pills.John knew years earlier that Epstein, openly gay, had fallen in love with him. It made John question his own sexuality and he once let Brian pleasure him him but then he later turned on him and called him a \u0027queer Jew\u0027. Throughout all of this, Yoko was writing letters to John, getting under his skin and suddenly was everywhere he was.She even showed up at a meeting that John, Paul and Jane Asher had with a yogi in the Indian Himalayas.          Throughout all of this, Yoko was writing letters to John (pictured in 1969), getting under his skin and suddenly was everywhere he was. She even showed up at a meeting that Paul and Jane Asher had with a yogi in the Indian HimalayasYoko wrote John multiple times a week while he was in India. He collected the letters at the post office so his wife, Cynthia, would be none the wiser.Yoko never quit the chase and John made up his mind to orce Cynthia, his high school Brigitte Bardot fantasy, and leave his wife and child for Yoko. Yoko, seven years John\u0027s senior, was born in Tokyo, her father a wealthy banker and a Christian, her mother a Buddhist. When her father was posted to a position in the U.S. and the family moved to Scarsdale, New York, Yoko enrolled at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers but dropped out after meeting a Japanese composer, Toshi Ichiyanagi, studying at the Julliard School, a performing arts conservatory.They were married and with little money, Yoko waitressed to support her bohemian lifestyle and her conceptualist art.\u0027If she received any reviews at all, they were usually critical, but criticism and rejection never stopped her\u0027, writes the author. \u0027Her belief in herself was total\u0027.She had affairs during that short-lived marriage and the couple separated with Yoko returning to Japan and putting on one of her conceptual art \u0027events\u0027.Failing to ignite any excitement, she was institutionalized by her husband and family after overdosing on sleeping pills.American filmmaker, Tony Cox pursued Yoko in Japan and helped her get out of the hospital. She got pregnant, quickly orced Toshi and married Cox.Cox delivered the baby at home and continued to do most of the childcare for their daughter.

She made suggestions in a field she knew nothing about.She was staging her own \u0027events\u0027 that critics viewed as \u0027Yoko\u0027s vanity projects that John was funding. Interest in them was low to non-existent,\u0027 writes the author.John sued Cynthia for orce citing adultery, a charge later withdrawn and reversed to John\u0027s uncontested adultery.Now he could marry Yoko but she was still married to Cox who had originally encouraged Yoko to pursue John as an art patron and she owed him a lot of money.          Inseparable, John insisted that Yoko be at all recording sessions –inhibiting to the other Beatles and helped escalate the final demise of the band. Pictured: John and Yoko in one of the last photos of John before he was shot dead in 1980 \u0027He got her out of the mental hospital in Japan, he kept her going, raised money for her shows...went after all the publicity, found backers for her films, borrowed money from banks...\u0027 writes the author, and now she was dumping him for someone rich and famous.John was blinded by Yoko and saw her as the most intelligent woman he had ever met as well as being very beautiful.The workforce at Apple Records didn\u0027t like Yoko and remembered her as \u0027a very pushy broad with not an ounce of humble in her\u0027.Mimi, John\u0027s aunt, told a reporter, \u0027I didn\u0027t like the look of her from the start\u0027. \u0027My God, what\u0027s that?\u0027 she said on first sight and dubbed her \u0027the poisoned dwarf\u0027.Little did Mimi know at the time that Yoko introduced heroin to John who began sniffing it regularly. John and Yoko were busted for hash, traces of marijuana and half a gram of morphine. John\u0027s own arrest didn\u0027t phase him. \u0027I was stoned all the time and just didn\u0027t give a s**t\u0027, he told Connelly.He was so stoned, he no longer cared about the once magical writing relationship with McCartney.While John was \u0027lost in the glow of love\u0027, he never recognized that Yoko was generating ill from fans and the general public who hated her music.

Yoko phoned John a dozen times a day still high on heroinThey just didn\u0027t like her – and neither did the other Beatles who wanted to get the group back to being only four. \u0027I think you\u0027re both nuts, the pair of you\u0027, Ringo told John.Yoko had driven a wedge between John and Paul as well as into the management battle and the new agent asking for a larger percentage.Life at the Dakota apartment building on Manhattan\u0027s Upper West Side where the couple lived turned into suffocation for the Beatle. John spent hours sleeping or staring mutely at the TV.\u0027The dazzle had gone out of their lives\u0027, writes the author. The myth of perfect love evaporated by 1972.The only way out Yoko could see was to get John a mistress and she set up the relationship with May Pang, 22, a beautiful Chinese girl who had been working for the couple.The pair escaped to Los Angeles and stayed together for eighteen months.Yoko phoned John a dozen times a day.John was now happier than he had been in years --- until Yoko rang saying she had found a cure for John\u0027s cigarette smoking – hypnotism and that could only take place at the Dakota.May wasn\u0027t invited to the session and off John went in January 1975.John never revealed what transpired during the session but he became quite ill and the author suggests some kind of aversion therapy transpired.John saw May on the sly but he was back in the grip of Yoko.          \u0027She was more than a wife to him. She was more like a mother. \u0027Perhaps that was why he began to call her Mother\u0027. Pictured: John and Yoko in November of 1980 \u0027She had needed him for his fame and the cachet it gave her, for his money and the limousines. She made him feel clever and not just a rock and roller. Now as she ran the Dakota apartment and staff, and sat in his place on the Apple board, she seemed to offer to bring order to his life\u0027, writes Connolly.\u0027She was more than a wife to him. She was more like a mother. \u0027Perhaps that was why he began to call her Mother\u0027.She took control of all of John\u0027s finances and became his manager.But his muse was dried up and for the next four years, John was rarely seen in public.He had nowhere to go, no one to see and spent time watching Dumbo cartoons with their young son, Sean.He became anorexic thin and was sure that the FBI was listening in on all his calls. No calls from friends were put through to him. \u0027Yoko has him all locked up\u0027, Mick Jagger said.\u0027Yoko had found her métier in life – she ran the busy Lennon empire\u0027 – according to whether or not Mercury was in retrograde.Lennon\u0027s days were spent living on the fringes of \u0027a world that Yoko was running without him\u0027.It was only when John went on a stormy sailing trip from Cape Town, South Africa to Bermuda that he regained his self-confidence and sense of self-worth.On his return he was ready to write and record again. But it wasn\u0027t to be.John was shot dead by Mark David Chapman on December 8, 1980 outside of the Dakota.Thirty-eighty years after the crime, Chapman remains in Attica State Prison. Ray Connolly\u0027s Being John Lennon: A Restless Life is available here. "},{"url":null,"title":"None family allowed near Piers Morgan doubles criticism Meghan Markle","story":"    Britain\u0027s Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and his wife Meghan Markle.

Above: A female biker clad in leather revs her Triumph racer outside the Houses of Parliament           Make Love Not War: For an emerging generation of politically conscious youths, global injustices became national talking points. The Vietnam War, seen by many to be as unnecessary as it was brutal, became a focus of political anger, spread through university campuses and on to the streets.

As It Was is Habicht\u0027s treasure-chest of the swinging, groovy, hippie, and psychedelic Sixties in London. It offers an eye-opening contribution to the history of a country that is currently undergoing yet more social transformation          When the German photographer (above) arrived in London in the 1960s, the pop revolution was still in the starting blocks.

Challenging the traditional conservative values of older generations, the Swinging Sixties saw women embracing their bodies and pushing against expectations of modesty and sexual subservience. The counterculture rejected the mores of post-Victorian Britain with an ethos that encouraged communal living, artistic experimentation, and a harmony with nature          The capital became known as Swinging London and the places to be were Carnaby Street, the King\u0027s Road and Kensington. The baby-boomers had come of age and with the end of National Service in 1960 and with economic recovery they had more freedom and disposable income than their parents.

It was stupid money.\u0027Jean Batchelor, a 77-year-old local, said the betting boss is also causing family rifts – because children want to sell and take the big money on the table but their parents want to stay put.Mrs Coates is no stranger to controversy.She has been accused of \u0027living off the misery of others\u0027 with critics calling her earnings \u0027obscene\u0027 and \u0027disgusting\u0027, after it emerged the number of problem gamblers aged 11 to 16 had quadrupled in two years to 55,000.Labour MP Jonathan Ashworth said: \u0027From gambling to alcohol to drug misuse we face an addiction crisis.\u0027Services are slashed, mental health services neglected. Lives are ruined while the CEO of a betting company is paid 22 times more than the whole industry \u0027donates\u0027 to treatment.

Ms Wellgreen lived with her former partner, 38-year-old taxi driver Ben Lacomba (pictured) in the leafy Kent village of New Ash GreenSarah was already in bed, he says, and made no mention of going out again. She was excited about a new, well-paid job she\u0027d just secured and her plans for the future.The following morning, Neil sent a text: \u0027Morning, honey, how are you?\u0027 When it failed to deliver, he put it down to a flat mobile battery. But as later calls to her mobile went unanswered, he grew increasingly frantic. Panicked, he called Sarah\u0027s sons from a previous marriage, Lewis, 22, and Jack, 21, to ask if they\u0027d heard from her. They couldn\u0027t reach their mum either. And no one has heard from her since.Sarah was reported missing on October 11, with police now treating the case as a \u0027potential murder\u0027 and describing her disappearance as completely out of character.\u0027I don\u0027t think I will ever see Sarah alive again,\u0027 says Neil. \u0027Not after all these weeks.\u0027 Existing on adrenaline and cigarettes, Neil says he is desperate for some kind of resolution.A orced father of two children — a son, nine, and a girl aged three — Neil says his daughter was staying with him on the night of his last conversation with Sarah, and keeps asking about her.Neil is speaking now, in the hope of jogging the memory in the mind of someone — anyone — who might unwittingly hold the clue to her disappearance.\u0027Sarah would never have left her children. She adored them. Something terrible must have happened to her, and not knowing is torture,\u0027 he says, describing the past few weeks in limbo as \u0027heartbreaking\u0027.\u0027My children loved her.

But he can\u0027t cry or grieve for her until he knows for certain.Since Sarah went missing, hundreds of volunteers have scoured woods near her home and around Kent. Divers have searched the Thames and River Darent, near Dartford.Detectives have studied more than 2,000 hours of CCTV footage and searched her home, but are still no closer to finding her.She vanished without trace, leaving behind her 4WD Hyundai Santa Fe SUV and bank cards, which remain unused to this day. Her black iPhone cannot be located it is either switched off or the battery is dead.The CCTV outside Sarah\u0027s home was switched off on the night she went missing, so her last movements remain unknown.A devoted mum, she missed her son\u0027s 13th birthday — two days after her disappearance — something her family say would be unthinkable.On October 16, a man in his 30s — reportedly Ben Lacomba — was arrested and, after three days in custody, released on bail until November 16, pending further investigation. His bail was later extended until the new year.On November 4, grainy CCTV footage emerged of a hooded motorist acting suspiciously in Greenhithe, Kent, five days after Sarah\u0027s disappearance. The images show a man spending eight minutes in an area near the Thames, leaving a Vauxhall Zafira parked in a side street while he walks towards the riverbank.  This grainy CCTV images of a hooded man and a car parked near a river may provide vital clues in the \u0027potential murder\u0027 of missing mother Sarah Wellgreen The footage triggered a police search of mudflats which, as far as we know, yielded nothing. The man has never been identified.Kent police, meanwhile, renewed their appeal for people who may have been within a five-mile radius of the Bazes Shaw area of New Ash Green the night Sarah disappeared, or the following morning, to come forward.Neil James has issued his own Facebook appeal urging anyone with CCTV or dashcam footage to contact the police, even with the tiniest of details they may think insignificant.As he now tells his story for the first time in depth, the complexities of the riddle faced by detectives could not be more apparent. From the outset, the investigation has centred on Sarah\u0027s complicated personal life. Her disappearance is set against a backdrop of past fractured relationships and searches for love through internet dating.Neil and twice-orced Sarah met in late 2016 through a dating website after she had separated from Mr Lacomba, father of her three youngest children, a son aged 12 and six-year-old twins, a boy and girl.Sarah had moved from the £330,000 four-bedroom family home in Kent, to Portsmouth — more than 100 miles away — where she owned a property and worked part-time at a beauty salon. Her mother, stepfather, and two adult sons from a previous marriage, to whom she was close, also lived in the city.\u0027Sarah was warm, loving and very attractive,\u0027 recalls Neil, who spent weeks talking to her by phone before they met. \u0027She was pretty, voluptuous, smiley and always fun.\u0027I felt I\u0027d found a kindred spirit. We were looking for something serious. Yes, it was complicated, but we understood each other,\u0027 says Neil, who invited Sarah to his flat for a meal on their first date.\u0027It was shortly before Christmas and my son was staying with me, so it wasn\u0027t easy to go out or arrange dates,\u0027 says Neil, whose flat was a 40-minute drive from Portsmouth.\u0027Sarah walked in and immediately started to help my son decorate the tree. She just had this special bond with children. I was completely bowled over by her, head over heels.\u0027          Neil James (pictured with Ms Wellgreen) has issued his own Facebook appeal urging anyone with CCTV or dashcam footage to contact the police           In the post on Facebook Neil James urged people to jog their memories to when she disappeared on October  9           Kent Police Tactical Operations Search and Marine Unit searching a lake on Tuesday near to where she vanished          Police released images showing specialist police officers and firefighters searching a water-filled drainage and ditchWhen the boiler at Sarah\u0027s Portsmouth home broke, Neil invited her and her three children to stay for Christmas until it could be fixed. \u0027We all got on so well. Sarah and her kids never really left,\u0027 says Neil, whose two children regularly stayed, too.\u0027Her daughter shared bunk beds with mine in one room, and her sons and mine shared another room. Sarah enrolled her children in the local school,\u0027 says Neil, who introduced her to his work colleagues and met her family in Portsmouth.\u0027Sarah told me she wanted to get married again before she was 50, and we talked about having a register office wedding in Guildford, followed by a big party in Majorca.\u0027But there were stresses, too. Neil says Sarah\u0027s children were close to their father and missed their old friends back in Kent.Although spacious, Neil\u0027s flat must have felt rather cramped with five young children, who were now part of an instant blended family, and no garden to play in. The speed with which Sarah and her children moved in with Neil — barely two months after they had met — also heightened disputes with her ex-partner over their children.The strain and disruption of the to-ing and fro-ing between Kent, Farnham and Portsmouth eventually took its toll.After almost 18 months together, Sarah suddenly left Neil in May 2018, apparently without warning.\u0027One morning I had a call at work from the children\u0027s school asking where they were. I phoned Sarah and she told me she\u0027d gone. She said she couldn\u0027t cope with the situation any more,\u0027 says Neil.\u0027I was heartbroken, but Sarah felt she had to put the children first. She was very stressed over the situation with her ex, and worried that she could lose her kids, and they meant everything to her.\u0027          Sarah\u0027s fiancé Neil James (pictured), 45, of Farnham, Surrey, said he spoke to her the night before she went missing on October 9As a result, Sarah decided to move back into the family home with ex-partner Ben Lacomba. It was, Neil understands, a temp-orary co-parenting arrangement, rather than a reconciliation. Neil says Sarah told him she and her ex-partner, who had also met someone new after splitting from Sarah, had separate bedrooms and shared the school runs. Mr Lacomba also regularly worked nights as a taxi driver.Every weekend, Sarah continued to drive to work in Portsmouth, but had ruled out moving back there with her children. She told Neil the schools were better in Kent and it would be less disruptive for them living with their dad.As far as Neil was aware, this new arrangement — though not ideal — was reasonably amicable.Could Sarah have just walked out? Had she — unbeknown to Neil — met someone new? Could she have crossed paths with a murderous stranger, or felt suidical?When she first went missing, friends and relatives suggested she\u0027d been dating other men following her break from Neil and reportedly pondered whether she\u0027d gone off with a new lover — possibly to a flat she owned in Spain.Her uncle, Ronald Wellgreen, 61, said that the last time he\u0027d seen Sarah in the summer, she\u0027d spoken about a new romance.          Sarah Wellgreen, a 46-year-old beautician, was last seen on Tuesday, October 9HE SAYS: \u0027She told me she had a new boyfriend. I saw a photo on Facebook of her with a man who looked to be in his 20s and as if he might be Turkish, though the photo was taken in the UK — that was the last picture I saw of Sarah.\u0027Martin Prus, 43, manager of the Puresun Health and Beauty Centre in Portsmouth, where Sarah worked part-time, also spoke of a man in his 30s, who looked Italian or Spanish, who picked her up from work one day in August. \u0027I\u0027m not sure if they were officially a couple or if they had just started dating, but there definitely seemed to be something between them,\u0027 he said.It was also reported that Sarah, who friends said was her normal, cheerful self just before she vanished, had visited several private clients shortly before her disappearance to give beauty treatments or sports massage.But Neil, who says he and Sarah reconciled in July, dismisses as nonsense the rumours of her seeing other men. He further rubbishes any suggestion that she wanted to end her life or start a completely new one without her children.The Mediterranean-looking gent, he claims, was the boyfriend of one of her friends who was helping Sarah with DIY at her Portsmouth home, which she was renting out.\u0027During our split, Sarah told me she\u0027d been on a couple of dates, but said one of them was only after her money and she didn\u0027t click with the other,\u0027 says Neil. \u0027We got back together because I still loved her and she realised she still loved me. She had a number of regular private clients, who were mostly women, and I\u0027ve spoken to all of them.\u0027Neil last saw Sarah two weekends before she went missing, when she stopped at his flat overnight, en route to Portsmouth.She was meant to stay the weekend of October 6, but an altercation with a colleague at the salon had upset her, so she stayed there instead to talk to her manager.\u0027She would never have gone off with someone else, leaving her children,\u0027 says Neil. \u0027To my mind, she was the perfect parent. Her kids always came first.\u0027She was really happy about her new job and she\u0027d just secured a mortgage, so that she and the kids could stay in their home and her ex-partner could live nearby.\u0027          Police search woodland and surrounding areas of Bazes Shaw, New Ash Green after Ms Wellgreen went missing around two months ago          Hundreds of volunteers and police officers have scoured woodland close to Ms Wellgreen\u0027s home in New Ash GreenNeil says he and Sarah were talking again of marriage and she was wearing her mother\u0027s old engagement ring, until they could afford a proper replacement.They hadn\u0027t set a wedding date, and Sarah vanished before they could even work out where they might live as a married couple — or how their respective children would fit into the new set-up.\u0027We\u0027d both had our fair share of relationship car crashes in the past, but were really looking forward to the future,\u0027 says Neil. \u0027Sarah was the best thing that ever happened to me, and now this?\u0027I can\u0027t bear the thought I might not see her alive again, but what\u0027s worse is that her five children — and mine — don\u0027t know where she is or what\u0027s happened to her.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Countryfile 2019 calendar reveals adorable animals seen Britain","story":"    Heaven scent: David White’s picture of a family of polecats in East Budleigh, Devon, won this year’s competition and is on the cover of the Countryfile calendar          How now, brown cow?

She talks about her early working life, encounters in public toilets and fighting the label ‘iPhone artist’If the annual Turner prize may be seen as a rough-and-ready barometer of British art and British preoccupations, this year’s exhibition gives a fairly unambiguous reading of the cultural weather. Consisting entirely of work in film, video and moving image, it is devoid of those Turner prize staples of high jinks, daft humour and goofy provocation. Instead, its subjects include state-sponsored violence, fake news and the shattering limbo of being a refugee. One of the shortlisted artists, the multi disciplinary collective Forensic Architecture, uses techniques including investigative journalism to question the accuracy of an account by the Israeli police of a confrontation that led to two deaths in a Bedouin village in the Negev Desert. Another, Naeem Mohaiemen, has offered an oddly compelling film, lasting an hour and a half, centred on the 1973 Non-Aligned Countries conference, complete with archive footage of Madame Binh and Yasser Arafat. It is serious art for serious times, and feels completely right just now.The winner, announced on Tuesday night, was the 44-year-old Glasgow-based Charlotte Prodger, for a delicate, multilayered, poetic film, shot entirely on her iPhone. Compared with other shortlisted artists, it might seem domestic, interior – but it is no less political and no less of the moment. Filmed around her flat as she recovered from surgery, and in Scotland’s forests and on its simmering grey seas, it explores her own queer identity in a way that touches on deep history, wide-open landscapes and the politics of isolation and connection, separation and union, quoting from her own diaries as well as drawing on other texts such as Julian Cope’s The Modern Antiquarian. When the prize was announced at Tate Britain in London, she sat completely still for a moment, stunned, while her proud dad leaped to his feet and cheered.Delighted and shocked, she is still trying to take in the win when we meet the next morning. The £25,000 prize money will come in handy. “I’ll be living off it – my rent, my studio rent, my living costs, my materials,” she says. Like the others who were shortlisted this year, her kind of work is not easily commodifiable. She is certainly not one of the handful of artists making a mint from the globalised art market.In her acceptance speech, Prodger made pointed reference to Scotland’s continued commitment to a free university education. Born in Bournemouth, she grew up mostly in Aberdeenshire after her father moved there to work as an engineer her mother was a secretary and researcher. She left school with two highers – not enough to get her a place at university. She took a couple of vocational courses (including one in photography) and did a variety of jobs: “I worked in a sandwich shop, a jumper shop, in the Kodak lab in a branch of Boots in Edinburgh, in call centres, doing data input, cleaning.” It was working as a life model at the Edinburgh College of Art that introduced her to artists and contemporary art. At 23, she got a portfolio together and applied to do art as a mature student. She studied at Goldsmiths in London and later, the Glasgow School of Art.Her film, Bridgit, takes its title from an ancient goddess of that name. At one point a voiceover talks of the alternative names for the deity, which, it says, have shifted over time and place. Bridgit’s is an unstable, contingent identity that nonetheless offers some hope of a matrilineal, non-patriarchal prehistory later, the film refers to the theorist, artist and writer Sandy Stone, who, via working as a sound engineer, built her own computer and worked with the lesbian separatist label Olivia Records. At another point, Prodger describes being a teenager in Aberdeenshire, working in a care home in the early 1990s, taking acid and ecstasy in her downtime, while, unknown to her, the musician and antiquary Cope was ranging over the neolithic sites of her home county, thick with standing stones and stone circles, which he described as “bang in the middle of the Great Mother’s heart”. Prodger was trying to work out how to be a young gay woman here were signs in the landscape that she had yet to read.The whole film, her most personal to date, seems to see Prodger searching for a place, feeling out of place, resisting being too carelessly placed. Her works, she says, always start with a sense of “how I want them to feel, rather than what I want them to do”. With Bridgit, she wanted it to feel subterranean. It is certainly very interior: there is a lot of material about altered states, the effects of anaesthetic, a feeling of being out-of-body. A lot about the body, in fact. There is a passage where she records her experience of public-lavatory confusions – someone yelling “There’s a boy in the girls’ toilets!” in a night club on a Caledonian MacBrayne ferry, a middle-aged woman hesitating on the threshold of the loos as she catches sight of Prodger, saying: “I thought I was in the wrong toilet there.” These episodes appear in the film without rancour, but now Prodger says that such encounters “are just relentless actually. It’s something that punctuates my life nearly every day now. It’s pervasive – though I don’t experience the levels of confusion that other queer people do. It’s exhausting, making it OK for people. I’ll be drying my hands and someone will come in and they will look embarrassed or ashamed. I feel for them. I want to make it all right for them. It’s a structural problem when everyone involved ends up feeling embarrassed.”Bridgit is a change in direction for Prodger. It is only the second work of hers in which visitors sit in the darkness and watch a large single screen. Previously, she has made multi-channel works on monitors often positioned at head height, arranged almost confrontationally in space as a sculptural installation. Watching Bridgit feels like being in Prodger’s head, or in her dreams. It opens with a view of her feet propped up on the sofa the camera rises and falls in time with her breathing. You never see her whole body, or anyone else’s. You might see a portion of her hand, or a bit of her furry hat. The self is fragmented into not just one subjectivity, but seemingly into several, offering the opposite of the certainty of a masculinist point of view. It reminds me of the Scottish poet and nature writer Nan Shepherd – a writer whom Prodger admires – saying that the better way to discover a mountain might be not to walk up it, but to walk around it, finding its secret places and crevices rather than its peaks.This intense subjectivity, or series of subjectivities, arises largely from the way it was shot – on her iPhone. Despite its shiny, glassy, factory-made optimism, the iPhone is, she says, “a filthy format – smeared and grubby”, almost an extension of her own body. She films all the time, as life goes on. Part of the split of her nature is a love of friends, and a desire for solitude – the phone means no crew, no hassle and complete privacy. At times Bridgit has a passing family resemblance to that most ubiquitous of domestic phone outputs, the cat video (a black cat huddles in the warmth and light offered by a desk lamp, Don Cherry playing in the background).She doesn’t like, however, being labelled an “iPhone artist”. “It’s just not a thing for me,” she says. “For me, it’s just another format.” In her time she has shot on everything from 16mm to HD, and has ransacked old TV footage from the internet. She is interested in playing with the possibilities of these different formats. Shooting on iPhone has coincided with making her first single-channel works, which is a case of form and content coming together (previous work using a 4:3 ratio rather than the 16:9 of the iPhone was more suited to being shown on TV monitors). In any case, she says: “I’ve moved through a number of different formats just because I’m 44 and technology has changed.”She is not into digital as such, and indeed, claims to be an utter technophobe. “I can’t use WhatsApp, and I don’t really know what the Cloud is. My girlfriend has to set everything up on my phone for me.” At the same time, she enjoys working within the parameters and limitations of the iPhone (“I can’t cope with a lot of options,” she says), and will continue to use it for her next major work, which will be a film for the Venice Biennale next year, where she will represent Scotland. But she won’t do so slavishly. “In the Venice film there will be some things that the phone won’t be able to capture, so I’ll use video,” she says. A rare hint of irritation enters her gentle, peaceable, musical voice. “I just sometimes think: ‘Just stop talking about the iPhone.’”The Turner prize is at Tate Britain, London, until 6 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48ddba3a822140c6b443398adbde5132f8f250c4/0_0_2333_3500/master/2333.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3c2a63e67511e22ee1b7b36bd8d01ab 660w","title":"sir terry morgan resigns as chairman of crossrail and hs2","story":"Decision comes after he predicted he would be sacked from both roles ‘within days’Sir Terry Morgan, the chairman of Crossrail and HS2, who last week predicted he would be sacked from both roles “within days” due to delays and cost overruns, has resigned.The Department for Transport said Morgan, who became chairman of Crossrail in 2009 but had been in charge of HS2 for only four months, had stepped down from the senior posts.Morgan had become embroiled in a public row with the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, over Crossrail, an east-west railway through the capital that was due to open this year but is now delayed until 2019.The pair clashed after Morgan claimed Khan knew as early as late July that Crossrail would not be ready on time. The mayor insisted he did not know of the delay until shortly before the postponement was announced on 31 August. The estimated final cost of Crossrail has ballooned this year by £600m to £15.4bn, forcing Transport for London (TfL) to borrow £350m.Whitehall sources said the increase, announced shortly after Morgan took over at HS2, was among factors that convinced the government he was the wrong man to lead the construction of the UK’s second high-speed rail line.Morgan said last week that he expected to be sacked within days, just four months after the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said he would bring “world-class leadership” to the high-speed rail project.HS2 is slated to cost £55.7bn but has been subject to criticism and mounting concerns about cost overruns such as those that have dogged Crossrail. It is believed that Grayling and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, have since declared they have no confidence in Morgan’s chairmanship and urged the prime minister to remove him.Grayling said: “Sir Terry has been an integral part of Crossrail for almost a decade and I would like to thank him for his dedication and the expertise he brought to the role. I am also grateful to him for his work as chair of HS2 Ltd.”The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: “While the boss of HS2 has resigned, passengers and taxpayers will be asking why the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has not accepted any responsibility and why he is still in post.“Once again the Tories are proving themselves incapable of providing the leadership to deliver infrastructure investment on time or on budget.”Morgan will be replaced at HS2 by Allan Cook, a chartered engineer, former chief executive of Cobham and former government adviser.“It is a privilege to be asked to take on this crucial role on the UK’s biggest infrastructure project,” Cook said. “HS2 will transform Britain through the creation of jobs and skills across UK industry. It will improve connectivity and passenger experience as well as creating value for the UK economy.”A successor at Crossrail, which is overseen by Transport for London, is yet to be found."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08269dc241b0d12ab14b967388062d8955d7f6cb/0_574_4372_2623/master/4372.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51ab63e9e43cc4d37f4b8f6dadcdc0c1","title":"rios squatter communities turn derelict buildings into homes in pictures","story":"As the city’s homeless population has grown, squatting projects have become more organised in an attempt to secure abandoned houses as homes for the poor.

But the document, published today, does spell problems out in uncomfortably stark terms.No one is surprised to learn that the UK would not have a power unilaterally to dissolve “backstop” arrangements designed to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. That is what the backstop always meant. Still, it aggravates Brexiter displeasure to see the government’s own lawyer write that rule-taking alignment with the EU would “endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement took its place”.The published text makes the prime minister’s task in persuading MPs to back the deal that much harder, but that was no reason for it to have been secret. There is no constitutional principle that the prime minister must be spared embarrassment. Mrs May’s preference that the document not be shared was a point of self-serving political interest, not national interest. But there was, in the government’s resistance to publication, the kernel of a genuine dilemma. Parliamentary sovereignty can sometimes collide with the entitlement of ministers to receive advice in confidence that remains confidential.Transparency makes for better government, but transparency is not necessarily improved by a requirement to publish everything under all circumstances. If ministers expect their every written word to be shared with the widest possible audience, they will stop writing things down. Informal, un-minuted policymaking is not healthy for a democracy that expects matters of significance to be recorded. Those records make politicians more accountable for their mistakes and misdeeds.In this case, it was right that Mrs May’s government was held in contempt of parliament for refusing to publish that which the Commons had demanded to see. It should also never have required such an extreme measure. Labour’s Hilary Benn expressed succinctly the problem in the Commons – matters had escalated, the chair of the Brexit select committee said, as a result of “government’s marked reluctance to listen to the house, to trust the house and to share information with the house”. Last year, Mr Benn’s committee spent months trying to establish what risk assessments the government had made for different Brexit scenarios and then asking to see them. It met delay and denial. It is worth recalling that Mrs May did not initially think that parliament had a role in the activation of article 50 and was forced to seek Commons consent by a ruling of the supreme court. The provision of a “meaningful” parliamentary vote on final Brexit terms also had to be forced out of a reluctant Downing Street.This pattern reflects the closed methods of a prime minister who avoids sharing much beyond a tight circle of advisers. It is also a function of her having no majority. Fear of humiliation in whipped votes led the government to stop contesting opposition day debates, the theory being that Labour victories on non-binding motions are less shaming if the Tories don’t put up a fight. That tactic has backfired. This week’s defeats express more than opposition among MPs to Mrs May’s approach to Brexit. They are the culmination of brewing anger at her systematic disrespect for the legislature. The contempt is now mutual, a state of affairs that would be damaging to any prime minister with a majority. For this prime minister in a hung parliament it could be fatal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bec5a043493651e1acd4e321017b4e5ca712acd2/0_0_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2133accb0bbb9e550e002d0ffe7c913","title":"macron clinton blair backlash","story":"The French president has cut taxes for the rich but maintained austerity. It’s a failed formulaRioting in the streets. Filling stations running out of fuel. Panic buying in the supermarkets. A country in chaos. Not a dystopian vision of Britain after Brexit, but France in the here and now under that self-styled champion of anti-populism, Emmanuel Macron.Comparisons with De Gaulle have certainly been made in recent days, but not to the De Gaulle who set up a French government-in-exile in London in 1940, or the De Gaulle who healed the wounds over Algeria in 1958. Inevitably, given the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) protests that have erupted across France, it is the occupation of the streets of Paris by students and workers in May 1968 that is being recalled.Like De Gaulle, Macron failed to spot the street protests coming. Like De Gaulle, he seemed out of touch and incapable of a suitable response. And like De Gaulle, he will pay a heavy political price because his USP was that he would never surrender to protesters if they took to the streets and, by suspending higher taxes on petrol and diesel for six months, he has done precisely that.There is no little irony in the fact that the man who was seen as the answer to populism has provoked the most high-profile demonstration of populist rage Europe has yet seen. When he arrived at the Elysée Palace, Macron was hailed as a new breed of politician but he was really the past, not the future: the last technocratic centrist in the tradition of Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and Gerhard Schröder.Angela Merkel’s predecessor as German chancellor was the real role model for Macron, because it was Schröder who pushed through tough labour market and welfare reforms in the early 2000s designed to make Europe’s biggest economy more competitive. The reforms worked, but only after a fashion. Germany has low unemployment and runs a huge trade surplus, but does because German workers have accepted wage cuts and reduced spending power.Macron thought the same recipe would work in France, but although he saw off Marine Le Pen easily enough in the presidential runoff, his underlying support was always weak. France chooses its leader in a two-stage process: a first round with multiple candidates and a second round when the two candidates with the highest number of votes go head to head. There is a saying that France chooses in the first round and eliminates in the second, and barely more than one in four of those who voted in round one wanted Macron.Nonetheless, the new president thought he had a powerful mandate for structural reform. He cut taxes for the rich, made it easier for companies to hire and fire, and took on the rail unions. It was only a matter of time before the backlash began.The French economy has struggled to keep pace with Germany’s. It has only very limited powers to stimulate demand because interest rates are set by the European Central Bank, and fiscal policy – tax and public spending – is constrained by the eurozone’s budget deficit rules. France supported the idea of the euro because it imagined a common currency would dilute German power. Instead, the opposite has happened: Germany has become the dominant force in the eurozone and in the wider EU. The euro works for Germany – or, to be more accurate, it works for German exporters – but it doesn’t really work for anybody else. Having made a blunder of historic proportions when it joined the single currency, France has been trying to rectify the mistake ever since.While he was still in his honeymoon period as president, Macron announced a plan to strengthen monetary union by creating a eurozone budget controlled by the eurozone. He knew that the only chance of Berlin agreeing to this proposal was if Germany saw its relationship with France as a partnership of equals, something it has not been for many years. The way to generate respect was to put the French economy through the same rigorous workout that the Germans had accepted under Schröder. This had the added benefit of chiming with his domestic agenda, which was all about creating a more business-friendly environment and shifting the balance of power in the workplace from labour to capital.The Germans were always going to take some persuading, both about the desirability of having a eurozone-wide fiscal policy that they would be expected to bankroll and about whether Macron could deliver at home. The worst street violence in half a century will have confirmed all their worst fears. But there’s a wider point. Politicians need to realise that the financial crisis and a decade of flatlining living standards have made a difference to what is and what isn’t politically feasible.It is feasible – indeed, desirable – to use the tax system to tackle climate change, but only if the hit to living standards is fully offset by cuts in other taxes. Otherwise it is simply more of the austerity that voters everywhere are rejecting. And it is politically suicidal to be known as the president of the wealthy and then tell voters angry about rising fuel prices to car share or take public transport. That’s not De Gaulle, that’s Marie Antoinette and “let them eat cake”.• Larry Elliott is the ’s economics editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37aae3892bb30b1c3f4b3da1547ce7251b3104ad/0_146_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e10ba3612fcc4345df514d96df6cfd6","title":"ucl launches inquiry into historical links with eugenics","story":"Staff and students want UCL to remove name of ‘father of eugenics’ Francis Galton from university buildingsUniversity College London has launched an inquiry into its historical links with eugenics, following pressure from students and staff.It emerged in January that conferences on eugenics and intelligence had been run secretly at the university for at least three years by James Thompson, an honorary senior lecturer at UCL. Speakers included white supremacists and a researcher who has previously advocated child rape.Toby Young, the head of the government-backed New Schools Network, stepped down as director of the new Office for Students shortly after it was revealed that he had attended the last of these conferences in May 2017.The university, which was unaware of the existence of these meetings, has now severed all links with Thompson, as well as tightening up its room-booking systems.Thompson declined to comment this week, but wrote in a recent blog that he had been forced to keep the UCL meetings secret because speakers were worried that discussions about “group differences” could face “hostile interruptions and damage their careers”. He also argued that “scientific truths” about racial difference could not be deemed racist.But UCL’s links with eugenics started long before these conferences. Sir Francis Galton, the Victorian scientist who is known as the father of eugenics, left his personal collection and archive to the university, as well as an endowment that funded the country’s first professorial chair of eugenics.The new inquiry will question whether buildings should still be named after Galton and other leading eugenicists.UCL’s students’ union wants Galton’s name stripped from a lecture theatre and a laboratory. It is campaigning for all of the university’s teaching materials to be “decolonised”.Mahmud Rahman, the union’s democracy, operations and community officer, welcomed the inquiry and said: “UCL’s history in relation to eugenics is deeply troubling for us and our members.”UCL’s president, Prof Michael Arthur, said the university had decided to examine its historical links to eugenics because the issue “causes considerable concern among many members of our community”.He added: “We both hear and recognise the sensitivities around eugenics – particularly surrounding the work of Francis Galton – and we look forward to receiving the panel’s recommendations.”But academics outside UCL stressed that the inquiry must not be used as a sticking plaster to avoid addressing bigger issues about racial equality on campus.Kalwant Bhopal, professor of education and social justice at Birmingham University, said: “I think it’s hugely important for universities to acknowledge their past actions, but it must lead to some real change, rather than simply being rhetoric.”Pratik Chakrabarti, professor of the history of science, technology and medicine at Manchester University, said: “I feel just having a go at Galton or the eugenic past of UCL is not terribly effective, unless we link these questions to what is happening with the great class and race ide in our society.”Meanwhile, some scientists are horrified that Galton, whose other contributions to science included creating psychometric testing and the statistical concept of correlation, might be erased from UCL.Niall McCrae, a senior lecturer in mental health nursing at King’s College London, said: “Galton was one of the greatest British scientists of all time, who put psychology on a proper scientific footing. You’ve got to understand the figure in the context of the time in which he was working. To link him with the Nazis is an horrific sentimentalist slur.”He added: “Nowadays in universities there is a culture of completely overturning people who were once celebrated.”Iyiola Solanke, professor of EU law and social justice at Leeds University, will lead the inquiry. It will report next summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30b1bfbe6011701fc9ffb943d35ef71cce5e0cd3/0_161_4961_2976/master/4961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=266101184c3beb0fca2578e6fc86f85f","title":"why do dyslexic students do worse at university","story":"Too many university staff are sceptical about dyslexia diagnoses, and fail to give students the support they needUnfortunately, outdated attitudes towards dyslexia among university staff prevail. Too many view it as something made up by middle-class “helicopter parents” to gain unfair advantages for their children entering university, and not the valid medical diagnosis that it actually is. Even where it is accepted as a condition rooted in an inability to match spoken sounds with their written forms, the accommodations made to level the playing field for dyslexic students are often inadequate.So how do we close the dyslexia attainment gap? We need a determined effort on the part of UK universities to make their institutions more dyslexia-friendly across the board. Lecturers can help by thinking more carefully about the effectiveness of their teaching and assessment methods for all of their students. For example, how many university teachers are familiar with research showing that the reading accuracy of dyslexic students can be significantly improved by using fonts such as Helvetica, Courier and Arial?Equally, dyslexic students indicated in a survey I recently carried out at the University of Exeter that they highly value being given teaching materials in advance of sessions, and not being overloaded with information. They also wanted variety in both teaching and assessment methods, access to marking criteria written in plain English and, most importantly of all, easy access to recordings of teaching sessions, so that they can digest teaching materials at a suitable pace.Every year, students with undiagnosed dyslexia arrive at UK universities. The number of these missed diagnoses could be greatly reduced if institutions received support to cover the costs of professional dyslexia assessment. Clear procedures would enable lecturers to refer students they suspect have undiagnosed dyslexia for a timely dyslexia screening. Universities can also establish guidelines for teaching staff, so that there is greater awareness of their specific needs. They should be monitoring the implementation of action plans for dyslexic students to ensure that they receive necessary adjustments in all of their modules.Given that dyslexia is a highly variable condition, and one better thought of as a continuum than a categorical diagnosis, it is not possible to specify in advance which accommodations iniduals might need. What we do know is that promoting a wider range of accommodations will help level the uneven playing field for dyslexic students."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb7536adf76b6e7bfb5f29f69dace7270251bd40/0_207_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee8b1618176d55f5432e420a9d70ed7","title":"how do you spend your time when youre stuck at home in winter","story":"With long nights and wet weather we’d like to hear how you stop yourself from going stir-crazy when you’re stuck at homeFrom Almaty to Zagreb, from London (England) to London (Ontario), the days are getting colder, the nights are getting longer and the clouds are getting lower.How do you cope when you can’t face the gloom, the rain, the wind or the snow, yet have already spent far too many hours at home?

It means emissions are heading in the opposite direction to the deep cuts urgently needed, say scientists, to fight climate change.The rise is due to the growing number of cars on the roads and a renaissance of coal use and means the world remains on the track to catastrophic global warming. However, the report’s authors said the emissions trend can still be turned around by 2020, if cuts are made in transport, industry and farming emissions.“The global rise in carbon emissions is worrying, because to deal with climate change they have to turn around and go to zero eventually,” said Prof Corinne Le Quéré, at the University of East Anglia,who led the research published in the journal Nature. “We are not seeing action in the way we really need to. This needs to change quickly.”The current Paris agreement pledges from nations will only limit global warming to 3C, while even a rise of 1.5C will be disastrous for many people, according to the world’s scientists. The International Energy Agency’s data also shows rising emissions in 2018. Its executive director, Fatih Birol, said: “This turnaround should be another warning to governments as they meet in Katowice this week.”“Every year of rising emissions puts economies and the homes, lives and livelihoods of billions of people at risk,” said Christiana Figueres, at the Mission 2020 campaign, who was the UN climate diplomat overseeing the Paris agreement. “We are in the age of exponentials,” she said, with renewable energy and electric cars expanding rapidly, but with the extreme weather impacts of climate change doing the same. “We have to ensure it is the solutions exponential curve that is going to win the race.”Prof David Reay, at the University of Edinburgh, UK, said: “This annual balance sheet for global carbon is comprehensive and scientifically robust. Its message is more brutal than ever: we are deep in the red and heading still deeper. For all our sakes, world leaders must now do what is required.”Harjeet Singh, at ActionAid International, said news of the emissions’ rise should galvanise those at the climate summit: “There’s way too much complacency in the air at these talks.”The “dark news” of rising emissions is merging with two other alarming trends, according to Prof David Victor, at the University of California, San Diego, in an article with colleagues also published in Nature on Wednesday.The Global Carbon Budget, produced by 76 scientists from 57 research institutions in 15 countries, found the major drivers of the 2018 increase were more coal-burning in China and India as their economies grew, and more oil used in more transport. Industry also used more gas. Renewable energy grew rapidly, but not enough to offset the increased use of fossil fuel.“There was hope China was rapidly moving away from coal power, but the last two years have shown it will not be so easy to say farewell quickly,” said Jan Ivar Korsbakken, at the Centre for International Climate Research in Norway.In the three years since the Paris agreement was signed, financial institutions have invested more than $478bn in the world’s top 120 coal plant developers, according to a report by the NGOs Urgewald, BankTrack and partners. Chinese banks led the underwriting of coal investments, while Japanese banks led the loans, the NGOs found.The global rise in emissions, even in rich, developed nations, is very concerning, said Antonio Marcondes, Brazil’s chief negotiator at the UN summit: “Emission reductions are like credit-card debt: the longer they are put off, the more expensive and painful they become.”Brazil reached its 2020 emissions targets early, but fears of a rise in deforestation under the new president, Jair Bolsonaro, could reverse this. But Le Quéré is optimistic that the rapid global rises seen in recent decades will not return: “This is very unlikely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9e5d19d078f7b04a4bad7760bcb0d4f7b6faba8/0_0_4032_3024/master/4032.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dbe14cc3c3f5e121806f2c56f8a16785 1320w","title":"a christmas less ordinary","story":"From the scorned vegetarian to the competitive card-maker, four writers reflect on their favourite bygone Christmases and unconventional traditionsOlia HerculesGrowing up in secular Soviet Union, south of Ukraine, Christmas was forbidden. My family never celebrated it. We put up our tree and opened our presents on New Year’s Eve, instead.But, when I was 10, in post-Soviet 1994, for Christmas, my family decided to take a pilgrimage to the tradition-laden Western Ukraine, a thousand kilometres away. We took a 16-hour train to get there, to discover our roots.We arrived to visit friends of friends on Christmas Eve. We were dropped off at a train station, in an outlandish location of dreams. For the first time, I saw a hill covered with a forest of Christmas trees with sparkling snow crystals.It was the mountainous area of the Carpathian Mountains.The friend of friends met us at the train station and said: “It’s not a long walk to the house, but there are no buses to take us there.” We said: “OK,” thinking it would take 10 minutes.Wrong. Little did we know, people who live in the Carpathians were used to walking or skiing everywhere. The “short walk” took an hour and a half in heavy snow.Exhausted, we finally arrived at a huge wooden house by a gushing brook, the sound of wolves howling in the distance. Inside, we were rewarded with a real traditional Ukrainian Christmas, full of colour. Guests wore beautifully made goat masks, violins were played and people were singing. The house was warm and cosy, with a roaring fire we stayed up by late into the night. We ate a traditional pescatarian feast: a mushroom borscht with wild mushroom-filled dumplings varenyky filled with potatoes and curd cheese local trout soft, yeasty buns called pyrizhky, filled with cabbage and prunes, and sweet ones filled with sweet poppyseed paste. It ended up being the most memorable Christmas of my life, and I long to recreate it.Stevie MartinWhile in most homes the giving and receiving of Christmas cards is a declining tradition, in our house – for my sister and I at least – it has evolved into a furiously fought competition. After the presents have been pored over while sat on my parents’ bed (I’m 30, my sister is 27, and we refuse to do it any other way), we give out Christmas cards. The rules are you can’t buy it from a shop, you have to make it yourself – and the loser has to make an extravagant breakfast.Gina, my sister, is an incredible artist. One year, she painted a picture of my parents. Another, she sketched an incredibly lifelike Father Christmas. Years ago, I figured out that I could win by making my parents laugh, seeing how little I could get away with. An A4 sheet of paper with a pine needle stuck on it using Sellotape above the words “HAPPY PINE-MAS”. Another year, I dribbled some gravy, drew a smiley face on it and dubbed the mess: “the gravy nativity”. Last year was blank, to represent the Holy Spirit.The only issue with this – apart from the fact that my cards get more traction than Gina’s, despite hers taking hours to create and mine taking roughly three minutes – is that I don’t know where to go after 2017’s blank card. It feels like I’ve reached the pinnacle of not caring. Do I give them no card? The world’s tiniest card? I suppose the only thing to do is go the other way – hire an artist and create an A0 canvas. Please pray for me – I’m terrible at making breakfast.Tom DugginsAs a vegetarian, Christmas sometimes feels like I’m under siege from otherwise well-intentioned friends and family who want to sneak meat into my food. If it’s not the yearly cry of “hang on, which gravy did we put the meat juices into?” (this tends to come mere seconds after covering my plate in the stuff), then there’s always the pleasure of arguing with my mum about whether the roast potatoes have to be cooked in goose fat or not. (No surprises on my position: olive oil and spuds go together like being vegetarian and only having one thing you can order on a menu.)That’s why, come 25 December, I like to focus on those parts of the traditional Christmas lunch that we can all get behind. Once the main course and pudding are all done with, there’s the vegetarian haven of the cheeseboard to look forward to.It’s like a culinary after-party taking place on your very own kitchen table. No one’s sneaking any sausage meat into the chutney or injecting pork grease into the soft cheeses and there’s no awkward discussion about who can have what, it’s just gorge time at the table and everyone’s invited.Christmas lunch tends to stress people out – getting the timings right is tough and there’s a lot of pressure overall. But with the cheese course, you’re ready to go in about five minutes: minimal effort for maximum satisfaction.Hayley CampbellAs far as I can tell, our only family Christmas tradition is pushing our oversized heads into too-small Christmas cracker hats until they split. We never wanted this tradition it was never planned. We have tried everything to get rid of it, short of having our skulls shrunk in questionable science experiments – such as balancing the hat on top of our spherical skulls and just not moving for the rest of the dinner, turning very slowly to address others at the table, the top of our bodies moving like Batman locked into his batsuit. But nothing works. The hats still split in two, or they topple into the gravy. It is an inevitability that we have given up dreading and merely succumbed to. If it’s just family at the table, we will turn the hats until the split is obvious, like a badge of big-headed honour.

His social media presence has also been a major key to his success with 34 million followers on Twitter and over 65 million on Instagram and with ratings for the ceremony continuing to spiral down, the Academy clearly hopes he’ll help draw viewers back in.After two years of straight white host Jimmy Kimmel’s rather dull shtick and after an increased push to improve the ersity of voters, choosing an African American host is also a much-needed leap forward on stage.But there’s one small catch.Hart has a rather vile history of documented homophobia, ranging from offensive standup clangers to dumb interview statements to puerile tweets to a whole embarrassing film filled with it. In 2010 during his Seriously Funny standup special, Hart delivered an extended joke based on a fear of his three-year-old son Hendrix turning out gay.One of my biggest fears is my son growing up and being gay. That’s a fear. Keep in mind, I’m not homophobic, I have nothing against gay people, be happy. Do what you want to do. But me, being a heterosexual male, if I can prevent my son from being gay, I will. Now with that being said, I don’t know if I handled my son’s first gay moment correctly. Every kid has a gay moment but when it happens, you’ve got to nip it in the bud!As his profile rose, the joke resurfaced and in a 2015 profile with Rolling Stone, he was asked to discuss it. After attempting a poorly conceived justification claiming that it’s really all about his own fears and insecurities, he then blamed the climate.“I wouldn’t tell that joke today, because when I said it, the times weren’t as sensitive as they are now,” he said. “I think we love to make big deals out of things that aren’t necessarily big deals, because we can.”What might not seem like a big deal to Hart is less amusing when given a wider context. In his extended joke, he claimed to have beaten both his son and another kid who was “grinding” up behind him at a party, something that feels particularly grotesque when viewed next to the multiple real world stories of parents beating and torturing their children to death when a so-called “gay moment” rears its head. Giovanni Melton, Gabriel Fernandez, Anthony Avalos, Ronnie Paris – just a handful of kids killed by parents because of either their perceived or confirmed homosexuality.During the same period, Hart revealed that he turned down a role in 2008’s Tropic Thunder because the character was gay and his behaviour was “real flagrant” before adding that he’d never be able to play a gay character in the future. “What I think people are going to think while I’m trying to do this is going to stop me from playing that part the way I’m supposed to,” he said.The comments preceded his role opposite Will Ferrell in Get Hard, one of the most shockingly regressive gay panic comedies in recent memory, an almost two-hour film based around a fear of anal sex. In the film, Hart helps Ferrell’s character prepare for a stint in jail but after minimal attempts to cover the specifics of prison life and protecting one’s self in a fight, a strikingly dominant phobia of male rape takes over. I wrote about it at the time:The film’s unarguably wretched low point arrives when Hart’s character takes Ferrell to a gay brunch “hookup spot” where he tells him he’ll need to learn to perform oral sex to make his time in prison easier. While being eyed up by every gay man around them, Hart informs Ferrell of the relative ease of approaching a gay stranger for sex, because “that’s what they do”. After Ferrell immediately gets the attention of the depressingly used Matt Walsh, of Veep fame, he proceeds to attempt an unsuccessful bathroom-stall tryst, which disgusts him in such graphic detail that he can’t go through with it. Meanwhile, Hart is approached by a predatory older gay man who, even after finding out Hart’s heterosexuality, refuses to take no for an answer.Now, there’s an important distinction to make here. The fear of rape is obviously legitimate and a man’s fear of being raped by another man while in prison is also understandable and by no means homophobic. It makes sense that the film would at least address this but what makes less sense is why the writers have such an obsession with the idea. It punctuates every other line of dialogue and not even in particularly inventive ways (the script is essentially multiple, exhaustive variations on “you’re going to get raped”).Hart’s response to criticism, from a gay journalist at the time, was predictably unbothered. “Funny is funny, regardless of what area it’s coming from,” he said to HitFix\u0027s Louis Virtel. The film was also released just months after The Wedding Ringer, a film described by The AV Club’s AA Dowd as “a 100-minute gay joke”.So why at a time when the Academy is desperate to show a more inclusive side would Hart seem like an appropriate host? Back in 2011, Brett Ratner was removed as Oscars producer for saying “rehearsal is for fags” – a dim-witted use of a word that he shouldn’t be using in the first place but after a quick search of Hart’s Twitter feed, it seems that it also used to be a major part of his vocabulary. Calling someone a “fat faced fag”, comparing a profile picture to a “gay bill board for AIDS” and using the term “no homo” to frequently remind us of his superior heterosexuality. If he’s even made to comment on any of this, I imagine he will use his youth as an excuse but the tweets in question were sent in his early 30s, quite clearly old enough to know the difference between right and bigoted.Hart’s obsession with making unfunny, disrespectful and inappropriate jokes about a community he has shown nothing but bile for along with a string of unrepentant responses to any criticism paints him as someone entirely undeserving of a spot on the Oscars stage. If the Academy wants to progress and remain relevant, handpicking a man with a history of homophobia is a flashing red siren of an issue, a middle finger up to the LGBT community and a sign that Oscars might no longer be quite as white but they remain aggressively straight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa2db60051abdd3b19120ccaabafca9096d5a3a7/427_0_3077_1847/master/3077.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7225a870e0be50646c3901fdd2779c1f","title":"tom cruise motion smoothing interpolation","story":"It’s over. Now Tom Cruise has set his sights on ‘motion smoothing’ – the TV effect that makes films look like soap operas – it’s only a matter of time before you tweak the settingsThis has been a landmark year for Tom Cruise. In Mission: Impossible – Fallout he made the action film of his career. He’s currently filming a sequel to one of his most beloved films, Top Gun. And it’s been rumoured that he has plans to make history by literally filming Mission: Impossible 7 in space.How on earth could Tom Cruise manage to top all this? Simple. He’s made a video urging you to switch off motion smoothing on your TV. For this, he deserves everything. Welcome back, Tom. We’ve missed you.At 9:46 last night, Tom tweeted an 87-second video in which he and his go-to director Christopher McQuarrie explained the concept of video interpolation and why it is the death of all good things. Video interpolation, they explained, is a digital video effect used to improve the quality of high-definition sport. “The unfortunate effect is that it makes most movies look like they were shot on high-speed video rather than film,” said Cruise. “This is sometimes referred to as the ‘soap-opera effect’.” They explained that most HD televisions come with video interpolation switched on by default, they explained how to switch it off, and then they both nodded with total sincerity.Now, it’s worth noting that Tom Cruise is by no means the first film-maker to rail against motion smoothing. Back when he was still the s of the Galaxy director, James Gunn tweeted that he, Edgar Wright, Rian Johnson and Matt Reeves were also peeved about the default nature of video interpolation, to which Reed Morano replied that she started a petition to fix the issue a number of years ago, to little avail.Why did it fail? Possibly because none of these people are Tom Cruise. Because Tom Cruise has made a career of total commitment. Take him to a premiere and he’ll spend hours on the red carpet, shaking every single hand until everyone’s happy. Put him in a movie with helicopters in it and he’ll teach himself to fly a helicopter to the level of a veteran stunt coordinator. Break his ankle on the side of a building, and he’ll stagger out of frame on his ruined legs rather than blow a shot.So you’d better believe that, if Tom Cruise wants you to turn off motion smoothing on your television, you will turn off motion smoothing on your television. This video is just the start. The next stage will be visiting your house personally and asking you nicely. After that he’ll visit your house and verbally threaten you. If you still haven’t switched off motion smoothing by then, Tom Cruise will force himself through your TV screen using willpower alone, like the girl from The Ring, grab the remote out of your dumb cow hands and turn off motion smoothing himself. He will do whatever it takes.The thing is, he has a point. Video smoothing is the worst. It’s too sharp and too cheap-looking, and undoes all the millions of dollars that go into making a film look nice. My younger brother Pete has a TV the size of his living-room wall, and he still hasn’t switched off motion smoothing. He invited me around his house not so long ago, to watch the Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson film San Andreas. And it was legitimately unwatchable. With video interpolation turned on, the whole film looked awful, like a kaleidoscope made of different types of migraine. Tom Cruise is doing a good thing here. He deserves our respect.Plus, you know, it’s just nice to see a Tom Cruise video appear online that isn’t somehow about Xenu. If nothing else, that has to count for something."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f01f4bb5820b31f018a270a70901d7ec4661344/389_3512_6734_4040/master/6734.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a31708e7c309acffd971e3af237f012","title":"gingerbread biscuits decorations recipe felicity cloake","story":"Gingerbread men are always a festive treat, for the tree and tummy alike, but why not mix things up this Christmas with stars, trees – or even a dinosaur?Forget glittery aubergines and hand-tied wreaths: the best decoration is an edible decoration, preferably homemade. Sweetly spiced gingerbread of the crunchy nut variety, rather than the sticky cake or crumbly Cumbrian kind, is the ideal material for stars and trees – or even the odd festive dinosaur.

Add the sugar and beat again until there are no lumps and the mixture is well combined – you can use a wooden spoon for this if you’re feeling strong, or the beating tool on a food mixer, which will be quicker and easier.Break the egg into a cup or jug and beat with a fork to mix the yolk and white. Very gradually beat the egg into the butter and sugar mixture, a little at a time so it doesn’t curdle. If it does start to look grainy, don’t worry – just add a little flour to bring it back together.Put the flour, baking powder, salt and spices in a separate bowl and whisk to mix and help break up any lumps. Now stir them into the butter and sugar until the mixture comes together into a dough. Stir the finely chopped crystallised ginger or dried apricots into the dough as well.Spread a large rectangle of clingfilm on a work surface and put the gingerbread dough on top. Cover it with another large rectangle of clingfilm, then gently roll out with a rolling pin until the dough is about 3mm thick. Transfer to a baking sheet or chopping board, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, heat the oven to 190C (180C fan)390Fgas 6 and lightly grease two baking sheets. Remove the top layer of clingfilm, cut out the biscuits using cookie cutters of whatever shape you like, then arrange on the baking sheets, leaving a couple of centimetres between each one, so they have room to spread out while they bake.Bake for 10 minutes. Make sure you have a skewer or cocktail stick ready and, as soon as you take the biscuits out of the oven, poke holes big enough to thread a ribbon through in the top – it’s important to do this when the biscuits are still warm, because if you wait until they cool, they will break.Very gently transfer the biscuits to a wire rack (they will still be soft, but don’t worry – they’ll crisp up as they cool) and leave to cool completely before you begin to ice them. If you put the icing on when they’re too warm, it will just run off.If you want to ice the biscuits, sift the icing sugar into a wide bowl to get rid of any lumps. Stir in just enough boiling water to make a smooth paste, then dip one face of each biscuit in the icing. Sprinkle with hundreds and thousands, if using, then put back on the rack to set.Alternatively, decorate the biscuits with writing icing or melt some chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of boiling water (or in the microwave) and drizzle over the cooled biscuits. Poke through the holes again if they become clogged with icing, then thread through a ribbon or a piece of string, to hang up the biscuits with."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85e4dc29999f5798221f4fafa673f3f8ee679092/0_72_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77fb6f722c0d5a8059b9f2def95f3f13","title":"burnley liverpool premier league match report","story":"Liverpool kept up their unbeaten record to maintain the pressure on Manchester City by coming from behind to beat Burnley. When the home side took a second-half lead it briefly looked as though they might climb out of the bottom three and leave Liverpool five points adrift of the league leaders but two goals in quick succession from James Milner and Roberto Firmino rescued the situation for the visitors.Mohamed Salah missed a couple of chances to make the game safe that he would have buried last season but still had a hand in the decisive third goal, flicking an instinctive pass for Xherdan Shaqiri to score with an emphatic first-time finish. The Switzerland international was unmarked in the box, mainly because most Burnley defenders were returning from attempting to equalise at a corner, with Alisson touching a Ben Mee header on to his post before the ball was cleared downfield. That is the sort of luck Burnley are enduring at the moment whereas fortune seems to be favouring Liverpool, whose fans enjoyed putting Divock Origi’s name into their seasonal ditty: Merry Christmas Everton.Jürgen Klopp gave the Belgian a rare start after his last-minute heroics in the Merseyside derby, one of seven changes to the side. That seemed a lot, even allowing for Sadio Mané’s foot injury, though the Liverpool manager said it was par for the course for the busiest stage of the season. Playing at right-back, Joe Gomez needed treatment after hitting a perimeter fence when Mee halted his run down the wing, eventually departing midway through the first half to cut short Trent Alexander-Arnold’s evening of rest. “Joe is injured,” Klopp said. “The tackle might have been fair but you have to be careful on such a wet pitch.”The first period was short on goalmouth action, or indeed attacking moves of any promise. Liverpool lacked penetration and any element of surprise without their usual front three, while the home side were always likeliest to score from a set piece. Cruelly, when Ashley Barnes had applied a perfect finish to a well-flighted free-kick from Robbie Brady at the end of the first half, his celebrations were cut short by a flag for a narrow offside. Alisson in the Liverpool goal, helpless as Barnes’ volley flew past him into the net, was possibly the most relieved man in the ground.Joe Hart was called into action early in the second half when Naby Keïta struck a fierce shot from the edge of the area, one that was heading for the top corner before the goalkeeper made a one-handed save. At that point Liverpool looked to be getting on top, so it was a surprise when Burnley took the lead just before the hour. James Tarkowski’s weak header from a corner would have been a routine save for Alisson but for Chris Wood’s touch. The goalkeeper could only parry and, when he tried to reclaim the ball, Barnes got his foot in first, allowing Jack Cork to score from the ricochet. It was the scrappiest of goals and Liverpool complained bitterly that the goalkeeper had been impeded – but Stuart Attwell, after checking with his assistant, came to the conclusion that no foul had been committed.Klopp’s response was to warm up Salah and Firmino, but before they could be introduced Liverpool were level. Keïta found some space on the left, Origi coolly played a ball back out of the area and Milner took a brief look up before clipping a low shot just inside Hart’s left-hand upright from the edge of the area.Salah and Firmino did then come on and the latter had a goal with his first touch from what looked like a training-ground move. A short free-kick resulted in Alexander-Arnold crossing to the far post, where Virgil van Dijk reached it with his foot and turned the ball across the face of goal, leaving the Brazilian the simplest of tap-ins.Now more recognisable and with Salah’s presence dissuading Burnley from throwing too many men forward, Liverpool were comfortable even before adding a third, though Sean Dyche was entitled to bemoan his side’s luck."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e5e995505fe13cb6ebea73a059d16987edac811/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb746d9784f97744192bbc4a0421ca78","title":"manchester united arsenal premier league match report","story":"By the time it was all done the supporters of these famous old clubs could be forgiven for pining for the days when this was the most eagerly anticipated fixture in the Premier League. It was an error-strewn match, high on incident but low on quality, and Arsenal in particular will realise it could have been a more profitable night if they had removed some of the carelessness. Twice they led but on each occasion they were swiftly pegged back by a Manchester United side that have huffed and puffed to only three points from their last four games.If nothing else, United’s powers of recovery at least indicate that the league’s eighth-placed team cannot be accused of lacking fight – not on this occasion anyway. Ultimately, though, the goals from Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard will not disperse the feeling that something is obviously wrong with the 20-times champions. Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku could not even make the starting line-up and United were fortunate, perhaps, that Arsenal were unable to defend with more substance on the two occasions the visitors had put themselves in a position of strength.The final goal of a dishevelled, rain-soaked evening was a case in point. It came within 13 seconds of the restart, Arsenal having gone 2-1 ahead courtesy of the substitute Alexandre Lacazette, and was fashioned via nothing more refined than a long punt from Marcos Rojo, a heavy touch from Sead Kolasinac inside his own penalty area and Lingard nipping in to poke a scruffy yet important goal past Bernd Leno, Arsenal’s slow-to-react goalkeeper.Then again Lacazette’s goal was hardly a masterpiece. This time Rojo lost the ball inside his own half. Lacazette exchanged passes with Henrikh Mkhitaryan, another substitute, and Rojo’s attempts to save himself resulted in a sliding tackle that succeeded only in nudging the ball past David de Gea. It was credited as an own goal, though replays showed the final touch came off Lacazette’s instep, completely by fluke.As United-Arsenal games go, it was certainly difficult to remember another contest featuring so many of what Tony Adams, in his television role, described as “schoolboy errors”. This was the first time in 32 years, encompassing 83 meetings, that this fixture has taken place without Sir Alex Ferguson or Arsène Wenger in one of the dugouts. It was eighth against fourth at the start of play (Arsenal have now dropped back to fifth) and in United’s case it probably sums up their malaise that a club that once fielded, from right to left, David Beckham, Roy Keane, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs as their midfield quartet started with a wing-back system featuring Diogo Dalot, Ander Herrera, Nemanja Matic and Matteo Darmian across the middle. Fred, the £52m forgotten man, was not even among the substitutes and Arsenal were denied only by De Gea’s goalkeeping in the final 20 minutes, when he saved from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, twice, and Lucas Torreira. Incredibly it was the first time any goalkeeper has kept out a shot from Aubameyang in a league match since Lukasz Fabianski managed it for West Ham in August.Equally Mourinho must also be concerned that De Gea, usually such a brilliantly consistent goalkeeper, is having an erratic season. United’s goalkeeper will certainly not wish to see the replays of the opening goal, 26 minutes in, when Torreira swung over a corner from the left and Shkodran Mustafi powered in with a downward header. Bouncing off the turf, the ball flicked off De Gea’s gloves and dropped behind him rather than, as he intended, going over the crossbar. Herrera might still have saved United by trying to head the ball away, rather than waiting for it to drop and kicking clear, but it was poor goalkeeping. Mourinho later remarked that his team “drew 2-2 but we scored four goals”.Arsenal held the lead for only four minutes, continuing their run of having not led a league game at half-time this season, but they can be aggrieved about the free-kick that led to the goal and, secondly, that the linesman did not see that Herrera was marginally offside when Rojo took aim. Leno saved the shot but Herrera was fast to the rebound. His cutback went behind Lingard but rolled invitingly to Martial and, with nobody in an Arsenal shirt reacting quickly enough, he turned in his eighth goal of the season.Arsenal, now 20 games unbeaten in all competitions, lost Rob Holding to a first-half injury and Aaron Ramsey, with a twisted ankle, was unable to come back out for the second half. That meant Mkhitaryan entering the game on a night when Mesut Özil was absent again from Unai Emery’s team, and the former United player was unfortunate that a linesman’s flag denied him a late winner. It was the correct decision but the angled, left-foot volley from Mkhitaryan was exquisite, one of the few moments of high quality from a game that felt a long way removed from United versus Arsenal in the good old days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c28ba4fef3f83b6e870bc484c7ca02ec909f31e9/0_250_4860_2916/master/4860.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dff000b6f4a4a2343f505b5cc3671a4","title":"tottenham southampton premier league match report","story":"It was tempting to say that Ralph Hasenhüttl now knows the scale of the challenge that faces him at Southampton but the truth is the new manager was already painfully aware. Relegation-threatened clubs are queasily placed for good reason. They call for fresh direction in the middle of a season because they are desperate.There were familiar flaws for Hasenhüttl to digest from his seat in the Wembley stands, having been confirmed as Mark Hughes’s successor in the morning – namely, defensive looseness that added up to the softest of concessions and, at the other end, a lack of discernible goal threat until Tottenham were 3-0 up and the game was over.Time, of course, is short for Hasenhüttl. His first match comes at Cardiff on Saturday and the club will pray for a new-manager bounce. His presence did not inspire one here, although Southampton – under the caretaker charge of Kelvin Davis – did enjoy a decent final half-hour, when Hugo Lloris was forced into a succession of saves. To repeat: the game was over by then.Mauricio Pochettino described Lloris as the man of the match, which was strange, but it was a strange kind of occasion, played out in front of only 33,012 – comfortably Spurs’ lowest attendance for a Premier League game at Wembley. Their regular followers are sick of playing here.Tottenham were able to bounce back from their 4-2 defeat at Arsenal on Sunday, with Harry Kane putting them in charge with his 13th goal of the club season and Lucas Moura and the excellent Son Heung-min giving the scoreline its gloss.Davis could be proud of how his players kept going, with Lloris making his saves and the substitute, Mohamed Elyounoussi, heading against the crossbar in stoppage-time before another replacement, Charlie Austin, ran through to score. But no team can defend this generously and expect to emerge unscathed.“I think it’s a mindset,” Davis said. “I don’t know whether it’s confidence. If you look at the goals we conceded, they’re ultimately easy to stop. It’s something the new manager will be looking to address as quickly as he can.”Spurs switched off at 3-0 but the biggest blot on their evening was the groin injury that forced off Kieran Trippier. He was replaced by the 18-year-old Oliver Skipp, for whom it was a Premier League debut.Pochettino said that Trippier’s problem was a legacy of the one he suffered for England in the World Cup semi-final against Croatia. He felt the suspect Wembley surface had done the full-back no favours.Hasenhüttl had flown into London and he addressed the club’s staff at the team hotel but he kept his distance from the players, paying Davis the respect of not interfering with his preparations. Davis has been named as his assistant coach.“He was very concise with his information and he explained how he wants to work,” Davis said. “There was a good feel to him. It was quite simple – how he likes to play the game, how he likes his sessions to be planned, how he watches opposition, what he expects in terms of standards.”Southampton made a false start. After Son had stuck the post with a volley, the visitors’ defence switched off on a Spurs corner. Trippier played it short to Christian Eriksen, he crossed and nobody tracked the run of Kane.Southampton stabilised and they would have been level midway through the first half but Pierre-Emile Højbjerg’s fizzing drive from 25 yards hit the inside of the post and Stuart Armstrong was offside on the rebound. It looked as though Lloris had got his fingertips to the shot. Southampton had some good spells of possession but cutting edge is what they wanted.Spurs looked as though they would score more before half-time, with Alex McCarthy making one particularly smart save to deny Son, and they did score more after the interval. Steven Davis failed to clear Trippier’s corner and Lucas lashed home at the second attempt. The third came when Trippier won the ball from Matt Targett Kane crossed and Son tapped home.Cue the Southampton flurry. Maya Yoshida somehow failed to touch home James Ward-Prowse’s free-kick, Lloris made a double save to deny Højbjerg and Ward-Prowse while he also thwarted Austin. The striker would find a way through with virtually the last kick but, by then, Southampton’s thoughts were turning to Cardiff."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d06c408117f757e75418988442c9352dabbcf4dd/0_289_6028_3618/master/6028.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=613075a62b7051bdd5de0772e8ff1784","title":"wolves chelsea premier league match report","story":"After claiming on the eve of this game that Chelsea are “not able to fight with Manchester City” for the title Maurizio Sarri was proved absolutely right. Pep Guardiola’s side visit Stamford Bridge on Saturday with the gap between the two clubs now standing at 10 points after Chelsea fell to a second successive defeat that highlighted how much work Sarri has to do to turn Chelsea into credible challengers.Ahead through Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s early goal, Chelsea had the perfect platform to go on and win the game but badly lost their way against a Wolves side who played with the courage, belief and flair that has been badly missing in recent weeks. The turning point was Raúl Jiménez’s equaliser, just before the hour mark, and from that moment on Chelsea never recovered. “We were suddenly another team,” Sarri said.A couple of potentially critical refereeing decisions went against Chelsea – Álvaro Morata had strong claims for a penalty turned down and Willian felt he was fouled in the lead-up to Wolves’ second goal – but Sarri was too disappointed with the way his players performed in the final 30 minutes to dwell on either incident.The Italian, who made five changes to his starting lineup – Loftus-Cheek, Andreas Christensen and Cesc Fàbregas all made their first Premier League starts of the season – questioned his players’ mentality and attitude at the end of a chastening evening. He also suggested that some members of his team have “too much confidence”.For Wolves, who came into the game on the back of a miserable run of form in which they collected only one point from a possible 18, this felt like a restorative victory. They were unrecognisable from the team that lost meekly to Huddersfield and Cardiff in their previous two matches and it turned into a special evening for one teenager in particular.Morgan Gibbs-White, aged 18, was outstanding on his full Premier League debut. Showing some lovely touches, the attacking midfielder played with a maturity beyond his years. It was his perfectly weighted pass that set up Jiménez for the equaliser and he thoroughly deserved the standing ovation that followed when he was substituted 20 minutes from time. “I think he is one of the best generation of England players for a long time,” said Nuno Espírito Santo.The sight of Diogo Jota, who was Wolves’ top scorer last season, wheeling away in delight after converting Matt Doherty’s lovely cross completed a perfect evening for the Midlands club. Jota has not looked quite the same player this season but his first Premier League goal of the campaign should give him a huge lift, with the relief almost tangible as he celebrated in front of the euphoric Wolves supporters.The visitors’ opening goal owed much to good fortune. Loftus-Cheek picked up possession on the left from Eden Hazard and hit a curling right-foot shot that was unlikely to trouble Rui Patrício much until Conor Coady got in the way. Stooping to try to block the ball, the Wolves defender succeeded only in heading it beyond his own keeper and inside the near post. The goal was still credited to Loftus-Cheek, who has now scored six times in his last seven club appearances.Patrício produced an excellent save to tip Willian’s free-kick on to the bar and over and the Brazilian was denied again later in the first half when Ryan Bennett made a superbly timed tackle. Yet Wolves also signalled their intent during that opening period, especially down the left flank , where Rúben Vinagre delivered some dangerous crosses. Jiménez headed one over the bar and another ended up at the feet of Gibbs-White only for Fàbregas, who came into the Chelsea team for Jorginho, to make a crucial last-ditch tackle.Then came that penalty appeal straight after the restart, when Willy Boly appeared to swipe Morata’s feet from under him as he tried to touch in an inviting Loftus-Cheek cross. The significance of that moment became clear little more than 10 minutes later, when Jiménez ran on to Gibbs-White’s pass and drilled a low shot that seemed almost to go through Kepa Arrizabalaga in the Chelsea goal.In the blink of an eye Wolves had a second after João Moutinho dispossessed Willian deep inside the Chelsea half before releasing Doherty on the right. Jota dispatched the Irishman’s cross and Wolves were in dreamland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a6b78a12ce81265d1cc5a6705a2e5ce5ba8674e/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc69c0fe306f6eff94d02a7e62e30a0e","title":"the 100 best female footballers in the world 2018","story":"Here are Nos 100 to 41 on the ’s list of best female players in the world.

With more than 200 million players worldwide, the game makes around $300m a month for its developer, most of that from in-game purchases of skins and emotes.Set to be available from the main Fortnite menu in addition to the current modes, Save the World and Battle Royale, Creative gives players a choice of island shapes, before giving them access to their own private landscape using a simple drag and drop interface, they can populate the landscape with a variety of pre-made buildings and scenic objects. It’s then possible to set up a range of mini-games, such as deathmatch shoot-outs and obstacle courses, to play with friends who have been invited on to the player’s server.Player-made worlds can be saved to memory and shared with friends. A hub at the outset will also provide access to selected worlds built by other members of the community.The mode provides an extension to the popular Battle Royale Playground option, which allowed players to land on an island with friends and mess about, making their own objectives. It is similar to the creative mode in the block-building game Minecraft, in which players can similarly create their own buildings and landscapes without worrying about being attacked. It may well answer criticism from some parents that Fortnite concentrates too heavily on killing other players.For the first week, only those players who purchase a Season Seven Battlepass will have access to the new mode from 13 December, it will be free for all.Since the launch of Fortnite Battle Royale in September 2017, developer Epic Games has regularly updated the game, adding new modes and scenic features for every three-month “season”. Creative mode is the biggest change in the past year, and is likely to be highly popular with the game’s vast YouTuber and Twitch streamer community."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9512f4dfc1ad4205735a77b98ca2a9e8f7d10f20/0_136_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efc2bd1b735b13a3a5aae9500e244616","title":"how to introduce your tweenager to online safety","story":"Parents are understandably anxious about discussing complex issues such as online bullying, screen time and the power of social media, but it’s a chat that can’t – and shouldn’t – be avoidedDiscussing the complications of being online is up there with the truth about Father Christmas and the birds and the bees on the list of conversations parents least look forward to having with their children, but it’s one that can’t be avoided.The tweenage years (10-12) are a time when children naturally begin to take more risks. This bravado is vital to their development. Combine it with a smartphone that gives instant access to a world of games and all sorts of video content, however, and you have a potentially tricky cocktail.“The internet is an amazing place and a wonderful resource, but, like all things, it has its dark side and its dangers,” says children’s commissioner Anne Longfield. “Parents have a vital role to play in making children aware of how to handle the challenges of being online.”Parents are understandably anxious and reticent about discussing some of these issues, but learning and behaviour specialist Noël Janis-Norton, who also founded calmerparenting, is adamant they should tackle the subjects early. “Don’t wait until something goes wrong,” she says. “The conversation needs to start before tweenagers even have a phone, so clear rules can be put in place.”It’s not a chat to be had on the fly either. “The more serious you can make the conversation feel, the more likely children will take it seriously,” she advises. “If there are two parents involved, both should sit down together, to make the message feel united.”Taking the issues seriously is one thing, but it’s important not to let the conversation become emotional or dramatic. “As adults we can really set the tone,” says chartered educational psychologist Dan O’Hare. “Do you want a child to learn that when they talk about subjects like this they make Mum or Dad scared and angry, or do you want them to learn that you can talk about difficult things together?”Dictating a list of how much screen time is allowed, or which apps are out-of-bounds, won’t work either. Instead, work together to agree a set of suitable guidelines or a contract – your children will be much more likely to stick to these rules. “Parents can learn a lot about the internet from their children, so it needn’t be a lecture or a telling off, but an exploration together,” says Longfield.It’s a view endorsed by O’Hare, who recommends that parents draw on the tricky online situations they’ve experienced personally. “If an adult talks about an upsetting post they’ve seen on Facebook they can then involve the child in discussing ways to deal with it. That collaborative coming together gives the young person a sense of responsibility.”How can parents know whether their messages and advice are truly getting through to their children? Janis-Norton recommends “think-throughs”, where a parent spends just a minute at a time encouraging a child to consider a situation and how they would respond to it. “Ask something like: ‘What can you tell a stranger online?’ or ‘How can you tell if somebody online is really a kid?’ to get your child thinking about things properly. Their brain will automatically start visualising what they should do, so it sticks in their mind much better.”Having set these guidelines, it’s vital that parents praise their children when they abide by them, such as by turning off their phones at mealtimes. “Parents can be so preoccupied that they don’t say anything when things are going well, and only notice when something’s going wrong,” says Janis-Norton. “Praise helps a child associate following the rules with their parents being pleased and there being a relaxed, happy atmosphere at home.”There’s a growing amount of practical tools that can help. The monqi phone management app creates a closed and entirely safe ecosystem that makes it easy for kids to get started online, using a handset such as the IMO S2 the app also enables parents to monitor what their children are up to online via their own phone, and set screen time limits. Then there’s the phone behaviour contract for families, created by tech expert Andy Robertson, and Childline’s Zipit app, which gives kids the tools to deflect unwanted online attention – with the help of downloadable gifs.Parents can take an active practical role here too. “It’s all very well telling a child to block someone on Instagram or report them on Facebook, but they need to know how to actually do it,” says O’Hare. “As adults we have a responsibility to learn how to do these things ourselves, so we can teach the children.”Of course, the discussion about online safety doesn’t end there. New tech, new trends and even new friends all bring fresh challenges that will need to be talked about and agreed upon. But by establishing open, relaxed ways of communicating about tricky issues, parents can keep healthy conversations going throughout childhood, into adolescence and beyond.Visit Tesco Mobile to find out more about the IMO S2 with monqi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/841058cc8cd9af17a6167a3023c35614392e20a0/0_2_1960_1176/master/1960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=890f10052caff9c4a2ae349b6c2a5d86","title":"legal analytics when big data meets big law","story":"Automated data analysis has changed how scientists think about health research, and is helping uncover inefficiencies in transport systems. Now it’s making waves in the legal sectorData is invading the legal system. In January, prosecutors in Germany presented a court with data from an iPhone suggesting a suspect was climbing stairs when it was alleged he had been dragging a body down a steep bank. It isn’t the only case of its kind: pacemaker data has been used in US courts as evidence against a wearer and data from fitness trackers has been used to indicate how, for example, a person’s lifestyle has changed after an injury.The amount of data being created by the devices people carry around has grown exponentially, and had a knock-on impact across multiple professions. For criminal lawyers, it has increased the potential evidence that’s available, and this increase in data has been mirrored across all branches of law. It’s a trend that has the potential to completely disrupt the legal profession. “The biggest impact,” says James Rogers, a solicitor at Norton Rose Fulbright, “will not be caused by big data alone – rather it will be the combination of big data with other innovations, such as artificial intelligence (AI) or distributed ledger technologies.”Data created through the legal process is already being digitised and combined with other tech. It has the potential to make the jobs of lawyers more straightforward. “We will be able to find pertinent cases more easily through better recommender systems that leverage machine learning,” says Wolfgang Alschner, an assistant professor in common law at the University of Ottawa. “Another area is document and compliance review, where computers can find patterns in large amounts of texts more reliably and quickly.”Everlaw, a legal tech startup that has raised more than $25m from Silicon Valley investors, is applying AI to historic legal reports to help lawyers prioritise and analyse documents. It is using computer science to visualise data from documents and predict the most relevant cases for lawyers to inspect.For such a system to analyse court cases and predict decisions, it needs data. But this has to be the right type of data. It needs to be easily read and understood by machines – scruffy handwriting can be tough to interpret, but clear check boxes on forms are easier for software to understand. If big data is machine readable, then AI systems can save the legal industry money and time.Rogers says it will initially have the greatest impact on areas that are “relatively formulaic and process- or volume-driven”. This includes disclosure, verification, first-tier due diligence review and similar processes. However, AI won’t be using data to formulate complex adversarial arguments at any point soon. “Human elements: intuition, judgment, emotion, memory, perception and so on, are all integral to that process,” he says.It’s already been proven that data can be put to work to speed up lengthy legal processes. In one instance, the UK’s Serious Fraud Office found itself with more than 30m documents to examine during a corruption investigation into Rolls-Royce.“The program was able to interpret and understand material from a range of sources, including emails, financial records, data tables and photographs – but, unlike a human team, it could work efficiently for days on end without interruption,” he says. The SFO won the case – its biggest investigation – and Rolls-Royce was ordered by a court to pay £497m, plus the costs of the SFO’s investigation.For the moment, AI and analytical platforms create an advantage for legal firms and clients that can afford to pay for it. But it also has the potential to democratise the sector. “It will make legal services more accessible to lay people by driving down costs and by fuelling the development of self-help applications directly targeted at non-lawyers,” Alschner says. “All this will transform the role of the lawyer and their day-to-day legal practice.”Stanford law student Joshua Browder has been pivotal in improving how legal data can be combined with technology to make the law easier to comprehend. He created a chat-bot “lawyer,” called DoNotPay, which allows users to contest parking tickets they have received. Browder says the system talks people through the legal steps required to make a complaint and automatically files their issue. It has won more than 400,000 cases. The DoNotPay system has since been expanded to tackle legal loopholes used when flights are booked, to help customers get automatic refunds.But there are some concerns around the use of big data. Data scientists, across multiple fields, have shown that automated systems inherit any bias that’s contained in the data they are trained upon. In some cases, AI has replicated racist and sexist language it has seen in data sets. Alschner argues that legal data needs to be freely accessible, while also ensuring that privacy laws are respected.“Law is a public good,” he says. “But most legal texts, from court decisions to filings, are only accessible through commercial service providers that do not generally share data in bulk.” The solution to the problem? “Large legal information providers can lead the way by sharing more of their data with academics, governments and legal analytics companies,” Alschner adds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bb1d4e5d4c1593500106dba8b5d92c7a7041a21/0_142_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf43985a7fb660a8da53beb4032351b0","title":"community space council landlord kick us out","story":"In this series Poppy Noor discusses an issue concerning how we can build happy, well-run communities. But what do you think? Send us your thoughts and responsesWe run a community space and are being asked to leave by our landlord. Our hub has been home to many important charities and social enterprises, providing everything from community dance classes to communal lunches. But the space is lucrative and our landlord wants to redevelop it. In law it feels like there’s not a lot we can do – the landlord owns the property and despite us agreeing to all the rent hikes that have  been imposed, doesn’t want us to stay. We have fostered community relationships here and provided spaces and businesses that people benefit from (which we think  has contributed to the popularity of the area). As council services are cut back and funding to vital social services all over the city dwindles, social enterprises like ours are filling a really vital role in providing some of these services. We know the council  recognises this, too, and when we organised a big march it was very supportive.It just doesn’t feel right to kick us out. This is happening all over the country –  useful resources that are important to the community being forced out in order to turn a big profit there’s no support for the little guys. We are on the brink of being forced out, but think the role of the council should be to protect these facilities. Is there anything more we can  do to make it help?As you will know, this is a legal dispute that requires specialist knowledge, and for that you will need a lawyer who deals with landlord and tenant law. If there is anything untoward happening in this process, they will be the ones who can help you out.The council has been an ally. It has rejected development proposals that would turn the space into flats, so it sounds like it cares about what becomes of the building. But it doesn’t own the property, so its reach is pretty limited: this isn’t a classic case of a council shutting down a library it owns, or knocking down some flats.Still, exerting pressure can encourage a council to do the best it can: you saw this when you organised the march. There are tools that can be used, such as compulsory purchase orders, which allow the council to take the land over (or at least scare a landlord into using it in a certain way), but these are burdensome and costly, and have a very high bar for justification. Beyond just being a community benefit, for example, you would have to show there is no other way to deliver the service without the compulsory purchase. I’m not saying it’s impossible, but the council would really need to see the benefits of getting involved any more than it already is.Your other option is to turn the property into an asset of community value – which would also be decided by the council. This gives you six months to make the case for why the landlord should let you run the property, rather than it being repurposed.In the longer term, it’s a question about what you want your neighbourhood to look like, and it is the council that has control over this. “There will always be more lucrative uses of land. It’s hard to imagine a space that wouldn’t be more lucrative as a flat,” says public and environmental lawyer Sarah Sackman. The reason that doesn’t happen, she points out, is pretty much down to planning policy. Property law favours the owner, but planning policy is a hugely important tool for shaping communities. Sackman has worked on cases where spaces that make good neighbourhoods but don’t have obvious public benefit have been protected by the council: “It’s about having a hand in what you want your town to look like. And it’s probably the most powerful and imaginative lever you have.”• What do you think? Or have you got a question for Poppy and readers to consider?

Raynor talks about that time and the Costa-nominated memoir their experience inspiredOn a Thursday afternoon in August 2013, Raynor Winn and her husband, Moth, set off from Minehead in Somerset to walk the 630-mile South West Coast Path. She was 50, he was 53. They had a tent bought on eBay, a couple of cheap, thin sleeping bags, £115 in cash and a bankcard with which to draw out the £48 a week they were due in tax credits. They were broke and broken.Through a combination of bad decisions and bad luck – a friend who turned out not to be a friend, and a toxic investment – they had lost the farmhouse that was their home and their source of income – renting to holidaymakers. It was also the place where their children had grown up and to which they returned during university holidays.When the bailiffs came banging on the door, it seemed things could not get worse. But the bombshells didn’t stop. Around the same time, Moth was diagnosed with a rare degenerative brain disease, CBD. The specialist told him that death usually comes six to eight years after the onset – and that he had probably had it for about six years. “You can’t be ill, I still love you,” Raynor told the man with whom she had been since sixth-form college.The idea of walking the coast path came to Raynor when she spotted a book she had read in her 20s in one of their packing cases. Five Hundred Mile Walkies was written by a man who had done the South West Coast Path with his dog. The walk gave Moth and Raynor some sense of purpose, and, she says: “We really didn’t have anything better to do.”Their journey – which they split over two summers, wintering in a friend’s shed – ended a year later, in Polruan, Cornwall, with an offer from a kind stranger of accommodation – a flat at the back of an old chapel. That is where I have come today, over on the little ferry from Fowey, bearing well-wrapped fish and chips.Moth is not here – he has gone for a walk. He is not as well as he was when they finished the big trek in summer 2014 (walking all day, with a big pack, kept his physical and mental deterioration at arm’s length), but he is still here, and still walking. He can have his fish and chips later, heated up, says Raynor. There is a microwave, plus a cooker, fridge, washing machine, pictures on the walls … and a kettle. She makes tea. On the coast path, they scrounged hot water and shared teabags. On a few indulgent occasions, they shared a bag of chips.Raynor wrote an article about their walk for the Big Issue, and then wrote a book for herself, but mainly for Moth. It was a gift to him: a big fat love letter, and maybe a reminder for when his memory began to fade. Their daughter read it and said her mum should try to do something with it. They began by Googling literary agents and ended by meeting Penguin. (When Raynor was little, growing up on a Staffordshire farm, it had been her dream to be a writer and have penguins on the spines of her books.) Now, The Salt Path – Raynor’s beautiful, thoughtful, lyrical story of homelessness, human strength and endurance, has been shortlisted for the Costa book award.Homelessness isn’t something Raynor had thought much about before it happened to her. If she saw someone in a doorway, she might have given them 50p, but never dreamed she would end up like that. “I thought I had more control,” she says, between mouthfuls of fish and chips.People in urban doorways, probably with addictions andor mental health problems is the general perception of homelessness. But it is not the whole picture, she says. “People in rural environments keep themselves hidden,” she explains. They could be in work, “but because their jobs are temporary, or seasonal, or very low waged, or zero hours – a vast array of reasons – they aren’t acceptable to landlords. And where do you go?”You sofa-surf, or you live in the woods, or in someone’s horsebox. Or, in the case of Raynor and Moth, every night you wild-camp in a different place on the South West Coast Path. With preconceptions come prejudice, that homeless people are to be a bit afraid of and disapproved of. Raynor and Moth experienced that. “When you’re passing people on the path, inevitably you exchange a few words: where have you come from are you going far? When we said we were going a long way, people would say: how come you’ve got so much time to walk so far? Initially, we’d say it’s because we were homeless, we had nowhere to go. And they would physically recoil, draw the dog in on a retractable lead, gather the children.”Early on in their journey, Raynor dropped some of the few coins they had left outside a shop. She was on the ground trying to get them out of a drain when a woman with a dog started “poking me with her foot, saying: ‘Get up, you drunken tramp, we don’t want people like you here.’ I was thinking: Who’s she talking to? Then I realised she was talking to me. And I think that was the point where my sense of self fell apart, the sense of who I was. From that point, it’s very easy to give up, to look for ways to get away from that feeling.”She thinks that loss of sense of self “is the fundamental, biggest issue about becoming homeless. That sense of who you are and how you identify yourself, once you’ve lost that, it’s a long way to climb back, to rebuild.”How did she manage not to lose that completely? “I think because we were walking. And because we were together.” They developed strategies when people asked how they had time to walk so far, they would say they had sold their house and were just going where the wind blows, having a midlife moment. “And people would be like: ‘Oh, wow, fantastic, inspirational!’ That huge difference in attitude between you sold your house and you lost your house. It’s so so different.”As well as changing how she thought of homelessness, Raynor began to see home differently on the path. She had thought of home as the walls around her, and when she lost that, it felt as though she had lost everything. “So much of being a parent is wrapped up within the family home. In so many different ways, I had to work out how to go forwards. But, as we were walking, I started to realise that home is a state of mind, it’s what makes you feel safe – and you don’t need walls for that. You can define home in a different way, and for me that would always be my family, whether they were 100 miles away or there with a rucksack next to me.Nature plays a big part in Raynor’s book and her sense of belonging and safety. Growing up on a farm, she says, meant “being in nature was like my safe place, something I understood, and at that point I didn’t understand much at all”. There was a biblical experience with ladybirds, meaningful meetings with swallows, kestrels and a peregrine falcon, a badger, a bizarre encounter with a tortoise on a lead.When wild-camping, you are not just looking at nature, you are immersed in it, she says. “When you’re out there, day after day, night after night, you start to feel as if the natural environment has got a cohesive element of its own,” she says. “The wind affects the water, and the clouds … it’s like one big whole, and after being in it for a while I knew I was part of that big circular movement of molecules.”We have lost that connection, she says. “If we really saw that – as a people rather than iniduals – our environmental problems would start to be resolved because we would know that it wasn’t a separate thing we were causing a problem with, it’s all one thing of which we are a part.” Then she adds: “That’s a bit preachy, isn’t it?” Well, we are in an old chapel.Walking itself is important, she thinks, because it is what we were built for and meant to do. “After a while that became the reason to go on, just to put one foot in front of the other.” It took them forward in a way that staying out – camping in one place, a wood or a field – could never have done. And, miraculously, although it left them fatigued and blistered (over the 100 or so days they were walking, they climbed the equivalent of Mount Everest four times), it seemed to be good for Moth.Where they walked was important too, “a strip of wilderness, with ordinary life over to one side, and that endless horizon to the sea over to the other side, it’s like a world of its own”. And not unlike their predicament – walking a thin line between life and death.All of which sounds very gloomy. The book isn’t though, nor its writer. It is funny, sometimes uplifting. Raynor talks about how they got to Land’s End in terrible weather, horizontal rain, and had to decide whether to carry on. “There was just me and Moth on the edge of the Atlantic, with a Mars bar and a few pounds in our pocket, and two wet sheets of nylon between us and Canada. It could have been the most awful depressing moment in our lives, but it was a moment when we realised we were completely free in a way we’d never allowed ourselves to be before. In that moment, we knew that we could start to reinvent our lives in our way, how we wanted.”When the opportunity of a roof eventually arose, in Polruan, they took it, gratefully. It wasn’t always an easy transition for a couple of weeks, they had the tent up in the bedroom and slept in it. Raynor missed the natural environment, waking up to the birds and the sea, and the freedom to keep going. “There was something very strengthening about being in that environment. Coming back into ordinary life, we had to reinvent ourselves again.”It is nice to have a washing machine though, and a loo that flushes and that isn’t a gorse bush. And the path isn’t far, it runs along the lane in front of the chapel.One day last year, Raynor was walking on it again when she held open a gate for a man with a big backpack. They exchanged a few words. The usual: where had he come from, was he going far? He had set out two weeks ago from Lizard Point, the southernmost point of mainland Britain.The man didn’t look like the average backpacker. He was covered in piercings and wore a yellow high-vis workman’s jacket, his rucksack was an old fashioned one with the frame on the outside. He told her he had been sleeping on the streets of Exeter when he had read an article in the Big Issue magazine by a woman who had walked the South West Coast Path when she, too, was homeless. He had borrowed and begged a few things, and here he was.Raynor asked if he would like to come back to hers for a cup of tea, or maybe something to eat? No thanks, he said, he had to find somewhere to pitch his tent, and to carry on, because the walk had changed things he wasn’t going back to his old life.Raynor didn’t tell him that the homeless woman in the Big Issue article was her.Moth returns from his walk. Moth and Monty, a big man with a little dog. I am surprised they have a dog, because, in the book, interactions with dogs – and with their owners – are not alway good. But Monty was the runt of the litter that nobody wanted, so they took him.Moth’s diagnosis hasn’t changed: he is still terminally ill, but he continues to defy his prognosis. “Straddling the void between life and death,” is how Raynor puts it. But somehow she finds a positive. “When you live with that sort of diagnosis, that’s how it feels, but I think in doing so you appreciate life so much more,” she says. She is not talking about bucket lists or round-the-world trips, but an extra vibrancy in the ordinary when time is running out. “When the biscuit tin is empty, they taste so much better than they did when it was full.”In the book, Moth is mistaken for Simon Armitage, the poet, by people who clearly have no idea what Armitage looks like. He looks much better than I was expecting, a bit pale but with a big smile, a soft voice and a warm presence. He does feel sluggish though, and stiff. He says of his daily routine of walking and physiotherapy: “I feel like I’m constantly training for an Olympic event I’ll never compete in.” He can’t feel his feet a lot of the time. He is noticing that his memory slipping. “Don’t give me a question, or a choice of things to do,” he says. “I’m starting to feel the challenge now that I’ve been prepared for.”The memory of the big walk is still alive. The book helps to take him back there.

Garrett, a member of the board of the English National Opera, said it was “nonsense”, put forward by “backward-looking traditionalists”, to argue that “there’s an exclusive purity in the boy’s voice”.She singled out King’s College Choir, Cambridge, one of the most famous English choirs, for criticism for not introducing change, saying the choir must “wake up and listen to the music” in regards to its exclusion of girls.“I will certainly be watching the BBC’s broadcast because this is an occasion I wouldn’t miss,” she said in an interview with the Radio Times. “But I’ll also be wondering to myself this year, as I do every year: where are the girls? Girls’ voices are just as pure, just as sweet and just as sonorous.”Carols From King’s, the choir’s renowned Christmas service which is broadcast across the BBC, is celebrating its centenary this year. Based at King’s, a constituent college of the University of Cambridge, it is composed of 16 boy choristers between the ages of seven and 13. The move to accept girls would be unprecedented in the history of the choir,which was founded over half a century ago.“The irony is that King’s was the first all-male Cambridge college to admit women – which it did in 1972,” Garrett said. “It’s time they used their impressive history of gender equality and pioneering spirit to change things at their most famous set-piece event, especially in an age where gender equality is front and centre of the national debate and society’s minds.”Directly addressing the choir’s incomingdirector of music, Daniel Hyde, she added: “To set a precedent of an all-male choir does seem cruel to a girl who adores music and singing and has the purity of tone that demands she should be given a chance to win a place in a great choir like King’s. Next year, I think the new boss must act.“Carols from King’s is about tradition, but traditions must keep in step with changes in society, and in this case human rights. In this special anniversary when we celebrate 100 years of King’s Carols, we’re also marking a century of women’s suffrage. Surely, choirs that exclude girls must wake up and listen to the music.”Prof David Howard, author of the 2002 study Gendered Voice in the Cathedral Choir, said the prospect of girls singing alongside boys was “very appropriate”.“A lot of the issue is about allowing girls to have the same musical opportunity as boys in their lives. Against that is the tradition that choirs have been a boys only domain for a very long time. But is that appropriate in this day and age?“I think from an equal opportunities point of view it is something all choirs should consider. If they are not going to do it they should have a good reason as to why not.”King’s College Choir said: “We recognise the fantastic contribution that our female singers make to the choral scene here at Cambridge. We are especially proud of our mixed voice choir, King’s Voices, which was formed 20 years ago precisely to give women students opportunity to sing choral music in the chapel.“Indeed, last weekend they gave a wonderful Christmas concert of carols in the chapel which raised a significant sum of money to support local homelessness projects. They also were involved in a recording with the men and boys last week for an album to be released in the new year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bca78cea8ca062e2814c2649a51ff2998095973/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=817a81b5ee5c555c32cd8d9b7298d6d9","title":"bias in britain the truth about modern racism","story":"An exclusive  study has shown the extent of racial bias faced by minority ethnic citizens. ’s Afua Hirsch and Anushka Asthana discuss how growing up in a majority white society felt to them and whether attitudes have significantly changed since.

A government found to be in contempt of parliament for the first time in living memory. The prime minister’s desperate efforts to turn the Brexit vote into a binary choice between her deal and no deal nullified by Dominic Grieve’s amendment. If Theresa May had had worse nights, she couldn’t immediately remember them.Nor was her mood improved the following morning when she was reluctantly forced to publish the attorney general’s legal advice. Geoffrey Cox’s insistence that there wasn’t anything to see in it had turned out to be a bit of a porky. No one could remember him telling the Commons that the Northern Ireland backstop might be “indefinite” or that trade talks could end in “stalemate”. So it was a decidedly shaky looking May who entered the chamber for an hour of prime minister’s questions she could have done without.But then a stroke of luck. It turned out that the only person in the entire country to be unaware the government was on its last legs was the leader of the opposition. Let’s talk about austerity, Jeremy Corbyn began. May blinked once. Then twice. Just to check she hadn’t died and gone to heaven. But no. She was still breathing and the Labour leader really had forgotten to mention Brexit. And that she had no majority without the DUP. And that she would be lucky to last another fortnight.“We are making changes to the changes we are making,” May replied, wrong-footed by Corbyn’s amnesia and playing for time as she tried to regain her composure. The Labour leader showed no sign of realising the prime minister was talking nonsense and just kept his head down and stuck to the script.Unbelievably, that opening exchange turned out to have been the intellectual highpoint, and thereafter May and Corbyn failed to land a single punch. It was real bottom-of-the-bill entertainment. If that was a taster of a forthcoming general election leader’s debate it will be a ratings disaster. Give me a load of chimps killing one another any day. It would up the IQ levels by several points.Sajid Javid had an altogether rougher ride when the second day of the Brexit debate got under way around lunchtime. The home secretary is not short on self-regard and likes to consider himself one of the frontrunners to replace May when she finally gets round to doing the decent thing. But even he knows that the prime minister’s deal is a complete shambles and has no chance of getting though the Commons and his performance at the dispatch box reflected his lack of confidence in his own brief.“Um, er,” he mumbled, refusing to make eye contact with anyone. Um, er, basically the deal was a bit rubbish and the country’s security would be compromised a bit but, all in all, there probably wouldn’t to too many unnecessary deaths and he couldn’t think of anything better.Within 30 seconds of him starting his speech, at least half a dozen MPs from both sides of the house were piling in with their interventions. Javid ripped off his shirt and surrendered willingly to the onslaught. Northern Ireland would be remaining under the jurisdiction of the EU, the DUP’s Nigel Dodds barked. There was no mention of the international databases, SIS II or Ecris, in any of the draft agreements, Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs select committee observed.As the arrows rained down on him, Javid looked more and more miserable. There had to be better ways of earning a living than being home secretary for a government this useless. Yes, the deal was no more than a Santa wishlist, he burbled. But couldn’t everyone just hope for the best and hope that crims spontaneously decided to hand themselves in because they were so thrilled to be free from the jurisdiction of the EU.“Nnnnnnnnationnn,” whispered Javid. He was urged to speak up by the 100 or so MPs who had stayed to torment him. “Nnnnnnnnationnn,” he said again. It gradually dawned on everyone that the subject the home secretary was trying not to talk about was immigration. Simply because he had nothing to say. The government’s immigration white paper that had been first promised more than a year ago was still unwritten. So he had no idea what the government’s policy actually was. Other than that some bits would be the same, others would be a bit different and they hoped to get rid of a few foreignersCooper observed that only a couple of weeks previously, he had promised her committee the white paper would be available before next Tuesday’s vote. Was he going back on that? “Possibly,” Javid replied sulkily. Possibly, as in yes. It would definitely come by the end of December. December 2020.

After a rapid leadership contest, a different leader could appeal to a majority in parliament, perhaps by offering a softer deal.Tory backbenchers depose herJacob Rees-Mogg gets his way and there is a no-confidence vote. A new leader then tries to assemble a majority behind a tweaked deal.May calls a general electionMay could choose to take the ultimate gamble and hope that voters would back her deal, over the heads of squabbling MPs.Labour tries to force an electionThe opposition tables a vote of no confidence.\u0026nbsp​If May lost​,\u0026nbspthe opposition (or a new Conservative leader) would have two weeks to form an alternative government that could win a second confidence vote. If they were unable to do so, a general election would be triggered.A second referendum gathers supportThis is most likely if Labour makes a last-ditch decision to back it.\u0026nbspNo dealThe EU (Withdrawal) Act specifies 29 March 2019 as\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspday. Amber Rudd has said she believes parliament would stop a no deal, but it is not clear how it would do so.Another senior Brexiter called the idea a “risible, transparent ruse” and dismissed the No 10 strategists who came up with the compromise as “twerps”.The Conservative chief whip Julian Smith attended a private ERG meeting of about two dozen Tory MPs on Wednesday night, which was also attended by the DUP.Sources on both sides said that nothing new had been tabled by Downing Street and that the whip was in “listening mode”. He “answered lots and lots of questions”, said a person present, “but it wasn’t about doing deals, it was about listening and reporting back”.Separately, Rees-Mogg and Baker held a meeting with Nigel Dodds, the Westminster leader of May’s DUP informal coalition partners.An ERG statement said Dodd told them the DUP is so set against May’s Brexit plan that if it passed the Commons, the party would rescind its pledge to back her in any vote of confidence, placing the government in peril. If her deal falls they would support her.Amid a febrile atmosphere in Westminster ahead of Tuesday’s vote, the  also learned the Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, had privately told Labour MPs the party should have severe reservations about backing a fresh referendum, saying voters could see it as a betrayal.Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, hit back at McCluskey’s warning, saying that to suggest a second referendum would represent a betrayal was a “gross distortion” of the party’s position.At the heart of the Tory row over whether MPs should accept the prime minister’s deal is the legal status of the arrangements for preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland – and, in particular, the UK’s ability to extricate itself from this.Fresh details emerged on Wednesday as the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, finally published his full legal advice about the deal. The six-page document, a letter from Cox to May, was released after MPs voted the day before to hold the government in contempt of parliament for its repeated refusal to do so. The advice confirmed that, as Cox conceded in his Commons statement on Monday, the UK could remain “indefinitely” in the backstop.He wrote that the arrangements for avoiding a hard border could “endure”, even if negotiations between the two sides broke down. Cox also warned that disputes about whether the UK should be able to exit the backstop could become intractable.“In the absence of a right of termination, there is a legal risk that the United Kingdom might become subject to protracted and repeating rounds of negotiations,” he concluded.“This risk must be weighed against the political and economic imperative on both sides to reach an agreement that constitutes a politically stable and permanent basis for their future relationship. This is a political decision for the government.”Cox’s advice, which hardened the resolve of some Brexiters to vote against May’s deal, was published as the debate about the deal in the House of Commons entered the second of five scheduled days. As with the inaugural day, there was scant evidence of MPs on either side being convinced to change their minds.A string of former cabinet ministers, including Justine Greening and Michael Fallon, outlined what they saw as the deal’s failings, with Greening calling for a second referendum and Fallon saying he could only accept the deal with four separate changes.The theme for the second day was security and immigration, which meant the home secretary, Sajid Javid, opened proceedings, telling MPs he could not “think of a better way to celebrate my 49th birthday”. While noting that he could not insist the deal “is perfect in every sense”, Javid urged MPs to back it, warning of potentially lasting damage to security and policing if rejecting the plan resulted in a no-deal departure.But Sam Gyimah, who resigned as a junior education minister on Friday, joined Fallon and Greening in explaining why he could not support the government.“The home secretary admitted it might not be perfect, almost implying this is like trying on a pair of shoes, not the right colour, maybe a little bit tight but you could get on with it and life would be fine,” he said.“But actually this is like shoes that have holes in the soles. This deal is fatally flawed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09207a264307bca88a140e71da3acadcc5bec12/0_222_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3daf8815667f46119597d7950dd1ff61","title":"sajid javid says freedom of movement ends deal or no deal","story":"As the Brexit debate moved on to immigration, the home secretary decoupled a key aim from May’s agreementTheresa May’s deal offers the end of freedom of movement, a change that supporters of her offer say is crucial in delivering the Brexit for which people voted in 2016.As ending of freedom of movement is central to the deal, some MPs have been calling for the government to publish the white paper for its post-Brexit immigration bill before next week’s meaningful vote.The government has told those MPs this is not likely to happen. On Wednesday, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, said it was “still his intention” to publish it this month – a choice of words opposition MPs met with groans and sighs.Defending the delay, Javid told MPs: “It’s worth keeping in mind that this is the biggest change in our immigration system in four decades. It’s important that we take the time and we get it right.”Javid also said freedom of movement would end, “deal or no deal” – in effect saying that while it was a key part of the deal, it was not strictly tied to what May was offering.He also said MPs had been given glimpses of what the post-Brexit immigration system would look like.The government is proposing a single immigration system that treats migrants from EU countries in the same way as those from non-EU countries. Highly skilled workers who want to live and work in Britain will be given priority.However, the government says the ability of people from abroad to deliver services and student exchange programmes will form part of future trade agreements.Javid said he would consider scrapping the current cap of 20,700 on highly skilled migrants as part of the post-Brexit vision.Applicants will need to meet a minimum salary threshold – for highly skilled migrants this stands at £30,000 – but Javid has hinted this will be reviewed.Successful applicants for highly skilled work will be able to bring their immediate families, but only if sponsored by their future employers.For tourists and short-stay business trips, the government is looking at developing a system of e-gate visa checks for all countries considered low-risk.Passports would be scanned in airports, train stations and ports. All security and criminal records checks would be carried out in advance of visits, in a US-style system."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b6b2148dcdc22cb9335467008785c841980eb38/0_199_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fd259e78fd89ae6ace17795a787b4a7","title":"remain tory mp brexit clacton deal","story":"MP Giles Watling faces uphill task selling Theresa May’s Brexit deal to his constituents – and he hasn’t made up his own mind yetAs a remain-voting Conservative MP in one of only two places to ever send a Ukip representative to Westminster, Giles Watling faced an arguably uphill task anyway in selling Theresa May’s Brexit deal to his constituents in Clacton-on-Sea.But on this weekday afternoon walkabout there are more complications. First, the woman to whom Watling has begun his pitch inside a local hair salon is adamant she no longer listens to talk about Brexit. Then there is the small issue that the MP himself has not yet decided if he backs the prime minister’s plan.“I’m totally sick of it,” says Carol Kincaid, politely but firmly, her part-coloured hair in foils as she waits in a chair, the newly arrived Watling perched next to her. “When I hear the B-word, if it comes up on the radio, I go for the button so I can listen to music.”Tough audiences are nothing new to Watling, who was an actor and stage director before entering parliament in 2017, and is still probably the only politician to have pulled out of a touring production of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert to fight a byelection.He persists gently with Kincaid, but she is adamant: “I haven’t listened to the deal. I’m guilty of switching off. I don’t feel that people have any power with politicians. The banks and civil service run the country. Money runs the country.”Watling’s Essex constituency, which takes in prosperous districts as well as areas such as Jaywick, officially England’s most deprived neighbourhood, may not be typical of the fight to sell May’s Brexit plan to the masses, being disproportionately older and more pro-leave.But as Watling treks around the businesses and postwar bungalows of Burrsville, a mile or so north of the seafront, themes emerge that seem common nationally: people are bored of Brexit and want the process completed they admire May’s tenacity, but worry about her proposals.Watling, still known to some locals for playing an amiable vicar in the 1980s sitcom Bread, concurs: “There’s an enormous amount of people who just want it done, want some certainty, to get it over with. There is also a fear that we might inadvertently hand the keys of Downing Street to Jeremy Corbyn, just by not sorting it out.Watling’s mini-tour begins in the Robert Burre pub, a rare historic building in an area that was mainly countryside before the second world war. There, a representative from Heineken, the host brewery, quietly presses the MP on the need for business certainty.At the next table, the pub managers, Kelvin and Susan Davies, explain that talk of Brexit is rare among customers, the great majority of whom are – like the couple themselves – of retirement age. “They’re the only people around here with any money to spend,” says Kelvin, 72.He continues: “The vast majority of people, like myself, just wish it was over and done with, and we just get out. Ninety percent of our customers want to be out.“At the end of the day the consensus is: they’re scaremongering, they say we can never manage on our own. But we’re Great Britain, we managed for centuries on our own. We led the world. Why should we be afraid of going it alone now?”For all the gung-ho talk, Davies says he is reconciled to May’s plan, one that alarms most Brexiters in parliament: “I think Theresa May is doing a good job under the circumstances. There’s a lot of people against her at the moment, but she’s steering a good path. It seems the best deal we can get.”If this might sound reassuring for the prime minister, there is worse news when Watling starts knocking on doors in the surrounding houses, many occupied by people who left London and its suburbs for a quieter retirement – and cheaper property – by the coast.A woman who answers the door in a leopardskin onesie says she is still a supporter of Ukip, the party that represented Clacton after Douglas Carswell defected from the Conservatives in 2014, defeating Watling in the byelection, and then again in the 2015 election, before standing down.The woman, who gives her name only as Deborah, is scathing about the prospects for May’s departure plan: “The French will go on about fishing rights, the Spanish about Gibraltar, and all the nations in Europe have got to agree before they sign this off.”Watling tries to reassure her, but Deborah argues a no-deal Brexit is the only option: “I just want out. I voted to come out, simple as that. I don’t want to be tied to Europe at all. I’m not European. I’m English and I want our sovereignty back.”For all the vehemence, when asked about how May has performed, even Deborah concedes her respect – certainly when compared with the previous prime minister.“She seems strong. I don’t like the deal but I think she’s done pretty well. That Cameron – like what’s-his-name out of EastEnders said, he’s got on his trotters and run, and left us. Simple as that.”Watling says respect for May is a sentiment he hears from those holding more or less every shade of Brexit opinion: “Theresa May on a personal level has massive support. I think any vote of no confidence would fall immediately. And that’s why it hasn’t happened. Nobody wants the job, either. Who would want a job like that? You might agree or disagree with her position, but you can’t fault her for stamina or resilience.”It has already been an eventful few weeks for Watling. Last month the MP was driving home from London on a Thursday evening when an emergency call from the BBC saw him erted to the filming of that week’s Question Time in Clacton, after the Treasury secretary, Liz Truss, was stuck on a train. He jokes it is not the first time he has been an emergency understudy.Watling, 65, now faces the most taxing decision of his slightly unexpected late second career in national politics, when MPs vote on Tuesday on May’s deal.He has submitted his own amendment to the motion, seeking to reduce the potential scope of the European court of justice if the Northern Irish backstop plan comes into force.He says: “I speak as a remainer, who wouldn’t have done this in the first place, but if we’re going to go through all this pain and uncertainty, and at the end of it we don’t have sovereignty and the European court of justice has dominion over the backstop, then what’s been the point?”In the coming days Watling will face yet more competing demands from sceptical constituents and Conservative whips.He says: “I do get it in the neck from everybody, from all sides. That goes with the territory. But there is an enormous amount of pressure building to just sign the thing, get it sorted. I have my issues with it, but I’m really sympathetic.”Amid all this, Watling confirms, he has yet to decide whether to back the prime minister: “A week really is a long time in politics, and I think it’s foolish to declare your position this long before the event.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9b34a5bd51d25d5fe1adda234b3260c4b7b052d/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=436802c2a2ebd49ea2b88348fd924da3","title":"from plants to pets how to make your office a stress free zone","story":"Whether you bring dogs to work or introduce some greenery to your desk, these tips will help your workplace feel more relaxedNot every employer has the financial means for mass yoga sessions and relaxing off-site trips, but there are still ways to bring wellness to the workplace.“In simple terms, stress is the result of our mind preparing our body to respond to a perceived threat,” says Litzi Essler, founder of Happy Engine coaching. “The key word here is ‘perceived’ – as, in modern life, we spend a lot of time worrying about things that haven’t happened.” This can cause constant feelings of anxiety, as you prepare to deal with all the possible problems that may occur, she says.Whether you work on your own, you have a small business or manage hundreds of employees, making sure your colleagues and employees aren’t under undue levels of stress is critical to having a successful business. And it doesn’t have to break the bank.Scattering plants around the officeYou don’t need to be a botanist to realise the positive effect plants can have on an environment, and the workplace is no different. Plants that have been shown to have a de-stressing effect include aloe vera, peace lilies, bamboo palm, spider plants and rubber trees. Try dotting a few of these on your desk and around the office and see what the effect is on people’s moods.Allowing petsThe act of stroking a dog has been shown to increase levels of a hormone called oxytocin in both the dog and the human, while reducing cortisol levels in the person, too. Oxytocin is a happy hormone, whereas, cortisol is related to stress. So stroking dogs makes you happier and less stressed.At the UK Mars Petcare offices, dogs are a constant feature. “What’s amazing about having dogs in the office is the genuine relationship of support that can build over time between people and pets,” says Essler, who also works at a pet care company.“I often notice people taking short breaks in their day to stroke, cuddle or play with the dogs, which relieves their stress and over time builds a positive bond with the dog,” she says. “This unconditional relationship is extremely beneficial in challenging environments and often I see dogs seeking to comfort those who are having a difficult day.”Creating a stress-free zoneTaking time away from the threat – or perceived threat – that’s making you stressed has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to overcome it. This is why having a separate area that people can go to when they feel overwhelmed will help improve the wellbeing of people in your office. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy it might be a coffee area or simply a corner of the office with beanbags or cushions.Socialising“We’re only a small team, but spending time together outside of the workplace to relax, bond, laugh and reflect has improved productivity and team dynamics endlessly,” says Ben Barker, founder of cold-brew coffee company Artemis Brew.“It can be as simple, cheap and non-disruptive as you make it,” he says. His team has been to events such as escape rooms and independent film festivals, and it usually involves a beer or two afterwards.Playing musicMusic can be comforting, relaxing and it has been shown to increase productivity. Instead of having everyone listening to their own music through headphones, try playing music in your office to help people feel less stressed.“We have the radio playing in all areas of the building,” says Tracey Dawson, managing director at Daletech Electronics, a company with 14 employees.Or, if you’re in the mood for something a bit different, why not try a podcast?“We love having music on in the office, but more recently we’ve been putting podcasts on, too, which are a great alternative,” says James Gupta, founder and CEO at Synap, an online education platform.Communication is keyMaking sure everyone knows what is going on helps to manage stress, says Gupta. “At the beginning of every week, we have a team meeting to discuss what we’ll each be working on,” he says. “The development team get to see how their work is being received by customers, and the sales team have an understanding of when new features are likely to be available.”Provide healthy snacks“We try to encourage active, healthy lifestyles, so we supply free fruit and we have a company lunch together once a week,” says Dawson.Healthy eating has been shown to help stress levels decrease, and if someone is working to a deadline, having a quick, healthy snack might be exactly what they need to get through a busy morning. Offering caffeine-free alternatives to tea and coffee can also help keep tempers from boiling over and keep the jitters at bay.Celebrate success“Celebrating success is important,” says Gillian Rattray, entrepreneur acceleration manager at Royal Bank of Scotland.Recognising small wins such as hitting certain revenue targets or securing an important meeting helps even out the rollercoaster of running a business. “At the moment, we are looking carefully at celebration,” says Dawson. “As a first step, we have installed a ship’s bell that we ring each time an order leaves the building.”“In my own business, we had fizz days – we bought a bottle of sparkling wine when we made £1,000 or more in a day,” says Rattray. “The more revenue we earned, the more fizz we bought!”SEAT believes in helping people move forward by making it easier to get to the good stuff.

With Itoje’s current contract at the Premiership champions due to expire next summer, the  understands Harlequins could be among the suitors should the England forward opt for a fresh challenge.Since signing his last club contract in 2016, Itoje has developed into an international regular and was a starting British \u0026amp Irish Lion in the New Zealand Tests last year. With average player wages having also risen and the salary cap fixed until 2020, even a champion club like Saracens are being forced to make increasingly tough decisions about whom to retain and release.No club, however, are officially allowed to approach Itoje before 1 January and Saracens believe the 24-year-old will end up staying in north London. “Talks with Maro have been unbelievably positive,” said a club spokesman, suggesting the player was “in no rush” to leave the club with whom he signed his first professional contract in 2012.Since then Itoje has helped Saracens win back-to-back European Cups, three Premiership titles and helped England claim two Six Nations titles. Saracens’ director of rugby, Mark McCall, has long felt clubs who produce players who subsequently develop into top internationals should be granted special dispensation under the salary cap.“It would be an unbelievable shame if we had to lose players we have grown ourselves,” he said last year. “My view is that if you genuinely bring a player through your academy system then there should be a limit on what he costs you in the salary cap. To be penalised for having all these academy players who are only asking for their market value and not to be able to afford them doesn’t seem right.”Saracens, who face Cardiff Blues in the Champions Cup on Sunday, have a raft of key England squad members on their books along with Itoje, including Owen Farrell, the Vunipola brothers, Jamie George, George Kruis, Richard Wigglesworth, Nick Isiekwe and Alex Lozowski. Keeping all of them happy may well mean bidding farewell to several older squad members in 2019, even though the World Cup will deprive the club of a large chunk of their squad at the beginning of next season.Exeter’s highly-respected director of rugby, Rob Baxter, meanwhile, says he is no hurry to apply for the England head coach’s job following next year’s World Cup. Nigel Melville, the Rugby Football Union’s interim chief executive, says he intends to start “meeting everyone who is a potential target for us” in the new year but Baxter remains to be convinced the role would suit him.“If I’m honest with you it doesn’t feel like I’m ready to move into my next job,” he told the . “If someone said, ‘Are you ready to start saying ‘I want to have the England job’ or throw my hat into the ring’, I’d probably say no.“ People are probably aware of the unique situation I’m in here.“I like to think I’m not one of those people you could describe as a career coach, who constantly moves around. I’ve always been Exeter-based. That’s where I am until my wife suddenly decides she doesn’t want to live in Exeter any more – and that doesn’t look likely at the moment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e87a5994b40f48e8bd8c4f137c549d02e97d9dd/0_66_3060_1836/master/3060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b17266f1104d4583a5d222e59de3cb37","title":"australia v india first test day one live","story":"That dismissal brings the curtain down on a topsy-turvy day of Test cricket. Australia will be the happier of the two sides but India will feel like they escaped serious humiliation courtesy of Cheteshwar Pujara’s century. 88th over: India 250-9 (Shami 6) More runs for India. First Shami gets off strike early with a guided dab down to third man. Pujara then picks up a couple through midwicket, a couple with a ramp down to third-man, and a couple more with a fierce straight drive. Imperious stuff from the day’s defining figure. But - oh no - what has he done!? Finally delivery of the over, looking to milk the strike he bunts Hazlewood straight to Cummins at mid-on and chances the arm. Not Cummins. The big quick swoops in, es, and fires unerringly at one stump to send Pujara home. Scintillating fielding. Pujara departs to a well-earned round of applause. 87th over: India 243-8 (Pujara 117, Shami 5) Into the final ten minutes of play, which means Australia will not bat today. Despite the lengthening shadows Pujara is keen to keep the scoreboard ticking over and he takes the initiative to Mitchell Starc. In an assertive over he cuts for a rank long hop for a flat six, whips a four through square-leg and lofts two straight back over the bowler’s head. India edging towards a reasonable score after earlier staring humiliation in the face. 86th over: India 231-8 (Pujara 105, Shami 5) A weary Hazlewood continues and Pujara accepts a single offered to the third delivery. Shami survives the remaining trio. Pujara’s innings has also seen him pass 5,000 Test runs. Suitably, considering the similarities, the milestone was achieved in the same number of innings as Rahul Dravid. Wall to wall accumulation. 85th over: India 229-8 (Pujara 103, Shami 5) A single to Shami second ball brings Pujara on strike and India’s lynchpin calmly whips Starc off his pads to bring up his 16th Test century, one earned from a gruelling 231 deliveries. He should have been out in the 80s during the previous over but his patience and concentration have been rewarded. This has been a vital innings for India and an example to the rest of the top order.84th over: India 224-8 (Pujara 99, Shami 4) Hazlewood continues and it’s another eventful over! Three innocuous deliveries presage a fourth that looks like a routine caught behind, but only the bowler appeals despite an audible nick noise. A review would surely have brought about the dismissal with snicko revealing a tiny edge. Frustrated, Hazlewood goes upstairs for his next two deliveries only for Pujara to hook him for six and four to move to 99. Who’d be a bowler?83rd over: India 214-8 (Pujara 89, Shami 4) That was an eventful over. Aside from the wicket Starc almost had Pujara but his streaky drive went through the vacant third slip region, then Shami drove his first ball square for four. Third over with the new ball and Starc has his man, ripping a fast inswinger through Sharma’s defence, off his pads and onto the stumps. 82nd over: India 208-7 (Pujara 87, Sharma 4) Hazlewood shares the new ball but his opening three deliveries are well wide of Pujara’s off stump, the fourth is whipped to leg for a couple and the fifth is driven nonchalantly for a single in textbook strike-farming fashion. Sharma defends ball six. The fatigue of such a tiring day looks to be telling on Australia’s quicks. “I might be a “traditionalist” but with the ODIs behind pay walls it has seemed a very low key beginning to what should be a cracking series,” emails Carl Jepson. “The malarkey re Cricket Australia wouldn’t have helped either.” I’m sure there’ll be more analysis of the attendance to follow but considering the full houses for the day-night Tests in recent years it does seem odd that there could be so many empty seats for the first day of such a marquee series.81st over: India 206-7 (Pujara 85, Sharma 4) Starc with the new cherry, Sharma on strike, catchers converge from all angles the last 40 minutes of play promise to be gripping. Or perhaps not. Starc strays legside with his opening three deliveries but then the action happens! Sharma is lucky to escape the LBW decision on review, offering on shot to a length delivery. Sharma survives, somehow! The big quick offered no shot to a Starc thunderbolt from over the wicket. Nigel Llong raised the finger but DRS revealed the ball would bounce over the bails. Very very lucky Sharma. Sharma out LBW...80th over: India 206-7 (Pujara 85, Sharma 4) Final over before the new ball is due and Travis Head is the man who bowls it, firing through a speedy maiden over of darts across Pujara from around the wicket. Sharma will be on strike at the start of the next over. 79th over: India 206-7 (Pujara 85, Sharma 4) Lyon sending down perhaps his final over of the day. Pujara begins on strike, working a couple THROUGH THE HANDS of the short backward square leg fielder. That was a very very tough chance, but they sometimes stick - especially if the fielder is Keaton Jennings. Hmmmm, what have we here? The intensity of that second run looks to have done Pujara some damage. Cramp? A hammy? Pujara has been out there pretty much all day and he’s faced 208 deliveries of his own. The physio is out to have a look and after a few stretches the day’s key figure is fit to continue. Not only that but he guides two through the vacant gully region then milks the strike with a nifty single. This is a masterclass from Pujara. A surprisingly modest number considering the combatants and the venue. 78th over: India 199-7 (Pujara 78, Sharma 4) Pujara farming the strike beautifully this Cummins over, declining a series of singles before driving through the covers for three, leaving Sharma just one ball to negotiate, which he does with ease. 77th over: India 196-7 (Pujara 75, Sharma 4) Oi oi! Sharma dabs the opening delivery of the over back to the bowler then drops to one knee and slog sweeps Lyon for four over square-leg. He props forward and defends the next four deliveries to make it a tidy over for India. 76th over: India 192-7 (Pujara 75, Sharma 0) Pujara is trying to get a bit of a wriggle on now, looking to score from the early deliveries of this Cummins over. He then reverts to looking for the single to farm the strike but fails. Can Sharma survive another Lyon over following his previous travails? 75th over: India 190-7 (Pujara 73, Sharma 0) India down to the tail now and with the new ball due shortly the end could well be nigh. Lyon tries to bring about the end with the old ball, terrorising Sharma on outside edge, inside edge and with length, failing with a host of testing deliveries including one that spun through the gate but somehow managed to miss timber, and then failing to review successfully the appeal for the catch behind. Lyon has turned Sharma inside out this over and thinks he has a catch down the legside from his final delivery but DRS reveals no inside edge.  Sharma not out...The drinks break does it! Australia are finally rewarded for their effort since Tea, Ashwin squared up by a beauty from Cummins, the ball kissing the shoulder of the bat and taken safely by Handscomb at second slip. 73rd over: India 184-6 (Pujara 71, Ashwin 21) Lyon rattles through this over, Ashwin repelling all half-dozen, despite a couple of stifled oohs and ahhs from the close fielders. Another excellent point. It might not be the worst idea to open with someone like Ashwin against this attack in these conditions. He doesn’t need to score heavily, just take the shine off the new ball and establish a platform for the quality runscorers to follow. 72nd over: India 184-6 (Pujara 71, Ashwin 21) Paine continues to shuffle his pacemen during what Damien Fleming call’s the graveyard shift with this old ball. Pat Cummins has another trundle hitting a consistent line and length that on a greentop with a new ball would be near unplayable. However, this is a flat surface with a Kookaburra ready to be peeled and mashed. You certainly cannot fault Australia’s effort this evening despite the lack of a breakthrough.71st over: India 183-6 (Pujara 71, Ashwin 20) Lyon continues his grind, shifting his approach to around the wicket from over, and it costs him runs to begin with as his line is too close to Ashwin’s pads, allowing a finely glanced three. He moves back over to Pujara and he has a couple of nibbles, most notably last ball with the batsman seeming to lob a bat-pad chance into the empty space where a short cover might have been placed. Replays indicate it was all pad.70th over: India 180-6 (Pujara 71, Ashwin 17) Another over full of effort for little reward by Josh Hazlewood. He must be hoping his two-over spell doesn’t go for much longer with the new ball around the corner. This partnership now 53 and perhaps as importantly it’s kept Australia in the field for 21 energy-sapping overs. Agree on both counts Ravi. This next nine over phase becomes an interesting mind game - should India look to make hay while they can against the old ball before the movement and bounce of the new ball turns thoughts back to survival?69th over: India 178-6 (Pujara 69, Ashwin 17) That was just an end-change break for the GOAT with Lyon continuing his role of keeping his pacemen fresh for the second new ball. Not his best over though, drifting too close to the hip of both right-handers, then overcorrecting, allowing Pujara to use his feet and drill a three down the ground. Despite that Australia almost get another freebie with Ashwin bunting tamely in the air towards midwicket but the ball landed short of the waiting fielder. 68th over: India 172-6 (Pujara 64, Ashwin 16) Lyon’s long spell comes to an end, allowing Josh Hazlewood to send down his 15th over of the day. Very Hazlewood areas this over but with a ball this old on a pitch this flat there isn’t a great deal to worry Ashwin. 67th over: India 171-6 (Pujara 64, Ashwin 15) Both right-handed batsmen handle the latest Cummins over, defending anything straight, leaving anything outside off or short, and collecting the singles on offer. “Just finished an eleven hour shift in the kitchen (I’m not a fan of Christmas)“ begins Phil Withall’s email, “and now catching up with the cricket. At what point do we start saying that Australia are letting things slip away from them?”Good question. I think we’re another hour or so away from that. Despite this partnership nearing 50 the run-rate remains slow and Australia will be happy to keep things ticking over until the second new ball in this fierce heat. The final 30-40 minutes of play promise to be decisive. If India can see it through the close only six down, then Tim Paine might have some questions to answer but let’s wait until that ten over new-ball burst.66th over: India 167-6 (Pujara 61, Ashwin 14) Lyon continues to ask questions, bringing the short leg and the backward short leg fielders into play with his famous overspin bounce. Both batsmen survive but without much elegance. 65th over: India 165-6 (Pujara 60, Ashwin 13) First bowling change since tea with Cummins replacing Starc from the Cathedral End. Ashwin welcomes him to the crease by leaning in to a textbook cover drive for a couple. A further single keeps the scoreboard ticking over.It is flippin’ hot out there.64th over: India 162-6 (Pujara 60, Ashwin 10) Rapid over from Lyon, now into the 15th of his spell, building the pressure on India with a testing line and length. Ashwin navigates it thoughtfully and collects a single to move into double figures.63rd over: India 161-6 (Pujara 60, Ashwin 9) Sniff of a chance early in this Starc over but Ashwin’s short-arm jab lands safely in the legside after spending plenty of time int he air. PROPER CHANCE next delivery with Pujara driving loosely outside off stump to a full delivery but his drive just flashes above the fingertips of a ing Khawaja at gully. Pujara fortunate to escape there, perhaps saved by his commitment to the stroke. Another feather in Seven’s cap with their coverage has been some excellent and creative montage music. The latest offering was this belter from The Kinks.62nd over: India 156-6 (Pujara 56, Ashwin 8) Pujara continues to hog the strike, drawing the sting out of Lyon deep into a ferociously hot day. Australia appeal a couple of times for LBW but the batsman appears to be comfortably outside the line of off stump on both occasions. 61st over: India 154-6 (Pujara 55, Ashwin 7) Australia have been unable to sustain pressure on Ashwin since tea and he escapes strike from the first ball of Starc’s over with an easy legside single. Pujara plays an uncharacteristic swish-and-miss outside off next ball though to remind the hosts he is human and not a robot. On the subject of the TV coverage, does it represent a banner day for Tasmanian cricket? Apple Islander Tim Lane called the opening ball and Launceston’s Ricky Ponting provided the first piece of analysis, in a match containing a Hobartian skipper. 60th over: India 152-6 (Pujara 52, Ashwin 6) Pujara is in the zone now, working a couple of twos off a serviceable Lyon over and now looking like a run-scoring batsman than someone just looking to preserve his wicket. 59th over: India 148-6 (Pujara 50, Ashwin 6) Pujara navigates another Starc over and reaches his fifty in the process, nurdling a couple and then a single off his pads with the minimum of fuss. The old fashioned ease with which Pujara has gone about his work is an indictment on the recklessness of his colleagues. After a lively opening hour this is now a pitch full of runs against a tiring attack and a softening ball. I’ve been largely on Seven’s coverage and have enjoyed it - considerably more than recent efforts from Nine. Ricky Ponting is the best analyst in the business. 58th over: India 145-6 (Pujara 47, Ashwin 6) Lyon shares bowling duties with Starc and he’s on the money straight away, inducing an inside-edge from Ashwin that interests short-leg. Enlivened by the let-off Ashwin dashes through for a single that requires his partner to e desperately to secure his ground. Not the best backing up, nor the safest run in the world considering the match situation. Excellent probing over to continue a superb day from Australia’s number one offie. 57th over: India 143-6 (Pujara 46, Ashwin 5) Mitchell Starc bowls the first over after tea and he’s lucky an early loosener isn’t cut for four. That was in Robin Smith back foot thwack territory but India’s number three could only find one of the ring fielders. Speaking of fielders, Aaron Finch is at an unusual thirdish slip, a few metres in front of a conventional third and wearing a helmet. After that early run-scoring opportunity Starc sends down five straighter deliveries that Pujara is happy to see off. We’re looking at a 34 over final session which means we’re likely to eat in to the extra half hour allocated to accommodate tardy modern over-rates. I will be on deck for the next couple of hours, anchoring this opening day of the series to a close. Please keep me company, either on Twitter - @JPHowcroft - or by email - jonathan.howcroft.freelance@the. Plenty to discuss: India’s batting, Australia’s bowling, or perhaps the brave new world of Australian TV and radio commentary. Whatever crosses your mind, send it my way please. Another break reached for India. They looked better in that session, but still two wickets fell, and they were both dangerous fast-scoring batsmen in Rohit and Pant. This ground will be beautiful for batting tomorrow and India will probably surrender that chance to Australia. But for now, they have hope as long as Pujara sticks around, and as long as Ashwin supports him. There’s plenty more fight required for India to at least pass a mark of 250 or so that would give them some stake in the game. Remember that Australia and batting have not gone together that well in recent times.For the meantime though, the Australians and their supporters would be feeling pretty cheery. A bit like this.That’s enough from me – from here, enjoy the sultry textual tones of Jonathan Penguin Howcroft. I don’t know what his middle initial stands for so I’ve decided to improvise. Don’t believe him if he corrects me.56th over: India 143-6 (Pujara 46, Ashwin 5) Lyon with the last over before the break, and Pujara plays one of his nicest shots today: an elegant cover drive for three runs. He’s moving serenly towards a half century, whose presence on the stats sheet would not adequately convey how laudable the effort has been to compile it.55th over: India 140-6 (Pujara 43, Ashwin 5) Travis Head gets a bowl! The part-time offie on his home ground is a decent option - doesn’t have bags of wickets but has picked up a few across all formats. He’s more a way of filling in till tea than a hope of ripping through the batting, you’d think.54th over: India 138-6 (Pujara 42, Ashwin 4) A single from the Lyon over. Ashwin looking solid so far.A few people advancing this view. 53rd over: India 137-6 (Pujara 42, Ashwin 3) Pujara has been very cautious today, but plays another uppercut very deliberately over the cordon when Hazlewood gives width. That’s a risk Che does not believe is incompatible with his role a sentinel. “Don’t confuse not playing the shots with not having the shots,” says Ed Cowan on radio.52nd over: India 131-6 (Pujara 37, Ashwin 2) Another couple of singles from a calm Lyon over. This is the cake that will be awaiting the bowler in the dressing room.51st over: India 129-6 (Pujara 36, Ashwin 1) Handscomb has crept right up to a short third slip at the moment. Hazlewood’s the bowler. Handscomb is wearing a helmet and remaining down in a crouch after the ball is bowled, like a short leg. I think he’s there not so much in realistic hopes of a catch, but just to get in Pujara’s head. To make the batsman change the way he’s been playing, so happy to run the ball softly into the cordon. Just get into his head a bit. Handscomb has done this quite a lot at Victoria, where the tactic has been used a number of times on the slow MCG pitch. Che sees out a maiden.50th over: India 129-6 (Pujara 36, Ashwin 1) Pujara is increasingly the lone man for India. Ravi Ashwin the next in. A couple around the bat on the leg side, for both batsmen. Two right-handers. Looking for Lyon to turn the ball into them and draw an edge round the corner to leg slip. Instead the pair work a couple of singles through square.He’s Handsy Cronje! One wicketkeeper follows the ball with his bat, the other wicketkeeper takes the edge. Perfect stuff to a lefty from Lyon, who produces that so often. Around the wicket, lots of loop, lots of bounce, turning away slightly from the bat. It drew Pant forward into the shot, made him follow the ball just a couple of inches with his gloves, and that was enough. The revs on the ball saw it dip and leap. Umpire Dharmasena thinks about it a good long while before confirming there was a tiny nick, at which point Pant agrees.49th over: India 127-5 (Pujara 35, Pant 25) We’ve seen Pujara edge several times today with very soft hands. It saves him again this time, and nets him a couple of runs as the ball scurries through the cordon. Hazlewood in his new over is unimpressed.48th over: India 125-5 (Pujara 33, Pant 25) Pujara works Lyon for a couple of singles comfortably. Pant is less orthodox, jabbing one to midwicket and later trying to dab a ball away fro just outside off. The rebuild is on, but correspondent Ravi is fierce about the collapse.They weren’t much chop on their final tour to Australia, but in general you’re probably right.47th over: India 122-5 (Pujara 31, Pant 24) No need to play a wild shot when the fast bowler sends down a low full toss. Pant keeps his shape (must be quality denim) and drives it through cover for four. Clean and clear. Cummins responds with a very sharp bouncer that whiffles past the nose of the batsman.Australia still on top. Patrick O’Brien on the email has tongue slightly in cheek: “This is a real win for the nice guys of world cricket.”46th over: India 118-5 (Pujara 31, Pant 20) Pant facing the spinner now. He gets an inside edge first ball that saves him from an lbw shout, then stands up tall and whips a couple of runs in the air through forward square leg. Blocks a couple, then works a single. Decent stuff so far. He’s had the most eventful first 20 since Alexander the Great."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e23b77b24113cd482046d96ce46ef53fe76e1bb9/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49792aefa5d31c7a48a70a0628554bbf","title":"choose your favourite stage show of 2018","story":"Which plays left you speechless?

It is odd, original, inventively staged by Helen Goalen and Abbi Greenland from RashDash, and vigorously performed by its six-strong cast. But in its fury, it leaves little room for doubt, argument or internal challenge.In physics, matter falling into a black hole may collapse to a point of infinite density or re-explode to appear as a white hole in another universe. Kendrick applies that idea to women’s history. First we see a number of women, seeking to articulate their ideas, disappearing down a black hole. When they re-emerge, they are vengeful, angry but united in their quest for power and their resentment at centuries of oppression.They sing, chant, sprout black wings, retell the stories of Pandora and Medusa and, in one particularly effective passage questioning the male gaze, remind us that elementary particles don’t like being watched.The Theatre Upstairs stage is constantly alive with movement, and Katharine Williams’s lighting is dazzling. The six actors – Ronke Adekoluejo, Ebony Bones, Alison Halstead, Rubyyy Jones, Cassie Layton, Eva Magyar – are highly inidual while expressing a choric rage. But I still found myself puzzled by Kendrick’s purpose.

Earlier this week the head of MI6 also suggested the UK needed to decide if it was “comfortable” with Chinese ownership of the technology being used.On Wednesday it emerged that Canada has arrested Huawei’s global chief financial officer in Vancouver, where she is facing extradition to the US in a move likely to exacerbate tensions between the US and China.Meng Wanzhou, one of the vice-chairs on the Chinese technology company’s board and the daughter of the company founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested on 1 December. A court hearing has been set for Friday, according to Canada’s department of justice.In a statement, the UK telecoms group has confirmed it is in the process of removing Huawei equipment from the key parts of its 3G and 4G networks to meet an existing internal policy not to have the Chinese firm at the centre of its infrastructure.“In 2016, following the acquisition of EE, we began a process to remove Huawei equipment from the core of our 3G and 4G mobile networks, as part of network architecture principles in place since 2006,” BT said. “We’re applying these same principles to our current RFP (request for proposal) for 5G core infrastructure. As a result, Huawei have not been included in vendor selection for our 5G core. Huawei remains an important equipment provider outside the core network and a valued innovation partner.”The news comes in the wake of the head of MI6, Alex Younger, questioning whether Chinese firms such as Huawei should be involved in UK communications infrastructure.He said that the UK would have to make “some decisions” about such firms after other governments had taken steps to block the firm. “We need to decide the extent to which we are going to be comfortable with Chinese ownership of these technologies and these platforms in an environment where some of our allies have taken a very definite position,” he said.Huawei was founded by a former officer in the People’s Liberation Army and questions have been raised about the firm’s links to the Chinese state.A recent report to the US congress by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission suggested the Chinese government “exerts strong influence over its firms” and could “force Chinese suppliers or manufacturers to modify products to perform below expectations or fail, facilitate state or corporate espionage, or otherwise compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability” of devices and networks that use them.Huawei has always denied any improper links to the Chinese government. In their own statement, the company said: “Huawei has been working with BT for almost 15 years. Since the beginning of this partnership, BT has operated on a principle of different vendors for different network layers.“This agreement remains in place today. Since it acquired EE in 2016, the BT Group has been actively bringing EE’s legacy network architecture in line with this longstanding agreement. This is a normal and expected activity, which we understand and fully support. Working together, we have already completed a number of successful 5G trials across different sites in London and we will continue to work with BT in the 5G era.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba6e448cbd6a435d0359f07c69323707d90a59aa/0_113_5354_3212/master/5354.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=923f3e2ec3c9fe75eb8ef15db21363d6","title":"facebook discussed cashing in on user data emails suggest","story":"Social network staff apparently conversed about removing data restrictions for big ad spendersFacebook staff in 2012 discussed selling access to user data to major advertisers, before ultimately deciding to restrict such access two years later, according to a tranche of internal emails released by the UK parliament.The internal emails were obtained by the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) committee last month after they had been disclosed, under seal, by Facebook as part of a lawsuit against it by the American software developer, Six4Three.The emails are a selection, often with little or no context or continuity, showing Facebook staff, including the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, discussing whether to trade access to user data for revenue, valuable trademarks or simple cash payments. The emails also cast new light on a number of other controversial practices at the social network:Damian Collins, the chair of the DCMS committee, which released the emails, said: “The files show evidence of Facebook taking aggressive positions against apps, with the consequence that denying them access to data led to the failure of that business.“It is clear that increasing revenues from major app developers was one of the key drivers behind the Platform 3.0 changes at Facebook,” Collins added. “The idea of linking access to friends’ data to the financial value of the developers’ relationship with Facebook is a recurring feature of the documents.”The emails show Facebook staff discussing how to use access to user data to extract concessions such as higher advertising spend from major clients, in conversations dating from 2012 and 2013.In one email to employees, Zuckerberg, said of the proposals: “Sometimes the best way to enable people to share something is to have a developer build a special purpose app or network for that type of content and to make that app social by having Facebook plug into it.“However, that may be good for the world but it’s not good for us unless people also share back to Facebook and that content increases the value of our network. So ultimately, I think the purpose of platform – even the read side – is to increase sharing back into Facebook.”The discussions occurred at roughly the time that Facebook decided to change the way third-party developers could access user data, which had the effect of closing the hole through which Cambridge Analytica’s UK parent company, Strategic Communications Laboratories’ partner GSR, had managed to extract the personal information of millions of Facebook users.Elsewhere, the filings suggest Facebook offered to extend the length of time Tinder could continue using the old, more permissive terms of access in exchange for a licence for the dating company’s trademark on the term “moments”.In emails, Zuckerberg discussed similar limitations, proposing that access to user data be restricted either to companies who were making content that would be shared with Facebook – or to those who were willing to pay for it.In an October 2012 email, Zuckerberg wrote that companies could pay the money they owed by buying adverts on Facebook, using the company’s payments infrastructure, selling items in its store, “or if the revenue we get from those doesn’t add up to more than the fees you owe us, then you just pay us the fee directly”.There is no suggestion that Facebook acted on the proposals to charge for access, and the company has always maintained that it tightened the restrictions on what could be done with its user data for privacy and security reasons.The filings are drawn from a set of Facebook emails obtained by Six4Three’s legal advisers in the discovery portion of its lawsuit against the social network, subsequently sealed by the Californian court. In late November, however, the UK parliament obtained copies of the emails from Six4Three’s chief executive and quoted from them during its questioning of a Facebook executive the following week.In a statement, Facebook’s director of developer platforms and programs, Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, told the : “As we’ve said many times, the documents Six4Three gathered for this baseless case are only part of the story and are presented in a way that is very misleading without additional context.” Facebook declined a request to provide the  with the emails in their additional context.Papamiltiadis added: “That said, we stand by the platform changes we made in 2015 to stop a person from sharing their friends’ data with developers. Any short-term extensions granted during this platform transition were to prevent the changes from breaking user experience.“To be clear, Facebook has never sold anyone’s data. Our APIs have always been free of charge and we have never required developers to pay for using them, either directly or by buying advertising.”On Tuesday, the day before the emails were released, Facebook reversed the policy under which it had banned Vine from its platform. “As part of our ongoing review we have decided that we will remove this out-of-date policy so that our platform remains as open as possible. We think this is the right thing to do as platforms and technology develop and grow,” the company said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afb56426acdde6984c0f7c6b9e54d4df66d36702/206_606_5656_3394/master/5656.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4204f53ea48b032d5385c61fb10c8ca7","title":"facebook documents uk parliament key facts","story":"Emails show Zuckerberg targeted Twitter’s Vine and gave some companies special data access, among other revelationsThe UK parliament has published a cache of confidential Facebook documents it obtained from a plaintiff in a California lawsuit. The records, which have been under seal in US courts, provided a rare window into internal discussions at the social network about privacy, user data, the company’s handling of competitors and more.Facebook’s director of developer platforms and programs, Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, told the  in an earlier statement that the documents from the lawsuit “are only part of the story and are presented in a way that is very misleading without additional context”.Here are some key takeaways from the files.The documents revealed that when Twitter launched its video app Vine in 2013, Facebook was quick to respond by limiting the app’s access to its own user data. CEO Mark Zuckerberg directly approved this decision, the emails show.Zuckerberg responded: “Yup, go for it.”The company said this week that Zuckerberg and others were following its policy at the time governing competitor apps’ data access. On Tuesday, before the documents were released, Facebook announced it would remove this “out of date policy so that our platform remains as open as possible”, moving away from its restrictions on “apps built on top of our platform that replicated our core functionality”.The documents shed light on internal discussions before it was publicly revealed that Facebook logged text messages and phone calls through smartphone apps. In 2015, Facebook started “continuously uploading” logs from Android phones, eventually prompting a privacy scandal.The communications showed that Facebook was focused on minimizing negative publicity in the rollout of these features.“This is a pretty high-risk thing to do from a PR perspective but it appears that the growth team will charge ahead and do it,” one internal email said, predicting the possible backlash. “We think the risk of PR fallout here is high … Screenshot of the scary Android permissions screen becomes a meme … it gets press attention, and enterprising journalists dig into what exactly the new update is requesting, then write stories about ‘Facebook uses new Android update to pry into your private life in ever more terrifying ways’.”The emails also implied that Facebook considered whether it could “upgrade” Android users to give access to phone data without “subjecting them” to a specific “permissions dialog”.An internal email said: “The Growth team is now exploring a path where we only request Read Call Log permission, and hold off on requesting other permissions for now. Based on their initial testing, it seems that this would allow us to upgrade users without subjecting them to an Android permissions dialog at all. It would still be a breaking change, so users would have to click to upgrade, but no permissions dialog screen.”Presumably, this “path” could have decreased transparency around a critical privacy matter. Facebook said in a statement Wednesday that the feature in question “allows people to opt in to giving Facebook access to their call and text messaging logs” in the Messenger app on Android devices. “We use this information to do things like make better suggestions for people to call in Messenger.”A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment on the outcome of the specific “permissions dialog” exchange in the emails, but the company’s statement said: “The feature is opt-in for users and we ask for people’s permission before enabling. We always consider the best way to ask for a person’s permission, whether that’s through a permission dialog set by a mobile operating system like Android or iOS, or a permission we design in the Facebook app.”The statement added: “This was not a discussion about avoiding asking people for permission.”The records offered some insight into how Facebook used Onavo, a security app that it owns which provides users with a free virtual private network (VPN) that is supposed to provide a “safer connection” for accessing apps or the web on mobile.But there has been growing concern that Onavo’s data collection has allowed Facebook to gather information about app usage that it could then use to assess competition. It was reported earlier this year that Onavo data helped Facebook come to its decision to purchase WhatsApp and to clone a group video chat app.The documents included a Facebook “industry update” presentation from 2013, which used Onavo data to measure US iPhone app reach, comparing Facebook with competitors.Facebook’s statement said: “We’ve always been clear when people download Onavo about the information that is collected and how it is used, including by Facebook.”While Facebook has sought to reduce data access of some competitors, in some cases the social network has given “special” access to tech platforms it “whitelisted”, the documents show.Most notably, Airbnb, Lyft and Netflix all had arrangements with Facebook.“We will be whitelisted for getting all friends, not just connected friends,” Netflix wrote to Facebook summarizing its data access.Facebook has noted that it eventually changed its policy to further restrict data access.One document signaled Zuckerberg’s level of involvement in making decisions about competitors and data access. It said, “We maintain a small list of strategic competitors that Mark personally reviewed. Apps produced by the companies on this list are subject to a number of restrictions outlined below. Any usage beyond that specified is not permitted without Mark level sign-off.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb058b4c84b60a1947ab2b4e1f4b9e57f7a8fa59/0_232_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=947395587c347ddc8592c14028d2ed40","title":"share your experiences of lost footpaths","story":"More than 10,000 miles of footpath are estimated to have been lost from maps.

Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

A study suggested that drivers in the capital spent an average of 33 hours in traffic jams in 2016.While the country as a whole has 600,000 inhabitants, nearly 200,000 people living in France, Belgium and Germany cross the border every day to work in Luxembourg.Luxembourg has increasingly shown a progressive attitude to transport. This summer, the government brought in free transport for every child and young person under the age of 20. Secondary school students can use free shuttles between their institution and their home. Commuters need only pay €2 (£1.78) for up to two hours of travel, which in a country of just 999 sq miles (2,590 sq km) covers almost all journeys.Now, from the start of 2020 all tickets will be abolished, saving on the collection of fares and the policing of ticket purchases.The policy is yet to be fully thought through, however. A decision has yet to be taken on what to do about first- and second-class compartments on trains.Bettel only just scraped back into government in the recent election. Opinion polls before October’s poll had indicated that the Christian Social People’s party (CSV) – led for 19 years by the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker – would end Bettel’s five years as prime minister.The CSV, however, lost seats, while the Greens gained three seats. The result gave the coalition 31 seats in the 60-seat chamber.The policy of the new government that has caused the most debate, however, has been that of legalising the purchase, possession and consumption of cannabis for recreational use."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/693f097fd6b2b861fe0a0912420ae4ab8f822de9/0_180_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5a0c22f986dd97b6b8f6f5f049bfcce","title":"climate change made uk heatwave 30 times more likely met office","story":"Global warming is harming people’s lives and humanity will not be able to cope, say scientistsThe sweltering heat that hit the UK this summer was made 30 times more likely by human-caused climate change, a Met Office analysis has found.Scientists said the research showed global warming was already harming people’s lives and was not only a future threat.Without rapid cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, such heatwaves would happen every other year by mid-century, the Met Office said. Its analysis showed the average UK temperature during June, July and August was more than 2C above pre-industrial levels.Hundreds more early deaths than usual occurred at the height of the heatwave, while farmers struggled for water and hay and thousands of houses suffered subsidence.The research was launched at the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, and the Met Office’s Prof Richard Betts, who led the work, said: “World leaders should be listening not just to scientists but also to the people who are being affected by extreme weather events right now. They are seeing it with their own eyes and suffering from it. Humanity just won’t be able to cope with the world we are heading for.”Betts said scientists were making links across the world between extreme weather events and climate change, from heatwaves in Japan to wildfires in California: “We’re seeing it happen again and again across the world. This whole sequence of events would not have happened without climate change.”Prof Mark Maslin, at University College London, said: “The analysis clearly shows climate change has already changed our weather patterns and is having adverse effects on people’s lives. It is beholden on all governments to take heed of these warnings and start cutting carbon emissions as quick as possible.”John Sauven, an executive director at Greenpeace UK, said: “The link between climate change and extreme weather used to be a fingerprint, it now looks more like a smoking gun. The science is leaving world leaders nowhere to hide. They are the first generation of political leaders with a clear view of the precipice we’re heading towards and may be the last to be able to swerve away from it.”The heatwave showed the vulnerability of farming and food security to global warming, said Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers Union. “Our industry is on the forefront of climate change impacts. The summer heatwave was hugely challenging and should be a wake-up call for us all.” She said long-term drought policies were needed, such as making it easier to get planning permission for new reservoirs.The Met Office analysis used sophisticated computer models to estimate the probability of such a hot summer in the UK in a world with manmade global warming and in a world without it. If humanity’s fossil fuel burning had not more than doubled the CO2 in the atmosphere, there would have been a less than one in 200 chance of the 2018 heat. But in today’s warming world, the probability was one in eight.The 30-fold increased risk surprised Betts: “It is a large number, but we checked it very carefully.” The methodology used has been peer-reviewed and the new analysis would be, too, but the Met Office said it was important to make the information public as early as possible.Bett’s team also looked at the Central England temperature record which stretches back to 1659. They found just one summer, 1826, as hot as 2018 in the two centuries up until 1850, when CO2 emissions began to rise fast. In contrast, there have been two other summers just as hot as 2018 in the last two decades, in 2003 and 2006.An earlier analysis of the summer heat in Europe also found that climate change had increased its risk, though it looked at the hottest three-day periods, not the whole season. Scores of extreme weather events around the world, including droughts and severe rainfalls, have been linked to global warming, including the Storm Desmond downpour that caused extensive severe flooding in the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fc7a4d7318b6073686a3fdd3a44381ade9c8cb0/0_232_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb2e254e485c9feed7eda32ca93e1604","title":"north korea secret missile site upgrades satellite images","story":"Work continues on upgrading long-range missile sites, months after Kim Jong-un met Donald Trump to talk denuclearisationNorth Korea has significantly expanded and upgraded long-range missile sites, according to satellite images published by CNN, highlighting the lack of progress in negotiations with the US in the months since Kim Jong-un met Donald Trump.The images showed upgrades at the North’s Yeongjeo-dong and revealed another site that was previously not publicly known, both in the country’s mountainous interior. The location of the missile bases means it is likely to be a launch site for North Korea’s newest long-range missiles, including ones that can carry nuclear warheads, according to analysts who reviewed the images for CNN. It includes a network of underground tunnels used for storing missiles.The US defence department said in a statement: “We watch North Korea very closely but we cannot discuss intelligence.”Trump and Kim agreed to work toward the “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula” during a meeting in Singapore in June, and Kim has since offered to close some missile testing facilities. North Korea in May claimed to dismantle its only known nuclear test site, sealing tunnels in front of a handful of journalists.Despite punishing economic sanctions and a flurry of diplomacy over the past year, Pyongyang has not agreed to curtail its nuclear weapons program or halt development of missiles.In recent months North Korea has announced the testing of an unspecified “newly developed ultramodern weapon” and reports have repeatedly revealed it is continuing to develop its nuclear and missiles programs.Trump said on Saturday he hoped to hold a second meeting with Kim early next year and US national security adviser John Bolton said the lack of progress with North Korea made a second summit necessary, likely to be held in January or February.US officials have insisted North Korea must fully disarm and open itself to international inspectors before it will grant sanctions relief while North Korea’s state media has called the stance a “hostile policy” and said the US “is responding to good faith with evil”."},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

Photograph: Andy RainEPATheresa May is considering offering a formal guarantee to MPs that they will be given a vote before Britain enters the Northern Ireland backstop in an attempt to win support for her Brexit deal next week. But Downing Street stressed on Wednesday that the prime minister will not seek any change to the withdrawal agreement, which does not allow Britain to leave the backstop unilaterally.Mrs May met Conservative backbenchers in her office at the House of Commons on Wednesday after she promised to listen to their concerns about the backstop. The Brexit deal allows Britain to choose by July 2020 whether to extend the transition period for a year or two from December 2020. After such an extension, the backstop would automatically come into effect if no other solution had been found to keep the Border open. Among the options under discussion at Westminster is amending the motion on the Brexit deal to include a “parliamentary lock” that would assert that MPs could choose to reject triggering the backstop. This would be consistent with the British constitutional doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty but it would mean breaching an international treaty, with all the consequences that entails.Steve Baker, a leading Conservative Brexiteer, said the idea was falling flat among Eurosceptics. “Who is going to fall for that? The treaty would be binding,” he said.Brexiteers described as devastating the attorney general’s legal advice on the Brexit deal, which the government published on Wednesday after MPs voted that it was in contempt of parliament. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds pointed to its assertion that under the backstop, Northern Ireland would have to treat Great Britain as a “third country” for goods.The prime minister’s official spokesman said the legal advice published on Wednesday was consistent with everything the government had said publicly about what the backstop meant for Northern Ireland. Jacob Rees-Mogg told his European Research Group (ERG) of Conservative Brexiteers that Mr Dodds had promised him that the DUP would support the government in a confidence vote if Mrs May’s deal is defeated next week. Mr Rees-Mogg suggested that the DUP’s support could be in doubt if the prime minister’s deal was approved but other DUP sources told The  that the party is not considering voting against the government in a confidence motion regardless of the outcome of next week’s vote.International development secretary Liam Fox warned on Wednesday that if the prime minister’s Brexit deal is rejected next week, MPs could seek to keep Britain inside the EU.“I think there is a real danger, given the House of Commons which has a Remain majority, may attempt to steal Brexit from the British people, which I think would be a democratic affront,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

coalition spreads confusion vaccinations sacking commission","story":"Since coming to power in June, Italy\u0026#39s coalition has sown confusion over its policy on vaccinesItaly’s populist coalition has plunged its already confusing stance on vaccines into greater uncertainty by sacking a commission of health experts.The decision was announced by Giulia Grillo, the health minister, who said it was “time to make room” for new people on the commission, which governments normally turn to for health advice.“We are the government of change,” she said. “I have chosen to open the door to other deserving personalities.”But it was not clear who the replacements might be.The government, which is made up of the hard-Right League and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, has sent out confusing signals about health policies, and in particular the importance of vaccinations, since it came to power in June.Both parties have been accused of peddling conspiracy theories about the supposed risks of having vaccinations.Matteo Salvini, the interior minister and deputy prime minister, has called them “useless and in many cases dangerous,” playing on discredited claims that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab can cause autism.The sacking of the health commission was met with consternation by health experts and criticism from opposition parties.Italy already has one of the worst records on measles cases and deaths from superbug infections in Europe. Both the Five Star Movement, led by Luigi di Maio (L) and The League, led by Matteo Salvini, have expressed scepticism over the need for vaccinationsRoberta Siliquini, the outgoing president of the commission, said: “Given the quality of the members that make up the council, I don\u0027t see any scientific reason for the decision.”Dr Siliquini, who is the head of the school of hygiene and preventive medicine at Turin University, said she had never met the minister since the government was appointed in June.Like the other members of the commission, Dr Siliquini was appointed last December by the previous, centre-Left government.Their term was supposed to have lasted for three years.“It’s a decision that leaves us frankly astounded,” said Maria Rizzotti, an MP with the centre-Right Forza Italia party.“We have no idea why the minister removed, two years early, the members who were appointed to the commission in December 2017.The decision appeared to be a “political purge”, she said. “An advisory body as important as the Higher Health Council must not be deprived of experts of the highest level,” she said.Vasco Errani, from the centre-Left party Free and Equal, said it was “incomprehensible” that the minister had never met the commission’s experts and accused the coalition of operating a “spoils system” of politically-motivated appointments.The government has said that vaccinations should be voluntary, not obligatory, despite the risk of infectious diseases spreading, particularly among children in schools and nurseries.The number of measles cases has risen dramatically in ItalyBut to add confusion to the government’s stance, Ms Grillo admitted during the summer, when she was pregnant, that she would definitely have her baby vaccinated.She said that parents should be allowed to “self-certify” that their children have had the required jabs at the start of the academic year in September, rather than be required to produce doctors’ notes.The commission of experts recommended just last month that 800,000 children and young adults should be vaccinated against measles amid what it called an “emergency” over the rising number of cases.At the time Ms Grillo, the minister, appeared to endorse that call.Rising scepticism over the need for vaccinations has resulted in a sharp rise in the number of measles cases in Italy, from around 850 in 2016 to 5,000 cases last year.Please review our commenting policyMay under fire over £50,000 ads on social media to promote

satellite images reveal north korea expanding key missile","story":"Image provided by the North Korean government in 2017, shows what the North Korean government calls the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile, at an undisclosed location in North KoreaNew satellite images have revealed that North Korea has significantly expanded a key long-range missile base located in a remote mountainous area, despite ongoing talks this year with the US over the country’s nuclear disarmament. The images, obtained by CNN, offers evidence that the Yeongjeo-dong missile base and a nearby, previously unreported, site remain active and have been continually upgraded, highlighting the continuing gulf between Pyongyang and Washington’s views on denuclearisation. Yeongjeo-dong has long been known to US intelligence agencies but researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey told CNN that the construction on a new facility, at Hoejung-ri, seven miles away, had not previously been publicly identified. “Construction on the previously unidentified site has continued even after the Singapore Summit” between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, the US president, in June, said the Institute’s Jeffrey Lewis. “Whatever Kim says about his desire for denuclearisation, North Korea continues to produce and deploy nuclear armed missiles,” he added. Frustration has been building between the US and North Korea since the historic June Singapore summitThe bases are believed to serve as shelters for mobile missile launchers, and would be able to store the country’s newest long-range missiles, including those capable of carrying nuclear warheads. The North officially suspended its nuclear and missile tests ahead of the June summit, and missile production and deployment does not technically violate any agreement between Pyongyang and the US and South Korea. However, ongoing activity at the sites feeds into US criticisms that North Korea is now dragging its heels over the denuclearisation process. John Bolton, the US national security adviser, told the Wall Street Journal earlier this week that President Trump believes he should hold a second summit with Kim early next year as the North Koreans “have not lived up to the commitments” of their first deal in June. The Singapore summit, while historic in terms of who came to the table, produced a vaguely worded agreement to “build a lasting and stable peace regime” and for North Korea to “work toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.”Several analysts, who have long argued that the US has raised unrealistic expectations on disarmament, expressed little surprise at the new satellite images. “North Korea isn’t disarming. It never said it would. Bolton cares that it isn’t. But here’s the twist: Trump doesn’t. He has to be well aware of these developments. He just doesn’t care. Kim pretends to disarm and Trump pretends to believe him,” tweeted Vipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at MIT. Simmering tensions between Pyongyang and Washington do not appear to have stymied backroom talks, however. Andrew Kim, the head of the CIA’s Korean Mission Centre, reportedly met with senior unnamed North Korean officials in the border village of Panmunjom on Monday.“North Korea and the US appear to be making headway,” a high-ranking South Korean government source told the Hankyoreh paper. Details of the talks have not been disclosed. However, Pyongyang has recently also shown frustration with Washington for refusing to meet its concessions. On Wednesday, the country’s state-run Korean Central News Agency called for the complete suspension of South Korean-US military drills in order to build a permanent and strong peace regime. In an interview with Radio Free Asia, Thae Yong-ho, who defected from the North while serving as deputy ambassador to the UK, said that Pyongyang would never agree to end its weapons programme through a “complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation” process. But he cautioned the US not to walk away from the table. “If that happens, North Korea will say this to the world: ‘We sincerely tried for nuclear removal and were ready to accept US requirements, but the US insisted on unreasonable conditions’,” he said.   Please review our commenting policyMay under fire over £50,000 ads on social media to promote Brexit dealCity children four times more lonely than those in countryside, finds studyBrexiteer Michael Gove given final say in bid to win over MPs to dealComment: Remainers think they can cancel Brexit, but it can only be delayedBrexit latest news: Economy to dominate day three of debate as whips seek to bolster May supportNicola Sturgeon \u0026#39must stop lecturing and start listening to Scots on Brexit\u0026#39Comment: The Conservatives must get rid of Theresa May to fix this messAlleged attacker of Syrian schoolboy \u0026#39scared for his life\u0026#39UK\u0026#39s summer heatwave \u0026#3930 times more likely\u0026#39 because of climate change\u0026#39Snobbish\u0026#39 Britons think university is the only way to get a good job, says Education Secretary Mentally ill patients being treated like criminals, head of review warns Women should be offered DIY cervical cancer testing kits, study saysInfant milk allergy rate soars as investigation finds senior child doctors have extensive industry linksTheresa May gives Michael Gove chance to have final say in Brexit debateNorth Korea: Life Inside the Secret State, review: simple animations underpin pessimistic documentary about North Korean lifeBrexit latest news: EU prepared to offer Theresa May lifeline by extending Article 50Death and Nightingales, episode 2 review: this slow-moving drama might have worked better as a single episodeJeremy Corbyn ‘misses open goal’ with no mention of Brexit at PMQs      Comment: If MPs reject May\u0026#39s Brexit deal we will have the time and space to think againWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 6 december 2018","story":"The British Museum press launch of their Manga exhibition, which opens 23 May 2019.

If we stay on the current course, we know the kind of world we\u0027re heading towards: more floods, heatwaves, droughts, and rising sea levels.He said the window of opportunity to avoid dangerous climate change was still open, but only just, and called on political leaders to take action, including replacing fossil fuels with renewables, cutting emissions from homes and cars, and halting destruction of the rainforests.May under fire over £50,000 ads on social media to promote Brexit dealCity children four times more lonely than those in countryside, finds studyBrexiteer Michael Gove given final say in bid to win over MPs to dealComment: Remainers think they can cancel Brexit, but it can only be delayedBrexit latest news: Economy to dominate day three of debate as whips seek to bolster May supportNicola Sturgeon \u0026#39must stop lecturing and start listening to Scots on Brexit\u0026#39Comment: The Conservatives must get rid of Theresa May to fix this messAlleged attacker of Syrian schoolboy \u0026#39scared for his life\u0026#39\u0026#39Snobbish\u0026#39 Britons think university is the only way to get a good job, says Education Secretary Mentally ill patients being treated like criminals, head of review warns Women should be offered DIY cervical cancer testing kits, study saysInfant milk allergy rate soars as investigation finds senior child doctors have extensive industry linksTheresa May gives Michael Gove chance to have final say in Brexit debateNorth Korea: Life Inside the Secret State, review: simple animations underpin pessimistic documentary about North Korean lifeBrexit latest news: EU prepared to offer Theresa May lifeline by extending Article 50Death and Nightingales, episode 2 review: this slow-moving drama might have worked better as a single episodeJeremy Corbyn ‘misses open goal’ with no mention of Brexit at PMQs      Comment: If MPs reject May\u0026#39s Brexit deal we will have the time and space to think againWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/03/08/geoffrey-cox-legal-advice.jpg","title":"pound rises against dollar euro brexit remain chances increase","story":"IM Subscribe  registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Wait until we actually leaveMeanwhile, a volley of tweets from Donald Trump punctured the optimism in markets that had followed news of a truce between the US and China.Just days after talks between the world’s two economic superpowers the US president once again fired off warning shots over trade,\u0026nbsptweeting: “We are either going to have a REAL DEAL with China, or no deal at all - at which point we will be charging major Tariffs against Chinese product being shipped into the United States.\u0026nbsp“Ultimately, I believe, we will be making a deal - either now or into the future…”The president’s words helped to put downward pressure on the dollar as scepticism grew that Bejing and Washington would agree terms within the agreed 90-day window.Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM\u0026nbspsaid: “The tremors created from President Trump’s Twitter outbursts continue to illustrate how financial markets remain extremely sensitive to trade-related newsflow.“Although the Trump Administration has repeatedly blamed the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy tightening for the unfavourable investor mood in stocks, the key culprit behind the selloff witnessed yesterday was clearly the comment made by Trump on trade with China.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It sets off Saturday, 8 December, and is expected to drop onto the Moon early next year.It will head up towards the Moon, fly around it and then drop down, into a specially selected region of the Moon that will become its home.Once there, it will look to learn a whole host of things about that nearby but still largely mysterious world. It will measure the surface temperature, examine the chemicals that make up its soil, as well as looking up at the Sun.But the mission is possible because it relies not only on the lander that will touch down on the Moon. It is also made up of a set of other hardware – chief among them the\u0026nbspQueqiao satellite, which will serve as a bridge and relay information between the lander on the far side of the Moon and its engineers down on Earth.Just as with the world it will explore, much of the mission remains murky and unknown. The Chinese space agency has stayed largely quiet about details of what will happen, including where exactly on the Moon it will arrive.Its mission comes amid a new focus on the Moon – particularly as an important stepping stone on the way to other missions, deeper into the solar system. Nasa, for instance, has spoken about how keen it is to send humans back there, with the aim of eventually using it as a base for journeys to Mars.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Equally, I want T-level students, that want to, to be able to go to university to do relevant technical degrees.”Mr Hinds will announce the next seven T-level courses to be taught from 2021,\u0026nbspwhich will include programmes in health, science, construction, and digital services.The first T-level courses will be taught in further education and post-16 providers from 2020.Speaking at an event in London this morning, Mr Hinds will add: “As a nation I’m afraid we’ve been technical education snobs. We’ve revered the academic but treated vocational as second class. When we do it well -\u0026nbsplaw, engineering, medicine -\u0026nbspthen we don’t even call it vocational.“Why has this has been tolerated for so long? I think the reason is the “OPC” problem. For so many opinion formers, commentators and, yes, politicians: vocational courses are for ‘other people’s children’.”Tom Berwick, chief executive of the Federation of Awarding Bodies (FAB), who has previously raised concerns about the implementation of the T-levels, said: “The principle of a genuinely world-class and equitable technical route for young people will be broadly welcomed.”He added: “However, the elephant in the room is securing proper investment in further education which has seen its funding cut significantly in the last decade.“The government needs a more coherent plan post-18 that links increased investment in productivity with better incentives for providers and employers to meet the skills the country needs.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Demonstrators for and against Brexit protest opposite the Houses of ParliamentTheresa May has suffered an unprecedented defeat after the government was found to be in contempt of parliament for refusing to publish key Brexit papers.The Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivering to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.

Zuckerberg agreed to senior executive Justin\u0026nbspOsofsky’s request in 2013 to stop giving friends’ list access to Vine on the day that social media rival Twitter launched the video-sharing service. “We’ve prepared reactive PR,” Mr\u0026nbspOsofsky\u0026nbspwrote, to which Mr Zuckerberg replied: “Yup, go for it.”The documents also raised questions about Facebook’s transparency. An exchange from 2015 shows Facebook leaders discussing how to begin collecting call logs from Android users’ smartphones without subjecting them to “scary” permissions screens.In a summary of the 250-page cache, which includes internal emails involving Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and other members of staff,\u0026nbspDamian\u0026nbspCollins MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, highlighted a number of “key issues”.Sandberg asked staff to probe Soros after his attack on tech companiesHe claimed the documents show Facebook chose to “whitelist” selected companies, allowing them to maintain “full access” to the data of a user’s Facebook friends even after the company announced changes in 2015 to end such access.Mr Collins suggested the cache also showed Facebook regularly discussed the value of data on the platform, and said: “The idea of linking access to friends’ data to the financial value of the developers’ relationship with Facebook is a recurring feature of the documents.”He added that the files also showed Facebook knew an update to its Android mobile app that would allow it to collect user call logs would be controversial and “to mitigate any bad PR Facebook planned to make it as hard as possible for users to know that this was one of the underlying features of the upgrade of their app”.Created with Sketch.How to stop Facebook from revealing everything about you Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.19 Lock your profile downIf you haven’t done this already, do it now.

It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 79 Clean up your appsYou can view a list of all of the apps you’ve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps.

The summary said the site used this data to assess how often people use these apps and then to decide on which companies to acquire and which to treat as a threat.The internal workings of Facebook were revealed after parliament released the internal documents from the controversial company. The files show a range of discussions from inside Facebook, including suggestions that it could one day charge developers for access to its data about users.\u0026nbsp“There’s a big question on where we get the revenue from,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in one email. “Do we make it easy for devs to use our paymentsad network but not require them? Do we require them? Do we just charge a rev share directly and let devs who use them get a credit against what they owe us? It’s not at all clear to me here that we have a model that will actually make us the revenue we want at scale.”\u0026nbspThe documents were released as the company is hit by a range of scandals about how Facebook uses the vast array of personal data it collects about its users.Facebook users logged out as site stops working properlyThe documents were released by parliament’s media committee, which is running an investigation into those scandals and Facebook more generally, and are files seized from a now-defunct swimsuit photo searching app as part of that investigation. They show that Facebook deeply considered the issues that would go on to produce a range of scandals, including the Cambridge\u0026nbspAnalytica\u0026nbspaffair.The committee received the documents from app developer\u0026nbspSix4Three, which had acquired the files dating from 2013-2014, as part of a US lawsuit against the social media giant. The app developer is suing Facebook over a change to the social network’s privacy policies in 2015 that led\u0026nbspSix4Three\u0026nbspto shut down its app,\u0026nbspPikinis, which let users find photos of their friends in bathing suits by searching their friends list.\u0026nbspUS senator Richard\u0026nbspBlumenthal\u0026nbspdescribed the documents as part of “mounting evidence that Facebook acted chaotically, recklessly and lawlessly by granting access to private consumer data for financial gain”.Facebook responded quickly, saying the release was misleading. “The documents\u0026nbspSix4Three\u0026nbspgathered for their baseless case are only part of the story and are presented in a way that is very misleading without additional context,” the statement said. “We stand by the platform changes we made in 2015 to stop a person from sharing their friends’ data with developers.“Like any business, we had many internal conversations about the various ways we could build a sustainable business model for our platform. But the facts are clear: we’ve never sold people’s data.”The firm said it would relax one “out of date” policy that restricted competitors’ use of its data. Previously, “Mark level signoff” would have been required for an exemption to the policy, according to one document, referring to Mr Zuckerberg.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Because of that, Netflix is said to have paid $100m to keep the sitcom having initially been paying $30m a year.According to The New York Times, this new fee “reflects the thirst for content in the streaming age”. The report also states that Netflix pre-empted user outcry and began negotiations to keep the sitcom – which ran from 1994-2004 – months ago.Does this mean that Netflix’s library of classic shows will be reduced as newer streaming services arrive? It certainly seems so. Look no further than the recent cancellations of its Marvel shows, including Daredevil and Luke Cage, which is said to be a casualty of Disney’s forthcoming streamer, Disney+. It will host original shows featuring characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe and its Star Wars franchise.Despite this, it’s not just old films and TV shows that get watched by Netflix users with chief content officer Ted Sarandos confirming that new film The Christmas Chronicles was watched 20 million times in its first week, marking what he believes to be a career first for lead star Kurt Russell.Friends arrived on Netflix UK in January 2018, three years after making its debut on Netflix US.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Huawei has a robust cyber security assurance system and a proven track record.Additional reporting by ReutersShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Apple has often held out on such upgrades initially, waiting until they are improved and perfected.iPhone X could come back after weak sales of new Apple phonesLike 3G and 4G before it, 5G is expected to offer a vast increase in speed and reliability. But it is also talked about in much more enthusiastic terms: it will be faster even than internet connections delivered over WiFi, and might improve connectivity in such a way as to fundamentally change the ways that phones work.Such upgrades have previously come with weak coverage and poor performance, putting customers off the new technology. 5G\u0027s proponents argue that the speed increase that arrives with the new technology will be worth such teething problems.Those backing 5G claim that it will fundamentally change how networks and communications are organised. Networks will be so much faster than WiFi that they could make the wireless technology useless, for instance, and data transfer will be so fast that it will allow people to have internet\u0026nbspconnections to places across the world.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But, argue\u0026nbspJohn Curtice\u0026nbspand his co-authors in a new book edited by Philip Cowley and Denis Kavanagh, the real Brexit referendum actually happened a year laterClick to followThe IndependentThe social geography of the 2017 general election was shaped by attitudes towards BrexitIf voters agreed with the prime minister that the 2017 general election was about Brexit, then – given that her vision of Britain’s future relationship with the EU was widely regarded as representing a “hard” Brexit (prioritising control of immigration over continued membership of the EU single market) – we might expect her party to have advanced more strongly in places where the previous year a relatively high proportion had voted to leave the EU.Our analysis suggests this is precisely what happened. The higher the estimated vote for Leave in 2016, the more the Conservative vote increased, while support for the party actually fell back on average in places where Leave failed to secure at least 45 per cent of the vote.\u0026nbspThe link between Labour’s performance and the strength of the Leave vote in 2016 is much weaker, a finding that might be thought to reflect the party’s relatively ambiguous position on Brexit.How Europe became the funeral pyre for Tory leadersThere was only a three-point difference between the increase in the Labour vote in places where 60 per cent or more voted to Leave and the equivalent figure for constituencies where less than 45 per cent voted to Leave – far less than the corresponding difference of 12 points in the Conservative performance.Even so, between them these two patterns are sufficiently strong that in seats where more than 60 per cent voted to Leave, there was on average a net (total vote) swing of 0.8 per cent from Labour to the Conservatives, even though everywhere else in England and Wales Labour’s vote increased more than that of the Conservatives.Where did the Ukip vote go?A key reason why the link between the Conservative performance and the strength of the Leave vote is much stronger than that for Labour lies in the impact on the two parties’ performances of the collapse in the Ukip vote.Ukip’s share of the vote in the 2015 election was much larger in areas where Leave did well in the referendum. The decline in Ukip support two years later was almost invariably greatest where the party had previously been strongest. If those who voted Ukip in 2015 (nearly all of whom voted to Leave in 2016) were now particularly inclined to switch to the Conservatives, this could have served to boost the Conservative performance in constituencies that voted heavily to Leave.Indeed, while Labour\u0026nbspappears to have won some of the voters that Ukip lost, the Conservatives apparently gained many more.Ukip in 2017 was almost invariably greatest in areas where the party had been strongest before (Getty)Nevertheless, the collapse in Ukip support is far from being the whole explanation for the strong Conservative performance in areas keenest on leaving the EU. Even when we take into account how heavily Ukip support fell, the Conservatives still performed better where the Leave vote was stronger in 2016.Where did Remain and Leave voters go? The Conservative Party did not do well in places where Leave was strong in 2016 only because of the pattern of switching among\u0026nbspformer Ukip voters rather, Leave voters more generally seem to have been drawn into voting Conservative at this election, while Remain voters tilted towards Labour.Support for Ukip in 2015 and for Leave in 2016 varied substantially by age and educational background. Both were particularly popular with older people and those with few or no formal educational qualifications, while younger people and graduates tended to shun Ukip and vote Remain.

There is a corresponding, though much weaker tendency in the opposite direction for Labour. At the same time, the Conservatives performed less well and Labour better in seats with more young adults – though once we take this into account, there is no indication, despite the prominence given to Labour’s manifesto promise to scrap tuition fees for students at English universities, that constituencies with large numbers of students were particularly likely to swing towards the party.The social geography of Conservative and Labour performance at this election was primarily, albeit not entirely, a consequence of the role played by attitudes towards Brexit in shaping how people voted.What about the economy?Traditionally, the state of the economy has played a central role in how people vote. In 2015, for example, the Conservatives clearly performed worse where unemployment was highest or had increased most, and where household incomes were relatively low. At this election, however, if anything the opposite was the case.Revolutionary study into voter \u0027clans\u0027 holds key to 2022 electionThe worse local economic circumstances were, the better the Conservatives did and the worse Labour did. For instance, Conservative support increased on average by 5.8 points where the constituency unemployment rate increased between 2015 and 2017, compared with 4.9 points where it fell. The equivalent figures for Labour were 9.8 points and 10.4 points respectively. Moreover, despite a continued squeeze on public spending and a promise from the Conservatives of more austerity to come that could mean cuts in public sector jobs, there was, in contrast to 2015, no particular relationship between Conservative or Labour performance and the local prevalence of public sector employees.Did the antisemitism row hurt Labour?Not that the focus on Brexit meant that nothing else mattered. Jeremy Corbyn’s views on the Middle East have attracted particular controversy, with critics accusing the Labour leader of being too sympathetic to iniduals and groups opposed to Israel, including some widely regarded as extremist. There were related accusations that, under Corbyn’s leadership, the Labour Party had dealt inadequately with allegations that some party members have made antisemitic statements. These issues appear to have made a difference. On average Labour’s vote increased by 11.6 points in constituencies where more than 4 per cent are Muslim, compared with an average increase of 9.6 points elsewhere in England and Wales. This difference is not accounted for by the tendency of the Leave vote to be lower in seats with more Muslims. Meanwhile, and by contrast, the Labour vote only rose by 8.8 points on average across the 10 constituencies with the largest Jewish populations, even though seven of these 10 seats are in London, where Labour generally performed relatively well.Did social class drive the voting?However, the fallout from the EU referendum was most important in shaping the geography of Conservative and Labour performance. In so doing, the contest served to reduce some of the traditional isions in British elections. For example, although working-class voters had traditionally been the bedrock of Labour support, they had also been more likely to vote Leave and to vote for Ukip. Thus, thanks to its gains among such voters, at this election Conservative support increased by as much as 9.4 points in seats where more than 13 per cent are engaged in a routine manual occupation, compared with just 1.3 points where fewer than 10 per cent have a routine job. Conversely, Labour’s support increased by just 9.1 points in relatively working-class seats, but by 10.7 points where relatively few have a routine job.\u0026nbspWhat happened to the northsouth ide?Equally, the northsouth ide in Britain’s electoral geography also narrowed somewhat, the first time it has done so since 1997. A relatively weak Conservative performance and a relatively strong Labour performance across the largely more pro-Remain south of England\u0026nbspmeant that on average there was as much as a 3.9 point swing from Conservative to Labour there.In contrast, the swing to Labour was only 1.3 in the north of England and 0.7\u0026nbspin the heavily pro-Leave Midlands. One striking consequence of this ergence is that Conservative support is now higher in the Midlands than in the south of England, not least, but also not solely, because pro-Remain and ethnically erse London has now become something of a Labour citadel.Paxman returned to Newsnight to interrogate May and Corbyn (Getty)Despite initial appearances, therefore, this clearly was not an election that heralded a return to the familiar patterns of two-party politics.Do constituency boundaries hold the key?But what about the notion that the makeup of parliament is as much to do with the way constituency boundaries have been drawn as anything else? That question is particularly topical, given current proposals for boundary reform. \u0026nbspThe present constituency boundaries are biased against the Conservatives, but this is compensated for by the more efficient distribution of their vote.Surprising though the failure of the Conservatives to win an overall majority last year might have seemed, was the tally of seats won by each party significantly different from what we might have anticipated given the shares of the vote each of them secured?\u0026nbspThe traditional way of addressing this question has been to compare the actual outcome in seats with what would have happened if in every constituency each party’s share of the vote had increased or fallen in line with the change in its overall share of the vote across Britain as a whole – that is, uniform change.However, applying this method becomes difficult when, as happened in 2015 and again in 2017, there is a substantial change in the level of support for a party, such as the SNP, that only fights elections in one part of the country but wins plenty of seats there. In these circumstances the change in that party’s share of the Britain-wide vote will inevitably be but a pale reflection of the actual rise or fall in its support in the part of the UK where it stood.It is therefore better to use as our initial benchmark what would have happened if support for all of the main Britain-wide parties had increased or fallen in every constituency in England and Wales in line with the overall change in their support in those two parts of the UK combined. For each seat in Scotland, meanwhile, we calculate what would have happened if the rise or fall in each party’s support had been in line with the change in its share of the Scotland-wide total.On the basis of these assumptions, the Conservatives would have won 323 seats (instead of 318), Labour 259 (262), the SNP 37 (35), the Liberal Democrat nine (12), Plaid Cymru three (four) and the Greens one (one), while, of course, there would be 18 other MPs from Northern Ireland. None of these figures are\u0026nbspvery different from what actually transpired and, above all, the Conservatives would still have failed to secure an overall majority – albeit they would have been only three rather than eight seats short.What about Scotland?That projected Conservative tally includes 11 seats in Scotland. However, if the increase in the Conservative vote north of the border had been in line with the lower increase in England and Wales – and the fall in SNP support had not happened – the Conservatives would have won only two Scottish seats. Thus, in the absence of the distinctive outcome in Scotland, the Conservatives would have won only 314 seats. To that extent, the distinctive result in Scotland proved to be crucial to the arithmetic of the new House of Commons.SNP only fights elections in one part of the country but wins plenty of seats there (Getty)What were the other factors?However, although the overall tally of seats for each party was more or less in line with what might have been expected given the changes in their overall shares of the vote, there were lots of seats where the outcome was at variance with what would have happened if the movements in party support had been the same everywhere.What if Nick Clegg had gone into coalition with Labour in 2010?No fewer than 36 seats changed hands that would not have done so under those circumstances, while 16 constituencies were held against the tide. Most of these outcomes can in fact be accounted for by one or other of the systematic patterns of variation our analysis has identified, including the tendency for the Conservatives to perform better in seats with a relatively large Leave vote and Labour to do likewise in seats where Remain polled relatively well, the Conservatives’ ability on occasion to squeeze the other unionist parties in Scotland, and the willingness of some of those who might otherwise have voted Labour to make a tactical switch to the (pro-Remain) Liberal Democrats. In short, much of the significant variation in party performance was linked in some way or other to the fallout from either the 2016 EU referendum or the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.Dem leader Tim Farron narrowly retained his seat with 8.4 per cent swing to the Tories (Getty)This still leaves us with the observation that for the third time in a row, the electoral system failed to deliver the winning party a substantial overall majority (and, indeed, on two occasions any majority at all).The system’s ability to generate safe overall majorities has long been regarded as a hallmark of the single member plurality system (often referred to as “first past the post”) and the resulting clarity of the link between the outcome of an election and who forms the government is often cited as a major justification for its continued use.It might be thought the explanation is that, at 2.5 points, the Conservative lead over Labour in terms of votes across Great Britain as a whole was a relatively narrow one. It was certainly much narrower than the seven point leads that the Conservatives enjoyed in 2010 and 2015. Yet it was larger than the leads (in Great Britain) that the Conservatives enjoyed in 1955 (1.9 points) and 1970 (2.3 points) or Labour did in 1964 (1.9 points), yet those three contests all resulted in an overall majority, including in two instances a relatively safe one.Historical precedent apparently suggests that the Conservative lead should have been sufficient to give the party an overall majority.What about variable constituency sizes?One consequence of the prime minister’s decision to secure a Commons vote for an early election is that the contest had to be fought on the same constituency boundaries as in 2015 and not on the new boundaries the various parliamentary boundary commissions were in the midst of preparing in readiness for an election in 2020.The resulting inequality in the sizes of constituencies was certainly a disadvantage for the Conservatives. The average electorate in constituencies they won at this election was 74,451, whereas in seats won by Labour it was 70,529. The difference of some 3,920 people was around 520 bigger than it had been two years previously.The gap may have been increased somewhat by the government’s decision in 2015 to speed up the introduction of inidual electoral registration, which resulted in particularly sharp drops in registration in some typically Labour-held constituencies with large numbers of students. But the gap was then narrowed somewhat by the applications to be added to the register many (and especially younger) voters made after its initial compilation in December 2016. These added 2,300 names on average to the register in constituencies that Labour won, compared with just 1,600 on average in seats won by the Conservatives.Did voter turnout make a difference?However, inequalities in the registered electorate are not the only consideration that we have to bear in mind in considering the sizes of constituencies. Bias might also arise if turnout is lower in seats held by one party than it is in those won by its opponents. Indeed, turnout was on average some four points lower on average in seats won by Labour at this election (66.5 per cent) than it was in those won by the Conservatives (70.7 per cent).\u0026nbspAFPGetty)That said, this was a noticeably smaller gap than in 2015, for turnout increased on average by 3.8 points in seats Labour won, but by only 2.0 points in those won by the Conservatives. As a result, at 5,675 votes, the difference between Conservative and Labour-held seats in terms of the total number of votes cast was actually smaller at this election than it had been in the same two sets of seats two years previously (6,541).To this we need to add one other consideration. The relative success of the Conservatives in seats with a relatively high Leave vote meant that the increase in the party’s vote was often greater in more working-class seats outside of London and the south of England, whose populations have grown less rapidly and thus tend to have lower than average electorates.For example, Conservative support increased on average by as much as 7.3 points in seats in which fewer than 72,000 people were registered to vote, compared with just 4.3 points where more than 77,000 names appeared on the register. Similarly, while the Conservative vote increased on average by 9.7 points where turnout was less than 65 per cent, it increased by just 3.2 points where turnout was above 71 per cent. As a result, there was a noticeable reduction in the extent to which the Conservative vote was concentrated in constituencies where more people turned out to vote.Created with Sketch.

The Labour Party was ahead of the Conservatives by more than 40 points in 27 per cent of seats that it won, while the Conservative Party was that far ahead of Labour in just 12 per cent of the constituencies that it won.\u0026nbspIn short, whatever disadvantage the Conservatives suffered as a result of inequalities in the sizes of constituencies tended to be compensated by them having a more efficiently distributed vote.John\u0026nbspCurtice, Strathclyde University, Stephen Fisher, Trinity College, Oxford, and Robert Ford and Patrick English, University of Manchester, are authors of The Results Analysed, in ‘The British General Election of 2017’, edited by Philip Cowley and Dennis\u0026nbspKavanagh, from which this article is extractedShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That makes life challenging for us.OnePlus aims to go mainstream as it launches its ‘iPhone killer’“5G is going to open up a lot of new ways people use their smartphone – the increased speed combined with the increased capacity mean your smartphone can now truly be the centre of a connected experience, for everything from fitness to home automation.”The announcement that OnePlus’s\u0026nbspphone will be the first available in Europe comes despite the fact that other manufacturers – including giants like Samsung – have promised to bring their own devices to the network as soon as possible.Asked whether he was concerned that rivals would beat OnePlus to market despite its claim to being the first, Mr Lau said that there are “obviously no guarantees” but that his company were best positioned to be ready with the cutting-edge technology first.“We started working on 5G in 2016, and developed an R\u0026ampD lab with Qualcomm in 2017,” he said. “OnePlus has always used Qualcomm 800 series chipsets as part of our flagship-only strategy, and this is part of the reason for the excellent relationship we have with one of the world’s leading chipset providers.“No-one is better positioned than OnePlus to take the lead with 5G. We don’t really look at what others are doing in the industry, we’re focused on providing the best possible experience for our users, and we recognised early on that 5G would be a huge opportunity for revolution.”Others, such as Apple, are rumoured to have sat out the decision until at least 2020, allowing other companies to take the first leap – and deal with the potential for the kinds of major infrastructure problems that have blighted similar rollouts in the past. Mr Lau said that OnePlus would work hard to ensure those problems didn’t hit this time around.Created with Sketch.iPhone XS launch in September 2018 Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Tim Cook speaks about the iPhone XS and XS MaxTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone XS and XS Max at an Apple Inc product launch event 211 Tim Cook speaking at the iPhone launchTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks on stage at the end of the Apple Inc311 Tim Cook speaking during the event411 Phil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketingPhil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, speaks about the Apple iPhone XS and Apple iPhone XS Max511 Phil Schiller speaks about the new iPhone XRPhilip W.

Those early adopters know that, as with the launch of 4G, there won’t be 5G coverage everywhere at first but it’ll be a rapid rollout from networks.”Proponents have regularly suggested that 5G could change the way that people use phones, allowing people to take advantage of instant and reliable connections to create new forms of experience. Mr\u0026nbspLau\u0026nbspechoed those claims,\u0026nbspsuggesting they may be transformative in ways that the company has not even expected.“When you look at the history of smartphones, they’re used in ways today which no-one had designed them for originally,” he said.\u0026nbsp”5G will be the same – the possibilities will open up in front of us as people experiment with how to combine speed and capacity – everything from gaming through to work or fitness will change.

Wait until we actually leaveMeanwhile, a volley of tweets from Donald Trump punctured the optimism in markets that had followed news of a truce between the US and China.Just days after talks between the world’s two economic superpowers the US president once again fired off warning shots over trade,\u0026nbsptweeting: “We are either going to have a REAL DEAL with China, or no deal at all - at which point we will be charging major Tariffs against Chinese product being shipped into the United States.\u0026nbsp“Ultimately, I believe, we will be making a deal - either now or into the future…”The president’s words helped to put downward pressure on the dollar as scepticism grew that Bejing and Washington would agree terms within the agreed 90-day window.Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM\u0026nbspsaid: “The tremors created from President Trump’s Twitter outbursts continue to illustrate how financial markets remain extremely sensitive to trade-related newsflow.“Although the Trump Administration has repeatedly blamed the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy tightening for the unfavourable investor mood in stocks, the key culprit behind the selloff witnessed yesterday was clearly the comment made by Trump on trade with China.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That means in effect that it would be the inversion of normal mass: if you pushed it, it would be propelled towards you.We know even less about dark matter than we thought, scientists findThe implications of such a breakthrough suggestion are huge, offering a solution to what that vast amount of missing stuff might be.We now think that both dark matter and dark energy can be unified into a fluid which possesses a type of \u0027negative gravity\u0027, repelling all other material around them, said Dr Farnes.\u0026nbspAlthough this matter is peculiar to us, it suggests that our cosmos is symmetrical in both positive and negative qualities.Negative matter has been proposed before, since it would mean that the material would become less dense as the universe expands. That would contradict real observations, which shows that dark energy does not thin out over time.However, Dr Farnes\u0026nbsptheory suggests that new dark energy is being created all the time. Since more and more negative energy is constantly bursting into existence, such a fluid would not dilute even as the universe expanded.That proposed fluid appears to work exactly as dark energy does.The outcome seems rather beautiful: dark energy and dark matter can be unified into a single substance, with both effects being simply explainable as positive mass matter surfing on a sea of negative masses, he said.Researchers now hope the theory can be tested using the huge\u0026nbspSquare Kilometre Array, which is being built now and when finished will be the biggest telescope in the world. But if true it could fix\u0026nbspLambdaCDM, our current picture of the universe, explaining what exactly the dark matter and energy that has been so problematic for our physics is made up of.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Whether the UK had this power or not has been disputed, and campaigners had asked judges to rule.This isn’t a final legal ruling by the court, but judges usually endorse what the advocate general suggests. We should find out if this recommendation is confirmed within the coming weeks, with 17 December one date that is being talked about in Brussels.\u0026nbspIf it is confirmed, an accidental no-deal Brexit is effectively taken off the table – the government would be able to stop it in all circumstances if it wanted to.\u0026nbspThis is significant because the government’s main argument to remainer MPs to get them to support Theresa May’s deal has been that if they don’t, a disastrous no-deal Brexit could happen without anyone wanting it to. In one respect, the decision makes it harder for May’s deal to pass, because she won\u0027t be able to scare them into backing it.Meanwhile, in WestminsterAs the news from the Luxembourg court broke in the morning , MPs were settling in for a big day in Westminster. By the time they went home for the night, the Government had been defeated in three votes – a record bad day for Theresa May’s minority administration.One of these votes was about whether the Government was in contempt of parliament for refusing to release its legal advice about its Brexit deal. MPs decided that ministers were indeed in contempt – effectively forcing the government to release the legal advice. This is significant because the advice is expected to provide more ammunition for opponents of the deal, especially Brexiteers.But another vote lost by the government will likely have even bigger implications. MPs – including 26 Tory rebels – voted to give parliament more power if Theresa May’s deal is voted down.If the deal is voted down next Tuesday the Government has 21 days to come back to Parliament and lay its plan for what happens next. But under the successful amendment tabled by Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve, the Commons will also be able to vote on what it wants the Government to do. Though that vote wouldn’t technically be binding, it would be politically incredible for the Government to ignore it.\u0026nbspTaken together with the likely ECJ ruling that the UK has the power to stop Brexit if it wants, MPs would be expected to take no-deal off the table. They might also call for a so-called ‘plan B’ – a call for Theresa May to go back to Brussels and negotiate a different deal. Whether that would be successful is another matter.So what are the implications for Brexit?The overall effect of the events of Tuesday 4 December are to make a no-deal Brexit significantly less likely. Nobody thinks there is a majority of MPs in favour of a no-deal, and they will now control the Government’s response to its deal being defeated.\u0026nbspIf the ECJ decides that the UK does have the unilateral power to revoke Brexit, then no-deal is effectively off the table. But even if it doesn’t it’s unlikely member states would stand in the way and push Britain off the cliff.In one sense, the deal is also less likely to pass because of what happened: Remainers were being encouraged to vote for it on the basis that a no-deal might happen.\u0026nbspBut in a strange way, the deal might win more support – if Brexiteers decide that the defeat of the deal might mean Brexit not happening at all, they could swing behind it.

What happens if Theresa May\u0027s deal is voted down?  What are the alternatives to May\u0027s deal?Click to followIndy PoliticsNo one in their right mind would want to come in and take over as prime minister to sort out the mess that is Brexit. We are entering one of the most uncertain periods in the modern history of Britain, with even the most experienced\u0026nbsppoliticians and commentators unsure of what the immediate future holds.This article will help you get to grips\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspwith some of the various outcomes from Brexit that the UK faces, and how we might get to them.It\u0026nbspwill be updated regularly as the picture shifts day by day...1 What are the key dates? 11 December: This is the day of the \u0027meaningful vote\u0027, when MPs\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbspdecide in the House of Commons whether to accept or reject Theresa May’s deal.13 December: A summit of the European Council will start in the wake of the meaningful vote in the UK. If British MPs have rejected the deal May agreed with other member states, this could be an opportunity for her to request changes, to allow it to become more palatable to MPs.20 December: This is when the House of Commons breaks up for Christmas. If May\u0027s deal has been rejected the week before, and she wants\u0026nbspto put it to MPs\u0026nbspa second time before the holidays, it must happen before this date.7 January: The House of Commons returns, but to what? If the deal on the table has been blocked once, there may still be a chance for a second vote at this point.\u0026nbspThe prime minister may or may not have resigned and MPs\u0026nbspmight or might not have attempted to pass an amendment for a second referendum.7 January\u0026nbspto 29 March: If those points above haven\u0027t been addressed before the Christmas break, they likely will be in this period. You may also see a push for the UK to opt for a Norway-style relationship.29 March: Brexit Day. Under terms of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, if a country triggers the withdrawal process from the EU, they have two years to try to conclude negotiations on how it happens before their membership automatically ends – regardless of whether those negotiations have been successful or not.2 What happens if Theresa May\u0027s deal is voted down?The big question to which no one knows the answer. There are lots of possibilities if\u0026nbspMay’s plan fails as expected. Here are those likely to be pursued or rejected early on...\u0026nbspRenegotiation:\u0026nbspThere will be an opportunity to renegotiate within days at a summit of the European Council, but pretty much everyone at the meeting has been adamant there will be no further changes to the package agreed, even if MPs vote it down.That does not mean it is absolutely impossible –\u0026nbspboth sides currently have an interest in saying the deal cannot be renegotiated,\u0026nbspto encourage MPs to back it.\u0026nbspBut the incentive to find a different deal will become greater if the current one is rejected.The prime minister pushes the deal to a Commons vote... again: It may be that the PM does win some small further\u0026nbsptweaks to the language in the withdrawal deal that mean\u0026nbspshe can go back to the Commons and ask for it to be voted on a second time.\u0026nbspAlternatively, a\u0026nbspplunging pound and disruption to financial markets if the deal is voted down a first time, could also give May a reason to ask MPs\u0026nbspto vote again and wave through her deal in the national interest.This course is only likely to be an option\u0026nbspif the first defeat is by a small margin. If her administration loses with 100 Tories voting against her,\u0026nbspgoing back for a second attempt will look pretty futile.General election:\u0026nbspTheresa May could try to take a stand, calling\u0026nbspan election and\u0026nbspsaying her deal is the foundation of the Tory manifesto in a bid to win a popular mandate for it. If she could, it would make it difficult for her MPs\u0026nbspto rebel. But there’s a fundamental flaw in the plan. Under the Fixed Term Parliament Act a prime minister no longer has the power to call an election at will. Either they have to win a vote in the Commons by a two-thirds majority, or they lose a vote of no confidence by a simple majority. For both of these things, lots of Tory MPs\u0026nbspneed to vote for an election, and with their seats at risk and a left-wing Corbyn government waiting in the wings, they are not likely to do so.\u0026nbsp3 What are the alternatives to May\u0027s deal?If it finally sinks in that the PM’s strategy is dead, other possibilities start to arise...A second referendum:\u0026nbspThere will at some stage be a big push for a new referendum.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsphas campaigned for the public to have a\u0026nbspFinal Say, with more than one million people signing its petition. The\u0026nbspPeople\u0027s Vote\u0026nbspcampaign has galvanised the support of politicians, celebrities and millions of others across the country.The new referendum would, however, have to be secured through a vote in the House of Commons and it appears that there is no majority for it at this time. Lots of Conservatives are opposed. Labour appears to be moving towards possibly backing one, but the party is split and leader Jeremy Corbyn is said to be against the idea. Even if Labour does back it, there are likely to be up to 20 of the party’s\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspwho still vote against it, because their constituents so heavily backed leaving the EU that it would risk them being ousted at the next election.Time could change this situation. As other possible outcomes are whittled away and the prospect of an economically damaging no-deal Brexit looms, more\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspmay feel compelled to back a new referendum. The question of timing will be critical. Some backers feel the issue should be pushed to a Commons vote, as an amendment to the “meaningful vote”, fearing that waiting will mean other outcomes take hold and become more likely. Others say if the vote is brought to the Commons too soon, without enough support, and it falls – then supporters will lose their only chance of making it happen.\u0026nbspThere is also not a consensus on what the question should be in a new vote – in or out, May’s deal or no deal, no deal or Remain. Some suggest a three-way vote on May\u0027s deal, no-deal and Remain, with the option receiving the fewest votes being knocked out and votes redistributed, as in the “alternative vote”\u0026nbspelectoral system.\u0026nbspEven if a proposal for a new referendum is passed, there is every chance Leave could win again, of course.Plan B (Norway):\u0026nbspThere are those – including some in cabinet – who believe that once the deal is ditched the best plan would be for the UK to enter a Norway-style arrangement with the EU. This would either be\u0026nbsptemporary until a wider trade agreement can be arranged or\u0026nbspa permanent solution. It would mean leaving the EU, but staying in the single market. A “Norway-plus”\u0026nbsproute could also see the UK remaining in the customs union.But this is likely to enrage half of the Tory party in parliament, and probably all of the more\u0026nbspBrexitish\u0026nbspmembership, as a less than full break from Brussels. It also does not end “free movement”, risking a backlash from Leave voters for whom immigration was the key issue in 2016.An extension to the Article 50 period:\u0026nbspThe EU has indicated that the 29 March\u0026nbspBrexit day could be postponed, but only if there is a set course of action to postpone it for. In other words they could delay it for a new referendum or an election. It is not clear if they would do it for a late renegotiation.No deal:\u0026nbspThis is the default. If May’s deal is voted down and the government and\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspdo, or are able to do, nothing else, then on 29 March Britain will fall out of the EU with no deal in place. Many\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspare looking for ways to stop that from happening.In the Commons on 4 December,\u0026nbspMPs backed a move that will allow them to amend a motion bought forward by the government, setting out their\u0026nbspplans if May’s deal is rejected.This gives MPs\u0026nbspthe chance to express a clear view of what should take place next. This could be any of the\u0026nbspabove options including opposing no deal, backing a new referendum or going into a Norway-style status.This motion would not be legally binding on the government, but it would be impossible to ignore. Certainly doing so would create a major political crisis.Then again, we are already going through\u0026nbspconstitutionalpoliticalsocial\u0026nbspcrises of sorts, so predicting exactly what will happen is extremely difficult.\u0026nbspThis is something that could occur at any time. She may feel that if her deal is rejected by\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbsponce, or even twice, then the collapse of her strategy means she should quit and let someone else have a go. Tory rebels may also try to force her out.Under party rules they need to secure 48 letters from Conservative\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspdemanding she stand down, to trigger an internal vote of no confidence in her leadership. But so far rebel attempts to achieve the letters have verged on the incompetent. Even if they can get them, May’s team think they can win the overall vote.There is the question of successors too. Boris is unpopular in the parliamentary party, other Brexiteers do not seem credible. A\u0026nbspRemainer\u0026nbspis unlikely to win. It is not clear Jeremy Hunt or\u0026nbspSajid\u0026nbspJavid, the other two frontrunners, have a plan that would somehow eliminate the problems May faces.The reason May lasts through the toughest period yet could be the same reason she has lasted up to now. No one in their right mind would want to come in and be the prime minister to sort out the mess that is Brexit. Better to let May take the hit, and then come in to look to a brighter future afterwards.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The key issue that we’re\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbsptoday, and that’s why we’re delivering a petition signed by a million people in this country, is that those choices are ones that should be made by the British people.“Parliament is gridlocked ... This is no way to decide the most fundamental question facing Britain for the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years.“It is time that we now put the clear choices to the British people and allow them to decide.”Thornberry contradicts Jeremy Corbyn and insists Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumThe two documents were handed in to officials at 11am by Ms Greening, politicians from three other parties and The Independent‘s editor Christian Broughton.\u0026nbspLabour’s\u0026nbspChuka Umunna, a champion of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “The biggest issue that we’ve had since the Second World War is being left to MPs. And the problem we have with MPs\u0026nbspin parliament, is\u0026nbspthat they can’t come to a view of what should happen in this situation.“The bottom line is how else are you going to resolve impasse in Westminster if not by referring it back to the people. I don’t know anyone who has come up with a viable alternative.”\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the “let’s-just-get-on-with-it”\u0026nbspattitude is a “fallacy”, because “even if we accept the government’s deal we’re not just getting on with it”.“We’ll be spending years in negotiation of what kind of arrangement we’d want with the European Union – the problem isn’t going to go away,” he said.The prime minister has repeatedly said that she will not countenance a further referendum on Brexit. But with no option carrying a majority in the Commons, a new vote has become\u0026nbspa more likely way to break the political deadlock.\u0026nbspReferring to calls for a new referendum on Monday, Ms May said: “People are talking about a second vote when we haven’t even delivered on the first vote.“I think we need to deliver on the first vote. We asked people to vote. We said ‘please decide whether we should leave or remain’.“People voted to leave and I think there’s a, sort of, democratic duty on us as politicians, having had that referendum, and having said it is your choice, to actually deliver on it. So, let’s deliver on the first vote.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

In recent days she has outlined how her proposals will deliver on the\u0026nbsppublic’s desire to end EU free movement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

However, if is passed it would underscore the difference between many members of the US foreign policy establishment and Donald Trump.\u0026nbspIt would\u0026nbspalso force Mr Trump to decide whether or not to veto the measure.Sean Penn filming documentary on murdered journalist Jamal KhashoggiMr Trump has repeatedly sought to defend the crown prince, denying reports that the CIA had concluded he was behind October’s killing of the 59-year-old journalist at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\u0026nbspLast month, the president issued a statement saying the US would remain a steadfast ally of Saudi Arabia, even though the prince “may or may not” have been behind the killing that triggered global outrage.\u0026nbsp“I’m not going to tell a country....that has helped me keep oil prices down...I’m not going to destroy our economy by being foolish with Saudi Arabia,” Mr Trump.Jamal Khashoggi murderAfter emerging from a private briefing with CIA Director Gina Haspel, Mr Graham of South Carolina, said\u0026nbspa person would have to be “willfully blind not to come to the conclusion this was orchestrated and organised by people under the command of Mohammed bin Salman”.The Hill said the Senate is bracing for a chaotic floor fight over the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen and Mr Khashoggi’s murder.Senators voted to kick a resolution to the full Senate last week that would require Mr Trump to withdraw troops in or “affecting” Yemen within 30 days unless they are fighting Al-Qaeda.The resolution also calls on the Saudi government to negotiate with representatives of the Houthi movement and agree to a political resolution and end the country’s humanitarian crisis. The bombing campaign – supported by a number of Gulf nations as well as the US and UK – has resulted in a massive humanitarian catastrophe.Senator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the foreign relations committee, and who supports ending US support for Saudi Arabia’s bombing of Yemen, said his views had only solidified after attending the briefing on Capitol Hill.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The flag-draped casket of former US President George HW Bush is carried by military pallbearers past US President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump, former President Barack Obama, former first lady Michelle Obama, former President Bill Clinton, former first lady Hillary Clinton, former President Jimmy Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter as it arrives at his state funeral at Washington National CathedralHigh school students burn a barricade in front of their high school during a demonstration against French government Education reformsSully, the service dog of former US President George HW Bush in his final months, lays in front of Bush\u0027s casket at the George H Lewis \u0026amp Sons funeral home in Houston, TexasCourtesy Office of George HW BushReutersDemonstrators march in Brussels to \u0027claim the climate\u0027 as world leaders meet in Poland to discuss the Paris climate agreement targetsA protester moves to lob a tear gas canister during a protest in Paris today against rising fuel pricesUS President Donald Trump, Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wave hands in front of other leaders during a family photo at the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, ArgentinaFirefighters battle a blaze on Fingerfield road at the Deepwater National Park area of Queensland.

The company, which is also phasing out the use of plastics, cited concerns about environmental degradation and deforestation, which is destroying the habitats of many critically endangered species, such as the orangutan.A freedom of information request by Unearthed\u0026nbsp– Greenpeace’s investigative journalism unit – revealed, six days after Iceland’s announcement, British diplomats had written to colleagues in Indonesia and Malaysia about how to handle the nations’ apparent concern over the supermarket’s move.Norway to heavily restrict palm oils linked to deforestationIndonesia is at the brunt of US laws to reduce fossil fuel dependence Why is palm oil bad for the environment, and how can people help?One email read: “The Indonesians and Malaysians need to recognise that these developments are being driven by (legitimate) concerns about the environmental impact of palm oil production, which they have not adequately addressed. It is not for us to argue the case for palm oil.”Emails exchanged between officials at the Foreign Office, the Department for International Trade (DIT) and the Department for International Development (DfID) at around the same time, suggest diplomats had been urged by the Malaysian and Indonesian governments to intervene with Iceland over its opposition to palm oil.Iceland has since made further headlines, after releasing an advertisement in collaboration with Greenpeace that featured a cartoon orangutan mourning the loss of his rainforest home, and which was voiced by the actress Emma Thompson.The ad was banned after it was deemed to have breached political impartiality rules.The ban intensified attention around the issue, though, sparking debate over advertising standards and the impact of palm oil, and providing Iceland with significant publicity – the ad has been watched more than 30 million times online, Greenpeace said.Malaysian officials took the unusual step of celebrating the UK regulator Clearcast’s decision to uphold the ban.Teresa Kok, Malaysia’s primary industries minister, said: “We will not be cowed or stand by idly\u0026nbspwhen nasty advertisements by Iceland mislead people in markets that are crucial to us. We will fight back with facts from scientifically researched data.”Another FOI request by Greenpeace this year\u0026nbsprevealed some of the other methods by which the Malaysian government had\u0026nbspattempted to maintain its European export markets.In May, British diplomats warned the UK government backing a proposed EU ban on imports of palm oil could put a lucrative arms deal between BAE systems and the Malaysian government at risk.British officials said supporting the ban could prompt Kuala Lumpur to rule out a multimillion pound deal to replace its fleet of fighter jets with British built Typhoon aircraft.Over the last 15 years, demand for palm oil has soared\u0026nbspand the product is found in a huge range of foods and toiletries. It is now thought to be present in around half of all supermarket products, leading the industry to launch attempts to certify it is sustainable.But Richard Walker, Iceland’s managing director, said\u0026nbspthe supermarket had decided to remove palm oil because there was none available on the mass market that could be verified as sustainable.Created with Sketch.

Inside, dim lamps lead the way down a narrow passageway into a warren of small rooms where the air is cool and damp. There is a kitchen, a bedroom with mattresses laid out, a prayer room and a command centre where orders are barked through a crackling radio.This is what the inside of a Hezbollah tunnel looks like. The Israeli army – the militant group’s greatest foe – launched an operation this week to destroy tunnels much like this one, which it had discovered running underneath the border and into Israel.But this tunnel in Mleeta, southern Lebanon, remained undiscovered in the nine years it was used by Hezbollah fighters to launch attacks against occupying Israeli troops. Today, it is part of a sprawling interactive museum complex that glorifies that fight.“Israel didn’t know about this tunnel until we opened it up to the public in 2010,” says Ahmed Mansour, a spokesman for the museum. “It was kept hidden for all that time.”At a time when Hezbollah’s subterranean activities are under renewed scrutiny, the museum at Mleeta serves as a reminder of the crucial role that tunnel warfare has played in the group’s past, and will likely play in its future.Work began on the tunnel here at Mleeta in 1989, seven years into Israel’s 1982-2000 occupation of Lebanon. It took 1,000 men more than three years to dig, and when completed it became an important outpost for the group, allowing fighters to move undetected by drones and jets.“There was a big difference in strength between the two sides,” says a guide at Mleeta who did not want to give his name. “The tunnels were simple but very effective.”TarlingThe Independent)When Israel eventually withdrew from Lebanon, Hezbollah quickly began preparing for the next battle. The Iran-backed group built hundreds more complexes like this across the south.“Between 2000 and 2006, Hezbollah constructed a very elaborate and comprehensive underground infrastructure in the south Lebanon border district, consisting of bunkers and tunnel networks,” says Nicholas Blanford, author of Warriors of God: Inside Hezbollah’s Thirty-Year Struggle Against Israel.Israeli army launches operation to uncover Hezbollah tunnelsThose tunnels were used to great effect in the devastating 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel, in which more than 1,000 Lebanese civilians and 44 Israelis were killed, according to Blanford. The conflict ended in a stalemate, which Hezbollah touted as a victory.“They were able to launch rockets from underground facilities close to the border with Israel and to ambush Israeli troops that penetrated Lebanese territory,” he says.That tunnel network could be utilised to even more deadly effect in the event of another war, a point that has become more relevant in recent months.TarlingThe Independent)Over the past few years, Hezbollah and Israel have taken their rivalry to the battlegrounds of the Syrian civil war. But as that conflict is winding down, Lebanon is again becoming a focus for them both.Israel has watched with concern as Hezbollah has emerged from the Syrian conflict significantly stronger. The group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, claims to have built up an arsenal of longer-range and more accurate missiles.The cross-border tunnels add another dimension to Hezbollah’s threat. If utilised, the group would be able to send fighters to attack Israeli towns and villages.The Israeli army began digging on its side of the border on Tuesday, and announced later in the day that it had destroyed one tunnel that began in a home near the border village of Kfar Kala and stretched some 40 metres into Israel. \u0026nbspThe discovery has raised tensions along the border, which has been relatively quiet since 2006. Speaking on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the tunnels “an unacceptable act of wanton aggression”.“These cross-border terror tunnels were built by Hezbollah with a direct support and funding from Iran. They were built with one purpose in mind: to attack and murder innocent Israeli men, women, and children,” he said.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The flag-draped casket of former US President George HW Bush is carried by military pallbearers past US President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump, former President Barack Obama, former first lady Michelle Obama, former President Bill Clinton, former first lady Hillary Clinton, former President Jimmy Carter and former first lady Rosalynn Carter as it arrives at his state funeral at Washington National CathedralHigh school students burn a barricade in front of their high school during a demonstration against French government Education reformsSully, the service dog of former US President George HW Bush in his final months, lays in front of Bush\u0027s casket at the George H Lewis \u0026amp Sons funeral home in Houston, TexasCourtesy Office of George HW BushReutersDemonstrators march in Brussels to \u0027claim the climate\u0027 as world leaders meet in Poland to discuss the Paris climate agreement targetsA protester moves to lob a tear gas canister during a protest in Paris today against rising fuel pricesUS President Donald Trump, Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wave hands in front of other leaders during a family photo at the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, ArgentinaFirefighters battle a blaze on Fingerfield road at the Deepwater National Park area of Queensland.

In October, Mr Trump signed new sanctions against Hezbollah, promising to “target, disrupt, and dismantle their operational and financing networks”.He said of the group, which was behind a 1983 bombing of a US barracks in Beirut that killed 241 Marines, “No terrorist group other than al-Qaeda has more American blood on its hands.”At a time when the group is already under financial strain for its involvement in the Syrian civil war, those sanctions may do more damage than the destruction of a few tunnels.“The exposure of the tunnels for Hezbollah is not the end of the world,” says Blanford. “It’s quite possible they will have tunnels that the Israelis won’t know about, and won’t be able to detect.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There is no point in the Government trying to hide that fact.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.At the start of a key debate in Parliament on her Brexit plan, the Prime Minister said the backstop was not a trap for Britain.The backstop is not a trick to trap us in the EU, said Mrs May.It actually gives us some important benefits of access to the EUs market without many of the obligations and that is something the EU will not want to let happen, let alone persist for a long time."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT0004530656212.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sun says goodbye george bush","story":"Alongside Western allies, none more important than the British, he helped to steer the world through the end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the birth of young democracies across Eastern Europe.And he led an international coalition to victory in the first Gulf War, after Margaret Thatcher told him it was “no time to go wobbly” and that their shared values were worth fighting for.He was part of a group of world leaders who had the courage of their convictions and a belief in freedom and liberty, both economic and social.The tributes paid to the President from those who worked with him in new, emerging nations show how important that faith was.Politicians today could learn from his steadfast commitment.History will remember him fondly. WE couldn’t agree more with Ofsted boss Amanda Spielman.Our schools cannot become surrogate parents. They are there to teach — not to solve the obesity crisis, toilet-train kids or take knives out of teenagers’ hands.There is a growing trend in our politics and our society to take away responsibility from iniduals.Everything from the ludicrous sugar tax to banning speakers from universitiesthey dare to contradict the snowflake agenda all flow from this sinister belief that we can’t be trusted to look after ourselves or make sensible decisions.Schools being used as a catch-up service is a symptom of a culture where too often we’re told that somebody  will do it for us.More people like Ms Spielman must come out and say enough is enough.We must put personal responsibility back at the centre of all our lives. SPEEDBOAT killer Jack Shepherd is treating our justice system with contempt. It is staggering we’re paying for it through Legal Aid.Politicians continually pay lip service to making changes to the legal aid system, but case after jaw-dropping case continues to come into the public eye.It’s important that everybody has access to justice, and financial support is a key part of that. But it cannot be abused.And it’s hard to imagine a more blatant case of that than dishing it out to a coward who refuses to answer for his crimes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We must be duly punished.EU leaders can see — apparently more clearly than our own abject leaders — just how well we might do and how much of a threat a prosperous, independent Britain would pose to their Grand Project.Nobody can be certain what will happen after next Tuesday’s crunch vote.A snap election or a second referendum are unthinkable but possible.Returning to full EU membership is both unthinkable and impossible.There are alternatives... the Norway Option, Canada Plus... but they are fraught with complications.Yet there is a way we could avoid Mr Gove’s “turbulence” and leave in an orderly fashion without any deal at all.We don’t have to “crash out” or drive off a clf like Thelma and Louise.Neither option would be good for Britain — or the EU.It should be possible to negotiate a  to -month window to prepare a deal which suits both sides — and pay an appropriate sum to Brussels for the extra time.First, of course, we need a new leader and a new Prime Minister.That is almost as complicated as Brexit.DISGRACED Labour MP Kate Osamor has finally quit Jeremy Corbyn’s team, but only after proof she lied about knowing her son Ishmael was a convicted drug handler.Ms Osamor told a Times reporter who confronted her with the evidence: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your face in.”“F*** off,” she added and chucked a bucket of water.Two questions. Is it any surprise Ishmael grew up with contempt for the law And what would have happened to a Tory MP who behaved like that to ahack Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And because it keeps us in a customs union preventing us enacting our own trade deals.Despite the persuasive efforts of Attorney General Geoffrey Cox yesterday, we just don’t believe the EU will seek to avoid the backstop — or let us leave it.It will do anything to prevent an independent free-trading powerhouse on its doorstep. And once we’ve paid our £billion “bill” our leverage is gone.Why did our negotiators not demand a way to exit this trap  Because they didn’t think Brussels would agree. Such has been the feebleness of our efforts since David Cameron first had a go.Mrs May is now reduced to claiming we CAN do our own trade deals before the backstop kicks in. And yes, we can sign them . . . but they may never come into effect.The PM should not waste a week trying to sell this bad deal to the public.She shouldto Brussels and tell them it won’t work.GIVEN how many terror attacks MI has helped foil in Europe, you’d think Brussels would want the UK’s security and military might onside.Instead, out of spite, they are freezing us out of the Galileo satellite project we have invested £.billion in.Theresa May still insists we “will remain committed to Europe’s collective security” after Brexit.Pity the Brussels pygmies can’t say the same.IMAGINE the outragea Tory MP abused and threatened areporter with a savage beating for asking questions.That politician would be toast.Yet somehow Corbynista Kate Osamor is still a Labour MP.She employed her son in Parliament despite his serious drugs conviction, then lied about when she knew of it.When a Times reporter challenged her she swore at him, threatened to beat him with a bat and threw a bucket of water over him.She’s even banned from editing Wikipedia for doctoring her own entry.For now, she’s off Corbyn’s front bench.

Most are keen and eager to learn. That’s why teaching can be a really rewarding job, but there’s no doubt it is also a tough one.Today I will be launching my annual report, which will show that, overall, schools in England are doing a good job.The vast majority of children are attending good or outstanding schools, which is as it should be. Young people get just one shot at childhood — leaving no room for complacency.Yet in recent years it feels like more and more is being asked of schools and teachers, which could put this improvement at risk.They are being asked to do things that should be done at home by parents, as they used to be.This is making the job of schools harder. It takes up too much precious time and stops teachers from doing their actual job — teaching.One of the most shocking examples I hear about is the growing number of children beginning their reception year still in nappies.I’ve asked about this in primary schools this year, and each time I’ve asked I’ve been told it is a real problem.This is dficult for teachers, embarrassing for the children concerned and disruptive to their classmates.Quite simply, it is wrong. Toilet training is the parents’ job. It should not be left to schools. Only in the most extreme cases should parents be excused from this most basic of parenting tasks.And this isn’t the only area that concerns me.We all know about the growing problem of childhood obesity. By the start of primary school, almost a quarter of children in England are overweight or obese. This is at the age four or five.This rises to more than a third by the time they go to secondary school.It is estimated that nearly , young people in the UK are now suffering from type  diabetes, an unpleasant disease normally only seen in people over the age of .Schools have an important role to play, teaching children about the importance of healthy eating and exercise. Kids need to get out of breath during PE.But schools can’t do it all. It is lazy for us to rely on schools to change kids’ habits.And the reality is, that as Ofsted research shows, schools on their own can’t make the dference. The answer to the obesity crisis, particularly among younger children, lies in the home, and parents need to make sure their offspring eat healthily, go outside, and don’t spend all day playing on electronic devices.There is no point in teaching about healthy choices, making sure school meals are healthy or having rules about what goes into a packed lunch,for breakfast, dinner and all weekend children have a supply of junk food.One of the saddest things I’ve heard about recently is cases where children have leftover fast food, cold chips or chicken nuggets, in their packed lunches the following day. With the best will in the world, schools cannot fight this single-handedly.Sadly, in some parts of our country, schools are also at the forefront of tackling a very dferent kind of risk: kne crime and gang culture.Thankfully most schools are safe, and of course they can help educate young people about the dangers of knives and how to avoid being drawn into gangs.But they cannot be expected to solve the problem alone. Preventing kne crime requires people working together — police, youth services, health services — to protect children and to do everything to bring those who cause harm to children to justice.However we must not forget the role of parents here either. This is about taking responsibility for your child. I accept that many families are busy and that some children have dficult and complex problems to deal with.But that doesn’t excuse parents from the basics of teaching their children right from wrong, giving them proper boundaries and security. And that means not trying to be their “best friend”.One answer may be to introduce more parenting classes. We know these can work and help parents who might otherwise be struggling.These shouldn’t be for schools to run, but perhaps to run in schools. Maybe now is the time to look again at the ambitions of the Le Chances strategy or the ideas behind the Sure Start programme.But parents must recognise they cannot off load their responsibilities at the school gate.Every minute we ask teachers to spend on these issues is time children aren’t learning the Rs, studying our nation’s history or the scientic forces that shape our world.I want schools to be able to do their proper job, and to let them do that, parents have got to step up.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Her parents orced when she was just six years old and it’s no secret that she’s now estranged from her father Thomas and his highly vocal, deliciously off-message side of the family.So, however well meaning she is, all her charitable grandstanding and repeated declarations of being “an independent woman” suggest she finds validation from being regarded as a, yawn, groundbreaking feminist role model rather than, as Kate is dismissed by some, a dutul we and mother, who toes the royal line and doesn’t make waves.But Kate has no need to virtue signal because she’s rooted in the love and respect of her tight-knit family — a set-up she’s replicating with William, who, after his own fractured childhood, clearly adores the normality of le Chez Middleton.And of course, they’re both equally secure in the knowledge that, post-“King Charles”, the top job is theirs.Harry, on the other hand, has chosen a bride who, despite her efforts at reinvention, has a chequered pastand a burning desire to be seen as more than just a pretty appendage to the sixth-in-line to the throne.That’s understandable.

The genetic editing also produces a higher muscle mass which means more meat is yielded and it also a lot less fatty.Kim and his colleagues originally produced more than  piglets.However, new images from a the farm in Banteay Meanchey, Cambodia shows the giant pig business is booming with pens packed full of porkers.The farmer raising the pigs is even offering to sell the sperm to others looking to breed the giants.He also shared video footage of the muscle-bound animals squealing as they fight over food.Scientists insist the mutation is safe because rather than transplanting genetic information from one species to another they have simply edited genes.However, at the moment no country allows its people to eat the genetically modied products.The EU bans any importing of genetically modied food into member states amid fears for the safety and quality of the meat.The UK Food Standards Agency said all genetically modiedfood has to undergo a rigorous safety assessment before it is permitted to be placed on the EU market.Animal-lovers reacted with a mixture of horror and fury after viewing the images online.One wrote: “This is grotesque!

I want my kids to make informed decisions – not a default decision and know what’s on offer.”He added: “We’ve been technical education snobs. We’ve revered the academic but treated vocational as second class - when we do it well, law, engineering, medicine - then we don’t even call it vocational. Why has this has been tolerated for so long  I think the reason is the “O.P.C” problem. For so many opinion formers, commentators and, yes, politicians: vocational courses are for ‘other people’s children’.”Fresh figures from the Department for Education show that in Germany almost  per cent of the population have qualications at the standard of A-levels. But in the UK the figure drops to  per cent.Officials said getting the low-skilled more qualied would result in a £ a week boost to wages - or £, a year.  Mr Hinds said Britain needed to up its game ahead of Britain leaving the EU.

Suddenly, every berk thinks that the phone in their hand gives them the right to publish anything they see.Either they have some gung-ho fantasy of being a war correspondent, responsible for recording a fracas without doing a damn thing about stopping it. Or  in their head they are suddenly Quentin ­Tarantino, recording a particularly tasty bit of violence.So we get incidents like last week’s, at a Towie-favourite nightclub in Gants Hill, North East ­London. A young woman was filmed being sexually assaulted as onlookers, some of them women, jeer at the “fun” and point cameras up her skirt.Were these people scared of intervening and pulling the thugs off her, and filming it in order to pass the footage on to club management and police  Nope, they just put it up on the internet for the world to share the jeering. The weird and wicked idea that this is somehow OK is growing.Incidents on planes, in clubs, in the street, in schoolyards, are filmed by bystanders who don’t even try to shout or intervene. They are then plonked online, just to get some strange kudos for the person filming it.From the US and, increasingly, here there are cases of onlookers recording the humiliation of other people, not responsibly and ethically in order to give it to the authorities — managements, police, teachers — but just to put it online and “go viral”.Take the coward who last month filmed a policewoman being violently kicked in the head, then posted the footage online with the caption “LOL.” Or the bully who posted a video of a drunk teen ­giving oral sex to more than  men in Magaluf, for the “banter”.And last week, a shocking video of a -year-old Syrian refugee boy called Jamal being dragged to the floor by his neck went viral. Then, because the poor boy has not been humiliated enough, his ordeal was shared online by “disgusted” celebs and MPs who proclaim to care but are, of course, unwittingly ­contributing to his suffering.Some may vaguely think they are activists exposing bad ­behaviour, but in cases like this they are no such thing. They are voyeurs, cowards, and exhibitionists. Because it’s the victim of the attack, not just the attackers, who gets humiliated.Anyone half-decent understands that only disgusting ­people go in for “revenge porn”, sharing intimate videos of someone they broke up with. Whether dumped or cheated on, that is a horrible thing to do and can make the victim suicidal. Young girls live in terror of it, on one hand encouraged to be sexy and on the other scared of having their most unguarded moments exposed to the world.It has, a few times, led to ­prosecution and so it should. But personal vengeance and associated “slut-shaming” is only part of it.The whole business of filming other people without consent needs to be seen for what it is — a form of unregulated, potentially irresponsible and damaging rogue journalism.  Smartphone tech and the internet should be ­governed by the same ethical rules journalism developed.Good editors pixelate faces and agonise about what is responsible reporting, and what is in the ­public interest.If it would be wrong for a news reporter to film, for no good ­reason, a person being humiliated, assaulted, or even just tumbling in the street or falling asleep in an embarrassing position on a train, then it is even more wrong for any selfish git with a smartphone to do it.Journalism has rules because it is public. Now that technology can make anyone’s instant shot just as public, the rules should be the same. And because the technology belongs to the “digital natives” who grew up with it, it is time they applied to it all those pious, ethical modern values which we hear so much about.Not all slut-shamers and gloating video bystanders are young — but a great many are.

The people had been given a voice.And the people said very clearly: We want to leave.But there was never a majority among our political class for leaving.tp composite more brexitBecause for two years the Remainer majority of MPs has done everything it possibly can to thwart the will of the people.They have undermined Theresa May and the Government when it tried to negotiate with Brussels.That’s the main reason the deal we have before us now is so weak.Because as soon as ministers set off to do battle, the likes of Philip Hammond and Justine Greening would be trying to pull the rug from under their feet.The biggest deceit is this. All the while these politicians are trying to scupper Brexit, they are putting on their sincere faces and saying: “We must respect the will of the people.”This is a downright lie and it has always been a downright lie.When Tory Remainers tell you we must get a good deal, they really mean we must not leave the European Union.When the Labour Party tells you that we must have a “good Brexit for jobs”, they really mean that we must not leave the European Union.When that coffin-faced bore Dominic Grieve, once our Attorney General, puts down amendments which effectively stop us leaving with a no-deal, he is really saying: “We must not leave the European Union under any conditions at all.”When they start lecturing you about how Parliament must be sovereign — they’re saying the same thing. We must not leave the EU.What has happened over the past two years has been a concerted campaign of treachery and betrayal.The Tory Brexiteers — with one or two exceptions, such as David Davis, Priti Patel and Jacob Rees-Mogg — haven’t helped by being a disorganised rabble.Too interested in their own political careers to do the dficult work of leading Britain towards a confident exit from that authoritarian bureaucracy.But it is the Remainers who have done the real damage.If they didn’t tell us, at every step of the way, that “the people’s vote must be respected” then I’d have a little more time for them.

Then threw a bucket of water at him.Then said: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your head in.”After which, this entitled madam actually rang  – twice – to say the reporter was “stalking” her.Unbelievable.Then there’s  Grandma Osamor, Kate’s mother Martha. Now ennobled as Baroness Osamor of Tottenham and taking her seat in the House of Lords at your expense.A supporter of Labour activists suspended over anti-Semitism.And once considered too left-wing even for the Labour Party, until Corbyn came along.What a great parenting job both she and her daughter have done.And do you suppose that either would be in the ­positions they are now were it not for the colour of their skin THE animal rights activists Peta want us to stop using  certain phrases which are nasty about animals.Such as, “No use flogging a dead horse”.Better to say: “You can’t feed a fed horse.” Which doesn’t sound right at all, to me.Some vegans are also supposedly  objecting to “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”, because it’s unkind to eggs.

It was a con job.Next time you toddle off to the polls, you lot, get it right.SO, Nigel Farage has deserted Ukip because he thinks the party has become too extremist.Fair enough, he’s probably right. The party looks dead and buried.It’s a shame that because of our first-past-the-post system Ukip were never able to capture many seats in parliament.I’ve never been a fan of proportional representation.Butwe had it, Ukip under Farage, above, would likely be our second or third biggest party by now.And those negotiations over  Brexit would be looking very dferent, wouldn’t they RESPECT to Wrexham driver Kenneth Samuels. He managed to fit ELEVEN people into his Ford Focus.Actually, he’s a Wrexham non-driver now, because the Old Bill caught him.  He was disqualied from driving for  months.I assumed at first that he was ferrying a troupe of dwarves to a panto.But no. There were children involved, which kind of antagonised the magistrates.If the police had looked a bit further I suspect they’d have found the entire Liberal Democrat Party in the boot.  And Speaker John Bercow in the glove box. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When the people cant, they tell politicians to figure it out. The courts pick their way through the detail trying to be fair to all sides, and only the journalists try to explain why its complicated. So it is with capital punishment, terrorism, drone strikes, tax reforms, benefit cuts and everything  in le. Most of us expect complexity, relying on others to help us find a balance that doesnt kill us. We vote for representatives, then ask them to rely on their judgement to decide everything until we demand they rely on ours. But with Brexit the whole things gone cockeyed. We voted for those who suggested our relationship with the EU was simple. Parliament voted enthusiastically for a simple referendum. The people gave a simple answer, the government issued a simple letter. The courts were the first ones to decide it was complicated and journalists have spent the past two years failing to explain much at all. Its hardly surprising were now in a world where simple people still demand a simple Brexit and that politicians rely on the people to figure it out for them. A ComRes poll shows that people oppose remaining in the EU, oppose leaving with Theresa Mays deal, oppose a second referendum and oppose leaving without a deal. Their big idea instead is to renegotiate, despite the fact weve done that for two years and all the clowns achieved was a joke buttonhole that squirts water at the EU infor poundbillion. Politicians are now so confused about whos supposed to be doing what that the Disgraced Dr Liam Fox says theres a real danger that MPs may attempt to stealBrexit from the British people, and Michael Gove said that not delivering a simple thing that isnt possible because its more complicated than that would be a fatal blow to faith in democracy. Andrea Leadsom smilingly added that Parliamentarians who want to be in government in the future will live to regret the decision they took last night, as though she were a Mafia consigliere threatening painful retribution against those who disrespected the Prime Minister. Lets just stop there. Lets go back a bit, and explain. In  there was a massive, global, banking crash. Had it been ignored by politicians everyone would be living out of dustbins by now. All right, Richard Branson would be in Necker and Alan Sugar on his yacht, but it would be dustbins for them too.   Politicians worldwide did their jobs and figured out a solution. Two years later there was a general election and the people couldnt pick a team, so politicians had to form their own. Bizarrely, the party that came second wasnt part of it. The not-quite winners teamed up with the actual-losers and took power with barely a flicker of democratic concern.In the years that followed they housed immigrants in areas that rarely voted for their parties. Despite the fact such people produced more tax than they spent, they cut services in those places more than in friendlier ones. The aim, and result, was that Labour-voting areas became more xenophobic and more likely to turn Tory on immigration issues. They declared the previous administration profligate, then accumulated so many debts theyve started selling them off. They promised a northern powerhouse, while investing poundbn in the south and cutting investment by poundbn in the north.Thats not normal behaviour for politicians of any stripe, as theyre usually fully aware they can be sacked at short notice. But THIS lot established fixed, five-year contracts, which meant democracy was limited.When we were finally allowed a vote, the people picked the team which had been doing all the above but pretending that it wasnt. That team then opted to protect itself - not the country - by offering a referendum on leaving the EU which it thought no-one would want to do. But the people, now thoroughly confused by lies, theft, quantitative easing, Question Time, austerity, bananas and everything  hurled at them for years, picked the easy road - the f*** it road. The team captains ran away, the pound noseed, and those left on the field started barking the chaos was all Project Fear and could be completely ignored.   A new team captain activated Article  and told Parliament it had no say. The courts intervened to say Parliament was sovereign. Newspapers said judges were the enemy. Parliament was cowed into backing Article , even though it was vague and fully-revokable.The government then spent two years not negotiating a deal that isnt actually a deal, before telling the people and Parliament its the only option when it isnt. Few people notice that were preparing to leave the EU with , more people in poverty than we had  years ago, or have asked whether Brexit is in their interests.When the four estates of a democratic nation are in such turmoil and acting in direct opposition to their normal roles, there is nothing to do but hold on and hope for the best. And now, the ship of state is righting itself. Journalists are explaining complexities and detail. Judges are regarded as refuge. And Parliament has, finally, begun holding government to account.   For the first time in history, those ruling the country have been proven to be in contempt of our democratic processes. For the first time since the Brexit vote, the government has been forced to bow to the will of those figuring things out on behalf of the people. And for the first time in  years the Mother of Parliaments is acting like a grown-up - something that happens when loyal MPs rebel for a principle, when politicians seek to listen to one anothers arguments, when the people take an interest in what is being decided on their behalf. Nothing is perfect. We live in a world where racists claim the same freedom of expression as journalists, and believe that makes it all right to hurl homophobic slurs at a columnist while chasing him down the street, to threaten Jewish MPs online, to cause BBC reporters to need bodyguards. In the past decade, the confusion in our system has been fed by fake news, populism and idiots. The reason that these things - more properly called propaganda, fascism and the unelectable - do not dominate our world is because the system self-corrects. Each part pushes and pulls against the others, and the result is stable, slow, progress.  That is what happened in Parliament yesterday. Its what, hopefully, will continue this week while they vote on Brexit. Remember ityou are asked to vote again. Remember it when a journalist tries to explain, when judges rule, when MPs rebel and amend and argue. Elsewhere, with Parliaments that do not scrutinise the government, dictators hold power. Where journalists cannot explain, the people are kept in ignorance. And where those things are actively attacked, the world grows dark -  journalists were murdered this year while  languish in jail, most of them for crimes against the state. While Putin and Bin Salman high-five after the dismemberment of a journalist, remember that reporters are the first bit of democracy that dies. In their wake come the opponents, the judges, and then the people. However confusing and chaotic your democracy is, hold on to it. Be glad you have an MP, especiallythey dont always do as theyre told. Seek out a journalist whos explained well and say thank you, because the occasional pat is the only encouragement they need to keep headbutting walls. Note what happens when people dont vote, and make sure you do. Above all, be glad you have an opportunity to argue about your nations direction, and that youre not the only one steering the ship.

With just five days to go until the crunch vote on her Brexit deal, the Prime Minister held private talks with sceptical Brexiteers to try and avert a crushing defeat. It came as the Government was forced to publish legal advice it tried to keep confidential, which confirmed the UK would be unable to quit the backstop without the EU’s permission. The backstop keeps Northern Ireland in a customs union to avoid a hard border on the -mile frontier with EU member Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Mrs May’s fragile government, launched a furious attack on the “devastating” advice. Nigel Dodds, the Northern Irish party’s shyWestminster leader, said: “The union of the United Kingdom is non-negotiable”. Read the full Brexit legal advice document   In a sign of how poor relations are between the two parties, the DUP suggested their  MPs would be willing to back Mrs May in a no-confidence vote onlyMPs first voted down her Brexit deal. Yet Downing Street claimed the Tory-DUP deal was still in place and that Northern Ireland would get the full poundbillion they had been promised. And whips are still concerned her premiership could come crashing downTory Brexiteer MPs support Labour in a confidence vote. Mrs May wants to broker a compromise plan to get rebellious MPs to back her which could include giving them a parliamentary “lock” on the backstop. It would mean the Government’s insurance policy to avoid a hard border with Irelanda trade deal is not struck would only come into forceMPs approved it. A No source said: “She understands people still have concerns and will be talking to colleagues.” Chief whip Julian Smith was despatched to a meeting of the hardline ERG group of Brexiteers to try to win them over. But with more than  Conservatives now stating that they are going to oppose the Government, the scale of the challenge looked insurmountable. MPs dismissed her “lock” proposals as a fig leaf. Former Brexit minister Steve Baker said: “It’s a silly idea few will fall for”. Brussels appeared to be preparing for Mrs May’s deal being voted down by putting Article , which triggered Brexit, on the agenda of next week’s EU summit.   It raised speculation that leaders might delay the UK’s departure date to July, in order to give Mrs May more time. The six-page legal advice by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox QC said the UK could become mired for years in negotiations with Brussels with no power to leave. The EU could apply to an shyarbitration  for Northern Ireland to remain in the EU customs area after Great Britain left, Mr Cox advised. Despite assurances the backstop,used, would be temporary, the situation would “endure indefinitely” until a trade agreement was reached. Mr Cox admitted it “does not provide for a mechanism that is likely to enable the UK lawfully to exit the UK-wide customs union without a subsequent agreement”. He warned the risk was “a political decision for the Government”. Mrs May insisted both she and Mr Cox had openly said the backstop was shyindefinite without a final trade deal. Mr Dodds said his party’s opposition to the deal had been vindicated.   “The legal advice just published proves Northern Ireland would be in full shyEuropean Union Customs Union while Great Britain is not,” he said. “This backstop is totally unacceptable to unionists and it must be defeated and arrangements renegotiated that uphold the commitments which the Prime Minister and her Government made.” Blasting the attempt to keep the advice secret, Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: “All that this advice reveals is the central weaknesses in the Government’s deal. It is unthinkable it tried to keep this information from Parliament and the public before next week’s vote.” Meanwhile, Labour MPs were surprised that Jeremy Corbyn opted not to attack Mrs May on Brexit at Prime Minister’s Questions following one of the most turbulent days of her premiership. And Unite General Secretary Len McCluskey, one of the Labour leader’s closest allies, dealt a blow to second referendum campaigners by suggesting voters would see it as a betrayal.The UK faces a new year recession as Brexit fears crush business and consumer confidence, economists predict. Chris Williamson, of IHS Markit, said: “The possibility of no deal has caused companies and customers to cancel spending.”"},{"url":null,"title":"theresa loses brexit vote what","story":"NewsIf Theresa May loses the Brexit vote this is what could happen nextThe Prime Minister appears doomed to certain defeat, unable to cobble together the numbers to force her blueprint through the CommonsShareCommentsByJason BeattieHead of politicsBen GlazeDeputy political editor:,  DEC NewsTheresa May faces the fight of her political le \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIf  MPs back Theresa May’s Brexit deal she will emerge victorious on Tuesday. The Tories have  MPs, plus she has a confidence and supply deal with Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, so all will be well for the Prime Minister, yes  Emphatically, no. In fact, she appears doomed to certain defeat, unable to cobble together the numbers to force her blueprint through the Commons. Thanks to Mrs May needlessly squandering David Cameron’s hard-won,fragile, majority at last year’s snap general election - the one she never needed to call - she has to rely on the DUP to win parliamentary votes. But despite the poundbillion bung she conjured up for the Ulster hardliners, the DUP will not support the pact because elements of the deal would make Northern Ireland dferent from the rest of the UK. That strips away the PM’s stitched-together majority in a trice. In her own party, insiders believe up to nine Tory Remainers could vote against the deal, piling further pressure on the premier.   And then there is the European Research Group, a seemingly innocent name for the Conservatives’ hardline Brexiteers. Scores of its members are set to revolt unless Mrs May conjures a compromise. Sources estimate up to  Tory MPs could vote against the deal. While some Labour MPs may rebel against Jeremy Corbyn and offer their support, it is highly unlikely to be anywhere near enough to save the PM’s pact. What happened in the Commons yesterday  Theresa May lost three crucial votes. MPs backed a Labour amendment which held the Government in contempt for refusing to publish its full legal advice on the Brexit plan. The advice will now be released, and could confirm the worst fears of the Brexiteers – making even more of them likely to vote down the deal. Then MPs backed an amendment by Tory MP Dominic Grieve which would give MPs a say on what happensTheresa May’s Brexit deal is voted down. This means they could block a no-deal Brexit, send the Prime Minister back to the negotiating table or even call for a second referendum. The PM is no longer in control of Parliament or the Brexit process.   Can Brexit be halted  Remainers have seized on the provisional findings of the The European Court of Justice’s advocate general, who said the UK can decide on its own to cancel its withdrawal from the EU. It is not a binding judgment but suggests the ECJ will come to the same conclusion in its official ruling. This would allow us to revoke Article , the two-year mechanism Mrs May triggered which started the countdown to our departure on March , . What happens next  The key moment is on Tuesday when MPs vote on Mrs May’s Brexit plan. Unless she persuades Tory rebels to change their mind she is heading for almost certain defeat. More than  Conservative MPs, the DUP, the vast majority of Labour MPs,  Lib Dems and the SNP have all said they will vote down the proposal. But some Brexiteers may take fright at Mr Grieve’s amendment, fearing it could scupper Brexit. What does the Prime Minister doshe loses  We are in uncharted territory. The law says Mrs May has toto Parliament within  days with an updated response. Much will depend on the scale of defeat. If it is close she could try to wring further concessions from Brussels. If she is heavily defeated she will be under intense pressure to resign.   Where does that leave Brexit  Nobody knows. MPs could send the PM back to Brussels but that would need the EU to agree to extend Article . Or Mrs May could call a snap election. This is a high-risk move for the Tories as it could land Jeremy Corbyn in No . MPs could also decide only a second referendum can break the deadlock. The default is that we crash out without a deal. But most MPs will do everything they can to prevent what they see as an economic calamity.

He told the Treasury Committee: “The signicant things that would need to be done at Doverwe are to have a WTO type arrangement with the European Union would involve some very signicant infrastructure works that could not be done in a matter of months. It would be years to complete.” Askedit would take two years, he said: “Well, I would suggest the planning system might struggle to approve such signicant infrastructure changes in two years, let alone get them built. So I think it would take quite a lot longer to deliver the kind of major infrastructure changes that would be neededwe were going to be looking at a long-term WTO-type relationship.” The Chancellor also revealed he plans to hold a Spring Statement before the end of March. The UK is set to leave the EU on March .  He told MPs that modelling conducted by the Treasury and other Whitehall departments showed that the UK would be worse-off economically under any Brexit scenario. But Mr Hammond insisted that it was worth taking what would be a very small economic hit under the Governments preferred Brexit in order to avoid the political and societal harm from cancelling EU withdrawal. The Chancellor told the Commons Treasury Committee: The analysis clearly shows that leaving the EU under any scenario that we are modelling has a cost - an economic cost. But he added: My own judgment is that we need a way forward which heals our country. We are a deeply fractured country, with opinion heavily polarised and trust in the political system correspondingly damaged. I would suggest... that ided countries are not successful countries. I have thought long and hard about this, and I have come to the conclusion that the future success of our country depends on us executing the instructions of the British people in the referendum, leaving the EU, but doing so in a way that minimises the impact on our economy and maximises the opportunity that we have in the future, so that we can come together as a nation and work together to exploit those opportunities in the future. Any solution which left the country ided, left a large segment of the population feeling betrayed, in my view, would have a negative political and societal impact that would far outweigh the very small economic impact that the White Paper scenario is showing.

Chris Sharp, , and his family were on a walk in New Brighton, Merseyside when they decided to visit the fast-food restaurant which recently opened. Looking to get shelter from the cold weather, and noticing several empty tables, they approached the eatery. However the father-of-five claims that staff told them it was too busy to come in and would not even let them wait in the doorway - despite the family seeing plenty of empty tables inside. Chris said: I was amazed, and askedthey were actually being serious. The kids just wanted a burger - they were freezing. I said cant we just wait in the door  All we were met with was a point blank no, and the door shut.  I couldnt believe the attitude - no explanation or anything. I think its ridiculous the way we were treated. A disgrace. Chris, who was with three of his young children and we Ashleigh at the time, said the family ended up going to Subway instead. Describing the situation, which is said to have happened on Sunday, he said: We went for a walk along New Brighton promenade because the weather was looking alright. We got to Fort Perch Rock and it started to get chilly.The kids were moaning that they were hungry so we decided to go to Burger King. But there were two people working there stood outside who told us you cant come in. They said the kitchen is busy so you have to wait outside for  to  minutes. Chris continued: I said whats the problem  Weve got an eight month old in the pram and a three-year-old I was carrying. By the time we have sat down and taken our coats off itd be about  minutes anyway, but they said no, youre not coming in. So we were left outside in the cold. Shocking.  We looked into the restaurant and there was no one at the till and only about eight or nine people sitting down eating. I was fuming to be honest. The kids were crying. Chris said it was doubly disappointing because there has been so much hype about the new restaurant opening recently. When askedthere was any chance he wouldto the store in future, he said: No chance. The way we were spoken to was disgusting. I couldnt believe it. It comes after the world-famous chain said it would open its new store with a brand new prime design, having received planning permission.  In November, it had advertisement consent approved by the council for its new signs - to bring the premises over to the Burger King brand. Approving the proposals, which were submitted in September, the council documents said: The proposed fascia signs are al and relate to the business premises, they do not have a detrimental impact on the character of the area, the building concerned and its neighbours and are therefore considered acceptable. Burger King was contacted for comment about the incident.

Researchers announced they have carried out , “whole genomic sequencing” on volunteers which can diagnose the lelong risk of cancers. Genetic data from five million Brits will help decide how best to treat tumours and predict how they will react to surgery or chemotherapy. The test, which currently cost around pound per person, also means people at risk of a certain cancer can alter their diet or take pills so they never develop it. Scientists say the gene sequencing could become “routine” and one day replace the current heel prick test at birth. It could lead to genes from every child being sampled in a bid to invent a cancer cure.   The Government says the NHS is the world’s first healthcare system to role out sequencing the human genome on such a scale. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “Sequencing the ,th genome is a major milestone in the route to the healthcare of the future. “Britain has led the world in this amazing technology and we do so again today as we map a course to sequencing a million genomes.Understanding the human code on such a scale is part of our mission to provide truly personalised care to help patients live longer, healthier and happier lives. The DNA sequencing of five million Brits will be taken in the next five years including the comprehensive whole genomic test on one million of the volunteers. Many tumours will not spread but it is dficult to know which are harmless and which will become deadly.Biopsies, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery can sometimes do more harm than good.  Anonymised DNA data from the patients along with their medical history will allow computers to predict how a tumour will react to ious treatments. Sir John Chisholm, chair of Genomics England which leads the project, said: “The results of this will be felt for many generations to come as the benefits of genomic medicine in the UK unfold. “It should become routine at some point in the future that your health record will contain some form of genomic test,” he added. DNA tests are already carried out on the NHS for a specic genetic mutation or risk. Whole genomic sequencing tests are dferent as they look for mutations linked to  dferent cancers and , other diseases. Since the , Genomes Project was launched in  around , of the , volunteers had rare unexplained diseases diagnosed for the first time.A further , were diagnosed with cancers and given more effective treatment. Professor Mark Caulfield, chief scientist at Genomics England, said genomic sequencing could replace the current heel prick test which tests for devastating neurological conditions. “Currently they do the heel prick test to look for nine dferent conditions,” he told a briefing in central London yesterday. “There may be potential in the future to look at much more and thereby avoid early le harm. “There are some conditions thatyou know about them could change the trajectory of the le of the child. There might be potential in the future to look more at avoiding whole le harm. “We might not feed [the information] to them in childhood but there are some conditions thatyou knew about them at birth could change the le of the child.   “There are examples where we can put children on a special diet or be given a treatment.” Health bosses said in future patients DNA data could be used with wearable biometric devices to flag up the risk of disease before it develops. They also admitted their had been attempts by hackers to access the DNA database. Foreign hackers were behind the unsuccessful attempts to get hold of the genomic data could be lucrative for firms to develop new treatments. Sir John said: “For sure these attempts have come from overseas.” Security measures adopted to protect patient information included employing a company to mount a simulated firewall assault. Since  when the first human genome was sequenced the cost of the process has plummeted from pound billion to just pound.   As the cost falls further whole genome sequencing will become more commonplace and wide-ranging, said the project leaders. A complete genome includes all of a person’s genes plus the DNA that does not directly code for proteins but may influence gene activity. Hidden within the genome may be altered elements of DNA that can trigger or worsen disease, or cause adverse reactions to medicines. Since  when the project was launched automated systems have been sequencing patient genomes at a rate of  a day. The initial target of , genomes has now been met with , sequences officially recorded. The number exceeds that of the , patients who contributed their DNA because every participant with cancer has three genomes sequenced.

Molly Phillips, , went to hospital for a suspected stroke but later realised she been strangled by the bars chef at their annual bash. Miss Phillips said she passed out after chef Nathan Webb gripped her neck at the Cameo Clubs festive party, which was held at the bar in Roath, Cardf on New Years Day. Footage from CCTV shown at an employment tribunal hearing captured the moment Mr Webb put his arm around her neck and strangled her, reports Wales Online.  The video, which Judge Alison Frazer refers to in her judgement, shows Mollys arms go rigid as the chef holds her neck and when he releases her, she collapses to the floor hitting her head. The employment tribunal ruled Ms Phillips was unfairly dismissed when bosses failed to properly investigate her complaint that she was strangled at the party. Molly told the tribunal she had since learned that her facial paralysis is more permanent than first thought and she may never be able to smile again. She said she was told her injuries were “were either caused by lack of oxygen or nerve damage”. The tribunal heard that Mr Webb was arrested over the incident but was released under investigation and remained employed by the Cameo Club after the incident.   Molly initially ed to work after the incident and told bosses she did not want to take any action. But as time went on, she became increasingly distrustful and fearful of the chef. Medics also told her that the injuries she suffered would have longer lasting effects than previously thought. Yet when she raised these concerns with the directors of the company, she was told to get over it and ultimately felt she had no choice but to quit.  In her judgement following the tribunal, judge Alison Frazer was heavily critical of the Cameos directors for failing to take her concerns seriously. She said: The fact was the CCTV evidence showed that Mr Webb had her in a hold which caused her to fall to the floor. It was only open to the Respondent to take a view as to what action was appropriate after it had impartially gathered the facts via an investigation. I find that from April onwards Mr Davies acted in a way which was dismissive of the Claimant’s feelings about the incident. He told her to ‘get over it’ when referring to the Christmas party incident. Since the incident, Molly says that as well as her partial facial paralysis, she suffers from PTSD, anxiety and depression. I can’t smile in photographs, she said.  People don’t notice it, but I notice it more than anything. If it’s still like that when I get married, I won’t be able to smile in my wedding photos. Things like that. It’s not nice. But for Molly, the worst bit was the fact her bosses didnt do anything. I’d worked there for two and half years and done everything to that place and it was just like, I realised I meant nothing to them and I was completely disposable, she said. In her evidence at the employment tribunal at Cardf Magistrates Court, Molly said she felt asthe directors didnt take her seriously. When she told director Jason Pearce, she claimed he responded by joking with Mr Webb as he walked past, telling him something along the lines of: “All right buddy  Hear you’ve been choking girls lately’. “I was never askedI was comfortable, how my medical condition was, nothing,” she said. Molly told the hearing that she found working at the establishment increasingly dficult as time went on.   She told the hearing that other alleged behaviour by Mr Webb included putting chilli in a staff member’s soup and threatening someone on a night out. After these incidents, she told her employers she had begun lose faith in their ability “to keep her safe in her workplace”. By March  she said she was “finding it hard to come into work and was crying both before and during my shts”. She told the tribunal: “Around the end of March I was in tears to Huw telling him that I just didn’t feel comfortable in work anymore but I was given the same response over and over, that he couldn’t ‘wave a magic wand and fix everything’. “Meeting after meeting I was just getting that same response and nothing more.” She also claimed she was told in one meeting on April  by Mr Davies to just “get over it, and the same comment was made again on April . In her written judgement, Judge Frazer criticised the directors for not fully investigating at this stage.   Judge Frazer wrote: She was able to carry on at work without suffering any real psychological effects, working alongside Mr Webb, until March. In March the Claimant observed two incidents that made her perceive the Christmas party incident in a dferent way. Rightly or wrongly, she formed the view from these incidents that he had the capacity to be violent towards women. This made her believe that she had been the victim of insidious violence at the hands of Mr Webb. Around this time, she also learnt that her facial paralysis was more permanent than initially anticipated. I find that this culminated in her feeling vulnerable around Mr Webb in the workplace. In my finding there was an inextricable link between the incident at the Christmas party and the workplace, even though it had happened off duty. It was a works Christmas party held on site. She also criticised the directors for their response to the CCTV footage.   She said: Mr Pearce understood from observation of the CCTV that the Claimant had been strangled. Mr Davies, on the other hand, denied that this was the case. Mr Pearce did not watch the video until April or May and Mr Davies only watched it once. And she concluded that because of their actions - and the actions of another person brought in to hear a grievance that Molly raised - Molly was justied in resigning. Judge Frazer concluded: [Molly] was constructively unfairly dismissed. Molly said she had a sense of relief when she found out she had won. It just feels like a weight lted, she added. I don’t want to think about it anymore. Cameo Club said it had no comment at all. Speaking after the hearing, a spokeswoman for South Wales Police said: A -year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of assault and he is currently released under investigation.

Arctic sea ice has declined by % in  years and the water flowing into seas warms them, expanding their volume. This has had a major role in raising sea levels up to eight inches over  years, said the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Expert Alesandro Silvano said the rise “weakens currents that trap heat and carbon dioxide, affecting global climate”. Rising heat also has an impact on our deserts, affecting their plants and animals. In some cases this is predicted to increase their size – they already cover a quarter of Earth. Firewood gathering and animal grazing are also converting semiarid regions into deserts.

But novice ers, of whom there are an one and a half million a year, pose the biggest threat to these erse ecosystems, which support a myriad of creatures, particularly in tourist hotspots, according to James Harvey, operations manager at Reef-World Foundation. “When you look at busy e sites, you often see more broken corals, a lower species ersity and a change in fish behaviour. These corals are less likely to recover from bleaching events. “Novice ers e in an upright manner, with their fins down,” he said. “They kick up sediment and corals use a lot of energy to clean themselves, which makes them vulnerable to climate change and disease.” Other risks posed to marine le by the industry include physical damage from heavy anchors used by e boats, and the oil and other pollution the boats discharge. Thailand, who makes % of its GDP from tourism, this year closed Maya Bay, made famous by Leonardo DiCaprio’s film the Beach, because of environmental damage by tourism.

Sophie White suffered severe chest pains, a painful three-month cough and severe tiredness, but says she was repeatedly turned away by her GP.The teenager was battling the worsening symptoms as she took her A-Levels, incredibly managing to get the grades for her first choice uni.versity. It was only after eight months of fighting that the keen runner got an X-Ray which revealed she had a cm tumour in her chest – news that turned her heart to “sludge”.She was forced to put her le on hold for a year to beat the disease and thankfully the resident from Basildon, Essex, got the treatment she needed. But she has urged other youngsters not to give up and fight for answers from doctors.Miss White said: “You know your own body better than anyone so trust what you feel and keep going until you get the answers you need.“Just keep on fighting. When I got the call that they had found a mass on the right side of my chest I felt my heart sunk to a sludge.“I never expected that to happen, it was quite frustrating for me and my family as I had been so many times.“In a way I was relieved as I knew something was wrong with me and could be done about it, but I was petried.”She added: “It should have been picked up earlier as I had been to the doctors five or six times over eight months before I was diagnosed.” After being diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma the brave youngster was referred to the Teenage Cancer Trust unit at the University College of London in September .A gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy regime followed which she bravely endured whilst her friends were enjoying their first year of university.And whilst they were styling their hair for nights on the town, she lost her locks as she endured six cycles of chemotherapy and  days of radiotherapy.“Losing my hair was the worst thing at first as that is what you associate with cancer but it does get better, you just adapt to it,” she said. “Being in the ward made it better as you realise you are not the odd one out and seeing everyone there being comfortable with no hair.”And added: “It was hard to watch my friends go off to uni and have the best time.“I made a friend who was in the same situation as me and it helped to be able to talk to her about it.“She knew how it felt to see people carry on with their lives while we were stuck in a little bubble.“Because my friends were all away at university, they couldn’t visit as much and when they were back it was hard to catch upI was feeling unwell.“That made my friendships with people I met through Teenage Cancer Trust even more important as I didn’t feel isolated.” Thankfully she got the all clear in the summer and was able to go to get her le back on track and is now studying Biological Sciences at Reading University.“I was so ready, I was just waiting to go to university,” she said.“I love my course and after having a year of being so dependent it is nice to be free.” And she has heaped praise on the Teenage Cancer Trust who helped her.“You wouldn’t expect it, but the Teenage Cancer Trust units have such a happy atmosphere and my friends could visit at basically any time, which was brilliant,” she said.“You’d always have people coming in to talk, like the ward school teachers, and music teachers, who didn’t come in to talk about anything medical, just to talk to you in a friendly way. “I feel so lucky to have been given my treatment at a Teenage Cancer Trust unit. It changed my outlook on my situation.”The Teenage Cancer Trust has urged others to follow in her footsteps and to keep fighting for a diagnosis.Sasha Daly , deputy director of policy and influencing said: “Cancer, whilst rare in young people compared to adults, is still the biggest killer of young people by disease.“We know that early diagnosis can make all the dference.“We too often hear heart-breaking stories about young people who are diagnosed with cancer too late.“We want this and future generations to be armed with the right information, so they are more likely to feel confident to visit their GP or talk to their familythey have any health concerns.”"},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast storm deirdre","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Storm Deirdre to batter UK with mph gusts tomorrowThe Met Office has issued a danger to le warning as road and rail commuters are told to expect widespread disruptionShareCommentsByNeil MurphyElaine McCahill:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video watch-weather-forecast-next-two-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailStorm Deirdre could pose a danger to le as Britain is battered by mph winds this weekend.

Those who are still on the traditional benefits system will receive the one-off tax-free payment of pound but it wont be paid to those on Universal Credit. The one-off payment was introduced to help those receiving benefits with the extra costs of the festive season and is usually paid to certain people in the first week of December. Those who receive  dferent types of benefits, includingPersonal Independence Payments, Disability Living Allowance, or those on a state pension, get the pound payment.Have you been affected by Universal Credit  Email webnews@mirror   One woman, who used to receive Employment and Support Allowance [ESA] before being moved onto Universal Credit, said she was not told by the Department of Work and Pensions [DWP] that she wouldnt receive the bonus. Meryl told the i: “What really angers me is it’s a cut that hasn’t even been publicly acknowledged. Somebody’s just decided that they’re not going to pay this any more, and we’ve been given no more information. “Eventually everyone will be on Universal Credit, so it’s a sneaky way to save money. They’re taking it away from everybody. “Sure, it’s not a lot of money in this current climate, but it’s still pound I would have spent on a gt for somebody  in my family. Our benefits are already being eroded, we’re already getting less money.   “They’re making a cut without telling anybody. It’s another example of cruelty. It’s just death by cuts. The DWP confirmed the cut and a spokesperson said: “Universal Credit claimants have never received a one-off December payment, but many disabled people on Universal Credit will be better off on average by pound month than when they received ESA.” People receiving Universal Credit can still receive Personal Independence Payment [PIP] and contribution based ESA, and would therefore still be eligible for the benefit.   The latest cut comes after it was revealed foodbanks are preparing for December to be their busiest month ever. The Trussell Trust said its network of over  foodbanks provided almost , three-day emergency food supplies in December last year, a % increase for the monthly average for the   financial year. The figure was % up on December , said the Trust, adding that use of foodbanks has been increasing this year. The inability of benefits to cover essential living costs, and issues with payments, remain the most common reasons for people being referred to a foodbank, said the Trust. The five week wait for a first Universal Credit payment had made matters worse, said the charity. The Mirror are demanding a halt to the expansion of Universal Credit and for a review to take place. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition.  The Trusts chief executive Emma Revie said: Christmas is supposed to be a time for joy but what were seeing is the festive period becoming increasingly stressful for more and more people across the country. Our benefits system is supposed to protect us all from being swept into poverty, but what were seeing is people struggling to heat homes and put food on the table because they simply cannot afford the basics any more and that just isnt right. In the short-term were urging the public to donate generously during the first part of December and into the new year, as unfortunately the need for foodbanks is not going to end after Christmas.

Orthey prefer, they may choose to simply let it grow, au naturale. But whatever a person decides to do with their body is completely up to them and its certainly not our place to comment on it. This is perhaps why one mum was left feeling rather shocked after two midwives started openly discussing her pubic hair while she was in hospital.  The revelation came as part of a thread on Mumsnet about pubic hair, in which a woman pondered why some people are obsessed with shaving and waxing their lady garden. Hundreds took the time to respond to the original post, sharing their own personal grooming methods. One mum started by saying that she thinks most women completely remove their pubic hair nowadays. She then went on to explain that the reason she thinks this, is because of a bizarre experience she had after giving birth.  The woman claims that while her midwives were stitching up a vaginal tear, they told her they thought her full head of pubic hair was unusual. I think full removal is really common, she wrote. The MWs who stitched up my second degree tear were both discussing my full head and how unusual it was these days. My womens health physio said the same. People on the thread were outraged by her words and slammed the midwives for being so unprofessional.  One said: I hope you told all three of them to shut the f*** up and then reported them to their superiors  Another commented: Agree, it’s not on for them to comment. Also, shaving can cause ingrown hair and infection and that’s not what you think any when pregnant. A third posted: OMG Im due no. in April and I will be mortiedthe MW starts discussing my full bush!

It can really hurt teams,” said Jim.“We didn’t utilise Jesse and Calvin’s pace nearly enough at Hibs but they are still young and they are still learning their positions.“We have that pace, though, andyou take our three midfielders last Saturday, although Paul McGowan doubled up as a striker because of the system we wanted to play, you look at Martin Woods, you look at Glen Kamara you look at Paul McGowan, every one of them can pick a pass.“They are clever players and they can spot a pass, sowe make the runs early enough we can use that.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"south argyll schools reach bowl final","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowSouth Argyll Schoolstravelled to Eastwood High School in Glasgow on Tuesday November  to play in the Scottish Schools Bowl semi-final.The game was played in good conditions and the team were looking forward to building on their recent quarter final performance.The game started with an early converted try for SAS but they were pulled back to - by half time.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta. This was a fitting finish to the Championship at Leuchars with very fast stages and a good test of manand machine in equal measures.Photographs by West Coast Photos."},{"url":null,"title":"speedy kirsty points the way ahead for dad","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAt the age of , Kirsty Mochrie made her first outing as navigator for Innes Mochrie at the  Kingdom Stages rally.Seasoned campaigner Innes, who happens to be Kirsty#s dad, was well guided around the course in their Kilmory Coachworks .Kirsty#s gran Libby told the Advertiser: #She just loved it.

Darren Boyd, of Thornyflat Street in Ayr, admitted to assaulting David Mackie on July  this year at McLean Street in Ayr. He also owned up to uttering threats of violence towards him. Boyd appeared before Sherf Scott Pattison at Ayr Sherf Court last week. The court heard how the -year-old ‘repeatedly punched’ Mr Mackie on the head. Depute Fiscal Andrew Lazzarin explained: “At around pm, the complainers were at their home when they heard a noise and went to see what it was. There was a household item lying in the garden. They went to speak to the neighbour about why this was there. “The accused was in the neighbour’s house and assaulted the complainer by repeatedly punching him on the head. “The complainer then went home and the accused went back into the neighbour’s house. The police were contacted and the complainer had a small cut on his lip - he was taken to AE. “Police were unable to find the accused as he had left the neighbours house at that time. “On another occasion, it seems that the complainers were driving to the locus and the accused was shouting towards them saying, “I am going to kick your c**t in”.  “Police were contacted again about these matters.” Defending Boyd, Tony Currie added that Mr Mackie was the neighbour of his partner and there had been “ongoing issues” between them. He said: “These incidents were because of his partner’s ongoing issues with the complainer. “She was receiving ongoing complaints from them. “He had been at his partner’s house at the moment the complainer came to the door, who was kicking the door and was challenging towards his partner. “She was heavily pregnant at the time.” Mr Currie added that there has been no further issues in the interim and the couple are hoping to relocate. Sherf Pattison said: “I was considering sending you to jail - you need to know that this type of violence cannot continue.” As an alternative to custody, Sherf Pattison ordered Boyd to carry out a community payback order with  hours of unpaid work to be completed in nine months.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13689315.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS170228854.jpg","title":"ayr uniteds somerset park football","story":"NewsAyr Uniteds Somerset Park football ground damaged as car ploughs into turnstilesThe vehicle smashed into historic Somerset Park shortly before pm last night.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsSomerset Park damaged after car crashes into ground\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA football clubs stadium has been badly damaged after a car ploughed straight through its turnstiles.

Chemo treatment is to be axed at either Ayr or Crosshouse Hospital, a health board meeting heard on Monday. Heath bosses at NHS Ayrshire  Arran are considering a huge shake-up of cancer services.  Previously it was proposed Crosshouse Hospital would be home to the cancer unit but bosses insist they are now considering Ayr too. Peter Maclean, clinical director, cancer services, said: “The next stage is to determine where the site will be.” The NHS Ayshire  Arran health board meeting was told a new model for cancer treatment is being proposed across the whole of the West of Scotland. Non-executive board member Ian Welsh said there is concern about moving services away from Ayr. As well as the main cancer unit, new outreach treatment hubs could be available where but they would only cater for low-risk cases. Nurse director Professor Hazel Borland said the outreach service could be located at Ayrshire Central Hospital in Irvine. She added: “For the next  to  months there will be no change. It continues as it is.” Councillor Joe Cullinane raised the issue of consultation and said any change at Ayr would become political. He added: “At the end of the day cancer touches most people’s lives in our community.” Chief executive John Burns said the ambition was to deliver the “best care we can to our population”. He added: “We need to think of it as a pathway, not just a building.” Councillor Laura Brennan-Whitefield wanted more information on the outreach cancer treatment. She said: “There has been a question mark over Ayr Hospital since . For me it is such a big thing.

Alexander MacKenzie, , of Galloway Avenue in Ayr, was caught with a sick collection of illegal material involving animals and others showing children thought to be as young as one-year old. Police discovered the sick creep had a total of approximately  images. One involved two women and a black dog. And images displayed naked kids – the youngest aged between one and three. Ayr Sherf Court heard at an earlier hearing that police carried out a search on September  last year and uncovered a USB stick and HP computer terminal storing MacKenzie’s disgusting collection. Officers attended at the home MacKenzie shares with his elderly mother. She stated he was at work and told officers she only used the computer for online banking. His mum told officers that MacKenzie used the computer everyday – to go online, for Facebook and “something to do with animals”.  Mackenzie, who has a previous conviction, appeared at court last Wednesday for sentencing. Solicitor Chris Munro said: “This is something that has spiralled, causing him to possess the images. “It’s a fairly low volume of images. “This is a matter of possession rather than distribution. “He appreciates these are particularly serious matters and custody may be on your lordship’s mind. “He resides with his mother and Mr Mackenzie is her registered carer. “She clearly would face some problemsMr Mackenzie was sent to prison today. “He has a relatively close bond with his mother.” Sherf Desmond Leslie replied: “[I have] concerns with the previous conviction and the superficial appreciation of the disposal that was made at that time.”  Mr Munro replied: “There is clearly a risk here but that can be managed in the community.” Stepping back from custody, the Sherf imposed a y community payback order. The perv was sentenced to three years supervision and as a requirement must attend the Moving Forward Making Changes programme. He was tagged for nine months where he must remain in his home address from pm - am. And he was also placed on the sex offenders’ register for five years. MacKenzie pled guilty to being in possession of a quantity of extreme pornographic images depicting in an explicit and realistic way bestiality between adults and animals between June ,  and September , . He also admitted having in his possession indecent photos or pseudo-photos of children from June ,  and September , .

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9014455.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"greens-urge-nicola-sturgeon-to-legislate-for-climate-emergency","story":"The party is calling on SNP ministers to strengthen the provisions in its Climate Change .Green co-convener Patrick Harvie made the plea after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon ed from international climate change talks in Poland.His party is calling for the legislation to include a target for Scotland to reach ldquonet zero emissions by , compared to government proposals to cut emissions by at least % by .Greens also want an interim target to cut emissions by % by  and for a ten-point plan setting out ious changes to be produced within a year.These could include increased funding for walking and cycling, more reliable and cheaper public transport and a new tax on single use plastics.Mr Harvie said: ldquoClimate experts are united in saying that we must deliver massive emissions reductions over the next decade or we face climate breakdown.ldquoThere is still time, but we need the Scottish Government to act now to strengthen its Climate Bill, recognising this is a national and global emergency.ldquoCommitting to a timescale for zero emissions can spur new ideas to go beyond whatrsquos currently thought possible.

Despite these challenges, our new target provides a renewed impetus to our widening access activities, which I consider to be a priority area for the university.ldquoAlong with the introduction of several new measures ndash including our plan to promote more opportunities for students from SIMD backgrounds through clearing this is a signicant step in our journey towards greater inclusion.Richard Lochhead, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Minister for Further Education, took part in a discussion with Mr Boyne yesterday which covered the challenges faced by the university in attracting students from widening access backgrounds.Mr Lochhead, said: ldquoI welcome the University of Aberdeenrsquos commitment to recruit more students from disadvantaged backgrounds to this impressive institution.

The MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber continued unchallenged after removing the word ldquoperhaps from his subsequent remarks.In her response, the PM stressed how there was no dference between what Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, had said in a statement to the Commons on Monday and the published legal advice.Later, outwith the chamber, Mr Blackford declared: ldquoItrsquos absolutely conclusive that the PM has misled the House relating to the permanency of the backstop.He replied: ldquoLet us call a spade a spade. On the basishellipshe had the legal advice when she spoke in the House of Commons, then shersquos lied, yes.The published paper from Mr Cox - in bold type - states: ldquoDespite statements in the Protocol that it[the backstop] is not intended to be permanent and the clear intention of the parties that it should be replaced by alternative, permanent arrangements, in international law the Protocol would endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement took its placehellipThe six-page document also said that under the proposed arrangements, \"for regulatory purposes, GB is essentially treated as a third country by NI for goods passing from GB into NI\".Nigel Dodds, the Democratic Unionist Party leader at Westminster, described the legal advice as \"devastating\" and said it made clear the proposed backstop was \"unacceptable\" and must be defeated.Sir Keir Starmer for Labour said the legal advice had confirmed \"the central weaknesses in the Governments deal\".As the PM continued her Commons meetings with Tory MPs, saying she was ldquolistening to the concerns of colleagues about ldquothe way forward, it emerged No  was discussing a plan to give MPs a vote on whether the UK should enter the backstop at all orthe Brexit Plan should be scrapped altogether.But ardent Brexiteer Steve Baker dismissed the Downing St strategy, saying: ldquoIt is silly and few are falling for it.Meanwhile, it was suggested EU chiefs are preparing for a May defeat by putting the issue of extending Article  on the agenda for the December European Council, which takes place two days after next Tuesdayrsquos Commons vote.The continuing row at Westminster came as Holyrood formally voted against both Mrs Mays Brexit deal and the prospect of quitting the EU with no deal in place.MSPs voted by  to  for a motion which said both these options \"would be damaging for Scotland and the nations and regions of the UK as a whole\".As a result, they called for the Brexit deal to be rejected when it is voted on at Westminster on December  and for \"a better alternative be taken forward\".Today, David Mundell will open up a new front in the Brexit row when he calls on Nicola Sturgeon to ldquoopen her ears to Scottish business and back the PMrsquos withdrawal plan.In a speech in London, the Scottish Secretary will say: ldquoIf she genuinely wants to represent Scotlandrsquos views she has to stop lecturing and start listening.ldquoIf she listened, shersquod know we have a workable solution. If she listened, shersquod understand how little appetite there is for simply prolonging the uncertainty. She also claims we must avoid no-deal.

It was full of nettles and less than a metre wide. We managed to enter it and there was a section of boulders ndash we moved them out of the way and then there was a ft drop. That led to a spectacular chamber  yards by  feet ndash big enough to stand up in. The stones were blue and purple. It was some incredible sight.ldquoWe managed to explore  yards before finding the route choked with sediment. We plan towith a team in the New Year to dig it out and explore further.ldquoThe theory and hope is it could extend all the way to Smoo Cave which would make it by far the longest cave in Scotland and with the most spectacular of entrances ndash or exits, depending on the start point ndash at Smoo.Scotlandrsquos longest cave is currently the Cave of the Sloping Rock in nearby Assynt which is . miles long.The longest cave system in the UK is the Three Counties System in the Yorkshire Dales, with . miles of passageway, while the longest in the world is the appropriately-named Mammonth Cave in Brownsville, Kentucky with more than  miles explored.Smoo Cave is the largest coastline cave in the British Isles and has provided shelter for thousands of years. It is believed to have been a Stone Age home more than , years ago with Norse settlers later gathering here to repair boats and fish for herring.It has one of the largest entrances to any sea cave in Britain at  ft high. It was formed by a burn that runs down into the rear chamber, as well as erosion caused by the sea.Mr Greig added: ldquoIf it links up to the new discovery it will be one of the best caving experiences in the UK. It is a treasure trove for geologists. Over the two days we have explored the new cave we even found a white freshwater eel which has never seen sunlight.ldquoThe drought helped us because the cave floods in wet conditions, and up to the roof in places. Itrsquos like a big treasure hunt, but we do not know what the treasure is yet. It is what most cavers dream of. This is the final frontier of exploration in Scotland. Every inch of the country has been mapped by satellite ndash itrsquos what remains under the surface that remains the big mystery.Fellow caver Colin Coventry, who for more than  years has led tours at Smoo Cave, added: ldquoFor many years I have been convinced that Smoo was linked to one long cave. We believe the biggest cave in Scotland is here and waiting to be found.ldquoThis looks like it. But it is spectacularly dangerous.ldquoI would certainly not take tours there.

Golspie is operational   three days a week.\"The writer states that the letter represents the feelings of paramedics and technicians in Easter Ross, and they are calling for six more staff to make Alness and Tain   and ldquogive the residents of Easter Ross a fighting chance in their hour of need\".The Scottish Ambulance Service hit back however. A spokesman said: ldquoThe claims are untrue. We have ambulances working a   sht at Dingwall, Golspie, Lairg, Wick and Thurso ndash a crew is also available at either Tain or Alness stations and often both at the same time, depending on sht patterns.ldquoPatients in this part of Scotland can also rely on the air ambulance helicopter, a team of emergency response doctors based in Tain, Dornoch and Dingwall, and our teams of community first responders to provide an emergency response within a matter of minutes.ldquoWe closely and continuously monitor our staffing levels, through our demand and capacity review, to ensure we can provide safe patient care in all parts of Scotland and continue to invest in our workforce.Contacted for comment, Highlands and Islands Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoStaff have raised concerns with me which I in turn have raised with the ambulance service. I believe that we do require more ambulance resources throughout the Highlands and Islands.ldquoCrews have to travel long distances to transfer patients and with specialist services becoming more centralised that will only increase.ldquoIt is right that crews who are fatigued sign off and ideally we should have more stations covered without the use of on call staff, who are in greater danger of becoming fatiguedthey have already undertaken a long transfer.ldquoI know from SAS that they are using Inverness crews to do some of these transfers where that is clinically safe.ldquoObviously in an emergency the nearest crew must respond.

On the basis of the legal advice, and the fact she had this legal advice when she spoke in the House of Commons, then she’s lied.”Mr Blackford avoided formal censure after twice being rebuked by Mr Bercow during the exchange, but said later he had been prepared to be suspended from the Commons.He said: “I understand there are conventions in the House and we have to be respectful of those conventions, but it’s absolutely conclusive.”Mrs May has repeatedly said the backstop, which will come into forcea trade deal has not been agreed between London and Brussels by December  and would keep the UK under EU customs rules, will be “only temporary”.: Scottish Parliament votes to reject Theresa May’s Brexit dealLegal advice provided to the Cabinet and published yesterday warns the UK could be stuck in “protracted and repeating rounds of negotiations” with no lawful power to exit.And it makes clear that Brussels could apply to an arbitration  for Northern Ireland to remain in the EU customs area while the rest of the UK left.The six-page document by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox was released to MPs a day after the House of Commons found the Government in contempt of Parliament for trying to keep it secret.Democratic Unionist Party leader Nigel Dodds described the advice as “devastating” and said it made clear Mrs May’s deal was “unacceptable” and must be defeated.The Prime Minister rejected Mr Blackford’s claim the Government had been “concealing the facts on her Brexit deal”, insisting the document contained the same information as a statement made to MPs by Mr Cox earlier this week.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the document revealed “the central weaknesses in the Government’s deal” and will also be seized upon by critics of Mrs May’s deal in her own party.Tory former chief whip Mark Harper warned the deal would collapse his party’s confidence and supply agreement with the DUP and leave them “unable to govern”.In his advice, Mr Cox found the protocol setting out the terms of the backstop “does not provide for a mechanism that is likely to enable the UK lawfully to exit the UK-wide customs union without a subsequent agreement”.: Scotland has room to tax high earners more says Derek Mackay“This remains the case evenparties are still negotiating many years later and eventhe parties believe that talks have clearly broken down and there is no prospect of a future relationship agreement,” he added.Under the arrangements, “for regulatory purposes GB is essentially treated as a third country by NI for goods passing from GB into NI”, he said.Despite assurances from both London and Brussels that it is intended to be temporary, Mr Cox said the protocol would “endure indefinitely” under international law until another agreement takes its place.The UK would have no legal means of compelling the EU to end any such agreement.The Attorney General warned: “In the absence of a right of termination, there is a legal risk the United Kingdom might become subject to protracted and repeating rounds of negotiations.“This risk must be weighed against the political and economic imperative on both sides to reach an agreement that constitutes a politically stable and permanent basis for their future relationship.“This is a political decision.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4839946.1544034461!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit s causes would remain even if it s prevented malcolm bruce","story":"The UK needs to find ways to improve the lives of justiably angry people who voted for Brexit, writes Liberal Democrat peer Malcolm Bruce.The Brexit referendum opened deep isions within the UK between those who feel ignored, frustrated and forgotten, and an apparently indferent establishment.Globalisation has left many better off. However, it has also led to rapid change which, for many people, has meant the decline of their communities whose economic reason to exist has moved where. We may have record numbers in employment, but many people find themselves stuck in low-paid, insecure jobs. People are angry, and justiably so. People have seen their pay cut and opportunities diminish while those driving the economy got richer even when it was their decisions had made millions poorer. The excesses of capitalism must be addressed. We must enact economic reforms to ensure a fairer society. Liberal democracy is based on markets, free trade and free enterprise. But these need to be servants, not masters of a liberal society. One major issue is the UK economy is consumer driven. We inflate the value of our real estate, borrow against these assets and buy goods and services which mostly we don’t produce.One way to tackle this would be to introduce land-value taxation. This would not only discourage speculative land hoarding, but it is an initial step in introducing taxes on wealth rather than income. It ensures that those iniduals with high-value net worth contribute fairly to the community. Land and property speculation should no longer be the principal driver of our economy.In Germany, their economy is driven by investmentand skills and company ownership is held more through direct investors and workers, rather than institutional shareholders looking for short-term gains. The Liberal Democrats have long called for workers representative on boards, the encouragement of worker share ownership, and partnerships and supervisory boards with wider responsibilities than just shareholder . Liberal Democrats believe that it is vital that everyone is given a stake in our economy, that we can only be united and competitive as a countrythe rewards are reaped by all.: Brexit deal will cost us £bn, says Nicola SturgeonThe UK still suffers tension between the roles of the state and the private sector, instead of the promotion of creative partnership. People are also being confronted with utilities raising prices ahead of inflation whilst delivering poor service. Rail services are equally expensive and unreliable.To answer this, Labour has revitalised its Marxist-Leninist credentials and is proposing wholesale nationalisation. To a younger generation with no memory of the Soviet Union or the tussles over Clause  of the Labour Party constitution, it might seem attractive to bring gas, electricity, water and the railways back into public ownership.After all, wouldn’t that mean fuel bills would be kept down and the trains would run on time with lower fares  Not necessarily. British Rail was famous for dreadful food, poor timekeeping and under-investment.How would Labour pay for the shares and how would utilities and railways secure funding in competition with health, education, and welfare  Seizing the assets would destroy investment and collapse pension funds. It would be far better to give consumers and rail passengers a more direct role in the running of these companies, rather than having to own them.: Police Scotland officers could be sent to Northern Ireland during BrexitMuch of the inequality in the United Kingdom can be attributed to where you live. Therefore, it is vital we unlock the positive energy of our communities. In Scotland, having our own Parliament with signicant powers gives us control of our domestic affairs to address our distinctive needs and culture. We should be using those powers to pursue policies to improve our quality of le and strengthen our economy, which remains too dependent on the public sector. That does not mean we should cut public sector funding or privatise sectors. Rather we should seek to grow the private sector and with it the tax base.However, we have seen over the past year what little regard the Conservative Government has for devolving powers. The Brexit process has been abused with powers being taken to Whitehall that should have been devolved. The loss of £. billion of European Structural and Investment Funds is only likely to make the problems faced by disadvantaged areas worse. Local authorities must have their powers and sources of funding guaranteed. Local autonomy with real financial muscle is the only sustainable answer to the regional ide. That is why the Government must support our call to devolve more decision-making power over key levers of economic development including transport, housing and skills. We must do more to tackle regional inequality where you are born should not affect your chance of prosperity.All of this makes clear that it is time for a new People’s Contract. We must end the politics of ision, espoused in ious forms by the Tories, Labour and the SNP and bring the country together. When looking at the referendum vote, we must not only call for a People’s Vote to end the Brexit chaos in the short term, but we must address why people voted leave in the first place. If we are to achieve a fairer, less ided society we must reform our economy so that everyone has the means to get by and the chance to get on.Malcolm Bruce is the Liberal Democrat’s spokesperson for Northern Ireland  Scotland in the House of Lords©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4839963.1544038398!/image/image.jpg","title":"scots no more open to immigration than rest of uk study finds","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Attitudes towards immigration in Scotland are broadly the same as those in the rest of the UK, a study has found.Overall, more people across the UK think immigration is good for the British economy than believe it is bad, analysis authored by Sir John Curtice found.The study by NatCen Social Research, based on the most recent British and Scottish Social Attitudes surveys, found little evidence that public opinion in Scotland is any more liberal towards immigration than in England and Wales.However, the study does suggest that independence supporters have a more positive view of immigration than people who voted to stay in the UK in the  referendum.Among Yes voters,  per cent feel British culture is undermined by immigration while  per cent believe it is enriched, compared to  per cent of No voters who feel British culture is undermined and  per cent who say it is enriched.Broken down by party affiliation,  per cent of Labour voters in Scotland think that migration is good for Britain’s economy, compared with  per cent in England and Wales. A total of  per cent of Scottish Conservative voters feel that immigration is good for the economy compared to  per cent south of the Border.Sir John said there did not appear to be any consistent link in Scotland between identity and perceptions of the economic consequences of migration.He said SNP voters in  holding positive views about migration helped create the impression Scotland as a whole did as well.But Sir John argued those Scots who supported other parties were less positive about immigration.“Consequently, although the balance of opinion about migration is much the same in Scotland as in the rest of Britain, the link between attitudes towards the subject and how people vote at election time is somewhat dferent north of the Border,” he said.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4828116.1544030057!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish parliament votes to reject theresa may s brexit deal","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Scottish Parliament has voted to reject Prime Minister Theresa May#s Brexit deal amid claims it will leave parts of the country #severely and permanently damaged#.SNP, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens voted in favour of a motion calling for a “better alternative” to be found.Brexit Secretary Mike Russell said the debate was an “historic opportunity” for the Scottish Parliament to come together with a unied voice in opposition to the EU withdrawal agreement and also the prospect of a no-deal.: Brexit: Theresa May accused of misleading Commons by SNP over legal adviceWhile the vote is merely symbolic, it puts on record Holyrood’s opposition to the path set out by the Prime Minister.Mr Russell said a reduction in EU migrants would damage the Scottish economy and make it “considerably harder” for legal and financial sector firms to deal with Europe.He said: “In every area of Scotland there are businesses, organisations, communities and iniduals who will suffer, directly suffer, over a long period of timethis deal is approved.“This deal is not even the end of uncertainty. That is just another  promise.“In fact the uncertainty flowing from the Prime Minister’s deal would last until the end of the transition period, which will not be in December , no-one believes that, more likely December  or even later.“That’s at least four years of uncertainty to add to the two-and-a-half we’ve already had.”He added: “Scotland needs and deserves better than the Prime Minister’s blindfold Brexit.“For in truth this deal is about saving the Prime Minister, not about saving her country.”But Conservative MSP Adam Tomkins said the Prime Minister’s deal was the only credible proposal to have been tabled since the EU referendum.He said: “Either we leave the EU on the basis of the orderly withdrawal agreement that the Prime Minister and her team have negotiated, or something very close to it, or we crash out of the EU on a no-deal basis that would be a disaster for the economy.”: SNP blame ‘toxic’ Tory Government for stirring up anti-immigrant feelingHe said the motion put forward by the other parties to oppose the withdrawal plans and a no-deal Brexit is “just noise” and rejecting the withdrawal agreement makes a no-deal Brexit more likely.“We want a better alternative, says the motion, without any clue as to what that alternative would be and how could possibly be delivered,” he said.He accused the SNP of trying to “weaponise” Brexit in the service of independence and said Labour and the Liberal Democrats have been “hoodwinked” into giving their support.Labour’s Neil Findlay said the Prime Minister’s deal was “doomed” and called for a general election.He said the overwhelming feeling was “uncertainty” and accused the Conservatives of bringing in “utter chaos” through the EU referendum.He said: “For the sake of the country, our economy, our jobs, our children, our environment and the rights we enjoy the Prime Minister should admit the game is up and let democracy prevail in a general election.”MSPs voted - in favour of the motion.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4839405.1543952021!/image/image.jpg","title":"tourist route the north coast 500 is beautiful but do locals love it","story":"On a trip that began as a tribute to Edwin Muir#s Scottish Journey, James McEnaney found the NC was not without its bumpsI was never the wee boy who wanted to be a footballer or a fireman or a racing car driver. The only thing I can remember always wanting to do, at every age and stage, through every phase and passing fascination, was write.And then, at the age of , I finally got the chance to produce a book. I had been inspired by Edwin Muir’s Scottish Journey, a fascinating piece of work – part travelogue, part polemic – which I had first encountered in . I was , a newly-qualied English teacher at Arran High School, and had been handed the challenge of teaching the Advanced Higher curriculum. I immediately fell in love with the book and thought even then that a modern version could make a worthwhile contribution to contemporary Scotland – although I did not for a second ever think I’d have the chance to make it happen.The first big job was planning the route, which was a long, complicated and frustrating process. In its earliest incarnations, the journey was an attempt to replicate Muir’s movements eight decades earlier, following the same twists and turns, and finding the same stopping-off points, as the man himself. However, I realised that, in this form, my work could only ever be an echo – an inescapably pale imitation of a great, though under-appreciated, piece of writing.After this realisation, my plans mutated – an extra village here, a bypassed motorway there – until I finally settled on a project that was really mine. My Scottish Journey would use the Scottish Parliament as the start and end points for a ten-day, clockwise, broadly coastal loop of the country in the spring of . Where Muir travelled alone in a borrowed Standard car, I’d be on a -year-old motorbike. Instead of hotels and BBs, I would stay with local people in places including Gatehouse of Fleet, Ullapool and Aberdeen, incorporating their thoughts and feelings about their homes and gathering up, to borrow Muir’s phrase, my own “bundle of impressions”.Over those ten days I experienced Scotland’s incredible, infectious beauty in all its hues, from sparkling waters beneath the brightest, bluest skies to prehistoric peaks shrouded in gathering storm clouds. Wrong turns introduced me to a millennium-old site of worship on Orkney and the beautul Art Deco remains of Tarlair’s enchanting outdoor swimming pool, while recommendations I picked up along the road took me to a location from film The Wicker Man and the best hot chocolate I have ever tasted. I visited an amazing outdoor nursery on the west coast, and in the east was introduced to long-forgotten artwork left behind by Polish airmen during the Second World War.Best of all, in every corner of the country, I met generous, warm-hearted people, many of whom had been born where but found a home in Scotland, who were willing to share their passions, their stories and, in many cases, their homes with me. It was a privilege, and one for which I will always be grateful.So much of what I saw during my journey surprised me. I didn’t expect the brutal snow storm on day two which very nearly ended my trip, or my emotional response to the Orcadian island of Wyre, where I stood in Muir’s boyhood home. I hadn’t anticipated the anger I felt in Helmsdale, in Sutherland, standing beside The Emigrants statue remembering those forced from their homes during The Clearances. Matters of local democracy and the alienation felt by many of Scotland’s communities became consistent threads running through the fabric of my story, despite my insistence that I did not want to write a political book.I had realised during the planning stage that I would be covering the majority of Scotland’s shiny new “ultimate road trip”, the North Coast . Like everyone  I was aware of the increasing buzz around this initiative – a few friends had already completed the trip, and in  the journalist Peter Ross had written a typically wonderful piece about it for National Geographic. Having only ever completed isolated sections before I was looking forward to experiencing the whole route for myself and hoped I might be able to tell my own version of what appears to be a quite incredible success story. But the reality that I encountered was very dferent from the rhetoric.Day five of my adventure began with an early departure from Geary in the north of Skye, with an ultimate destination just south of Ullapool to be reached by early evening. I arrived in Lochcarron, ready to cross the famous Bealach na Ba towards Applecross, just before lunchtime and decided to stop for a cup of tea and some fuel. I had only joined the North Coast  route a few minutes earlier but already couldn’t miss it: outside the Lochcarron Hotel stood two huge advertising flags and even here, in this tiny West Highland village clinging to the shoreline, I had several opportunities to part with my cash in exchange for a iety of route-related merchandise.I had lunch at the Applecross Inn where I spoke to Alison Macleod, a community development worker, who told me about le on this beautul, isolated peninsula. She spoke honestly and passionately, and offered some pretty cutting observations about the local council, the Scottish Government and ious infrastructure companies, all of which have failed communities like hers in a iety of ways.But she reserved particularly harsh words for the North Coast , saying: “It’s been awful. The whole thing has been a nightmare.”She wasn’t alone in expressing serious reservations about the purported benefits of this new tourist draw. My hosts that evening were Ailsa McLellan and her partner Joe Hayes, whose driveway joins directly onto one of the many roads that makes up the route. They echoed Alison’s criticisms, highlighting above all the lack of appropriate infrastructure of investment to make such a scheme sustainable even in the medium – never mind long term. The ultimate fear is a simple one: that carelessness will transform these amazing, must-see nooks and crannies of our country into over-crowded, over-exploited shells that travellers decide aren’t worth the hassle.These sorts of concerns have been echoed in a number of conversations I have had since writing the book, and have reinforced some of the thoughts I had at the time. In some places – such as along the northern coast of the Applecross peninsula, or the stretch of road around Drumbeg – the narrow and contorted Tarmac presented a challenge even on two wheels. While negotiating some of the particularly uncompromising sections I remember wondering how large cars, never mind tour buses and American-style campervans, could possibly cope – and how bad things could gettwo people with no experience of passing places met head on.It is easy to understand the appeal of “Scotland’s Route ” and there’s no denying that it showcases some of the very best that Scotland has to offer. For many people, that -mile northern loop, carving through scenery which, at times, seems able to transcend the very idea of beauty, will be unlike anything they have previously experienced. We live in an astonishing corner of the planet and should be proud to show it off, but in the rush to celebrate success we also risk forgetting, as we so often do in Scotland, that apparently “remote” areas are still the centre of the world for the people who actually live there, and not just a holiday playground for the rest of us.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the table as attempts were made to break the deadlock.There is further good news with confirmation that HLH swimming lessons for children and aquafit will also resume.Details of the funding arrangements

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year.

The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

Unlike the pro-Remain parties, there was no joint press conference. But in separate statements, the DUP, the Ulster Unionists and the TUV insisted that no unionist worth their salt could sign up to the deal and called for the backstop to be binned. Sometimes, a secret document doesnt live up to the speculation. This was not such an occasion.Geoffrey Coxs advice set off alarm bells in even moderate unionist circles. No wonder the Government wanted to keep it under wraps. It said the whole of the UK would form a single customs territory with the EU, but Northern Ireland and Britain would be there on dferent legal terms.Only Northern Ireland would be legally part of the customs union, following the full EU customs code. The European Court of Justice would continue to have jurisdiction over its compliance with those rules. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: \"Goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to a declaration process.\"Northern Ireland will remain in the single market for goods and the EUs customs regime, and will be required to apply and comply with the relevant rules and standards,up regulatory ergence in the future.\"Britain would be \"essentially treated as a third country by Northern Ireland for goods passing from GB into NI\".The DUP is livid that despite all Mrs Mays pledges, economic and trade barriers would be erected within the UK - something it branded \"unacceptable and economically mad\". The legal advice said the backstop could continue indefinitely and that the drafting didnt provide for a mechanism that is likely to allow the UK to exit lawfully.Despite promises to the contrary from Mrs May and Secretary of State Karen Bradley, the TUV said Northern Ireland would be \"annexed permanently into the EU\".The Attorney Generals full advice, released yesterday, was \"more emphatic and plain than that dressed up for the summary\" in the House of Commons on Monday, Mr Allister said.\"The trap is clear. All of the UK for now is held in a customs territory with the EU but only Northern Ireland is legally part of the EU Customs Union, where we would stay indefinitely evenGB was released,\" he added.\"This is utterly incompatible with the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK.\"Mrs May had previously stated the very arrangement that she ended up signing up to would be unacceptable to any UK Prime Minister.Mr Swann said while the Government tried to downplay unionist concerns as recently as last week when he met the Prime Minister and Cabinet Office officials, legal advice reinforcing those fears was actually sitting on their desks.\"What was the point in them spending the best part of a year saying that they shared our concernsall the while they were negotiating a deal that contains everything we were concerned about \" he asked.The UUP leader said Mrs May must stop \"flogging this dead deal\" and pursue alternatives. But nationalist parties and Alliance want her to do nothing of the sort. Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy said the backstop had been agreed by the Government and the EU, and the Attorney Generals advice changed nothing. \"It must be maintained and protected. It cant be derailed or undermined by the votes of Brexiteer MPs,\" he stressed.An SDLP spokesperson added: \"There will potentially be minor dferences between GB and NIthe backstop is required, but they will be minimal.\"This is not a secret, but any ergence is a consequence of Brexit and the extreme version of Brexit that the DUP insisted on pursuing. If the DUP cannot accept this consequence of Brexit, they should do the honourable thing and support a referendum on the deal.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said nobody should be shocked at the legal advice on the backstop, because \"its nature and purpose should have been evident to anyone following the negotiations over the past  months\".The backstop was needed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border, he insisted. Mr Farry didnt see it undermining the Union - it \"may create comparative economic advantages for this region\", he said."},{"url":null,"title":"backstop is totally unacceptable to unionists and must be defeated says dodds","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Why has she allowed that to be used as a negotiating ploy by the EU against the United Kingdom ,\" Mr Campbell asked.Mrs May rejected Mr Campbells comments saying that the people of Northern Ireland needed a commitment that there would be no hard border and that a political assertion was not enough."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit would uk membership of the eea work","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

BelfastBrexit survey: Have your say and you could win a £ Amazon voucher UUP leader Robin Swann said his party was prepared to look at all the alternatives to Theresa Mays \"unacceptable\" current deal but he stressed that any solution must be \"UK-wide\".Sinn Fein said the DUP couldnt negotiate their own agreement and there already was a Brexit deal on the table. NI boss is called ‘Tory cow’ for May support Speaking to BBC Radio s Today programme yesterday, Mrs Foster said she would not support calls for a second Brexit referendum, as the UK had already voted to leave and \"we respect that\". Repeating the DUPs opposition to Mrs Mays deal, she urged the Prime Minister to \"not waste time\" on it and instead look for a better solution to the border question.She hinted thatthe current Withdrawal Agreement failed to get through the House of Commons, her party could be open to a Norway plus style arrangement, where the whole of the UK stayed in the customs union until an agreement with the EU is reached on future trading relations. Would membership of the EEA work  Ms Foster said the DUPs \"one red line\" was to make sure Northern Ireland was not dferentiated from the rest of the UK in terms of customs and was \"not prescriptive\" about other potential options on the future relationship with the EU.But a Norway plus-style arrangement has been rejected by the TUV leader.Mr Allister told the Belfast : \"It would retain us fully within the EU single market, subject to all Brussels-made rules - adjudicated by the European Court of Justice - and maintain free movement of labour and require ongoing payments to the EU. That is not Brexit. Brexit: Ulster Farmers Union remain amenable to alternate Withdrawal Agreement proposal \"But for us it would be worse, because the Norway plus that is being talked about would additionally keep Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU - completing the repudiation of the Brexit that was voted for. Thus, the backstop would essentially still apply.\"Mr Allister continued: \"The core of the backstop is that Northern Ireland alone remains part of the customs territory of the EU.\"With the EU likely to only agree a Norway-style deal which had this add-on, it would leave us incarcerated in the EU in perpetuity.\"The UUP did not appear to rule out a Norway plus style arrangement. Mr Swann said: \"The Ulster Unionist Party cannot give our support to the Withdrawal Agreement and its disastrous backstop. However, we will look at every option and assess its merits - but the bottom line for the Ulster Unionist Party is that any solution must be UK-wide in its entirety.\"Sinn Fein MLA Mairtin O Muilleoir said: \"There already is a deal on the table - its not perfect but it avoids physical infrastructure on the border.\"The DUP cannot negotiate their own deal. Nor can they back a deal that isnt there.\"The EU has recognised that a unique solution is needed for the north because of our historical and geographical concerns. The backstop recognises that - that must be maintained.\"Mrs Foster told Radio  that Mrs Mays deal would see Northern Ireland \"erge off from the United Kingdom\" and she urged the Prime Minister to \"look for a better deal\" that \"takes back control of our money, of our borders and of our laws\".The DUP leader said: \"All the things that made us vote for Brexit are the things that are going to be imposed on Northern Ireland.\"Reiterating that the DUPs  MPs would not back the Withdrawal Agreement on December , Mrs Foster said it would create a \"huge democratic deficit\" in Northern Ireland.Mrs May yesterday rejected a suggestion that the failure to get a deal with the EU would see the UK stuck with the Northern Ireland backstop plan permanently.She was responding to Andrew Murrison, the Tory MP and chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, who compared it to a \"post-war pre-fab\".He said: \"Its sold as temporary, its built to last, and its likely to outlive us all.\"However, the PM dismissed his comments and told the House of Commons Liaison Committee it would only ever be a temporary solution.She added: \"Neither side thinks the backstop is a good place to be.\"Mrs May admitted that it would not be possible for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from it, though. But she said this was a guarantee to the people of Northern Ireland there would never be a hard border in place.Mrs May also rejected the claim that passing her Brexit deal in Parliament without the DUPs support would lead to the end of her partnership with Mrs Fosters party.\"Actually, the DUP have themselves said that the confidence-and-supply agreement remains in place,\" she stated.Mrs May refused to be drawn on what would happenMPs down the Withdrawal Agreement.

The print industry is developing very fast and becoming increasingly technologically advanced, so the future will require staff with a strong background in STEM subjects.“While my male colleagues are great, it would be fantastic for all companies to engage with more women. I’m glad I work for a company which encourages me as a young woman in STEM. It’s very rewarding to be part of a business which is always changing, adapting and expanding.

The initiative highlights those local businesses helping young people into work as well as informing young people about the companies and industries.Gavin Killeen, Managing Director of Nuprint, said Lauren was a “shining example of a female in a male-dominated print industry excelling and embracing STEM.”He added: “Eager to learn new skills and increase her expertise in print, Lauren is undaunted by the challenges we constantly throw her way. With her positive attitude, ability to work under pressure and her clear thinking, she embodies Nuprint’s values and has now set a high standard for all our apprentices, both female and male.

The latter opened last year at a cost of poundm.ldquoSuch facilities are important in the provision of sport and recreation, especially to young people who are just starting out in their sporting activities, the council chairman continued.ldquoFacilities like the Down Leisure Centre provide a gathering place around which social activities occur. They provide a sense of pride of place and belonging that can add value to community and indeed the entire district.ldquoThe council is committed that all people in Newry, Mourne and Down enjoy good health and wellbeing via the districtrsquos community plan and that the lsquoBe Activersquo campaign is a superb way to help support this outcome.Cllr Murnin added: ldquoA healthy and active lestyle contributes positively to physical, mental and social wellbeing and as an organisation we want to encourage all our citizens to be active every day.Council officials are delighted with the new centre and the initial reaction of the public to date.One of the key features is the teaching pool which will allow the new centre to provide more swimming classes and education training for teachers, allowing full access to the main pool for other swimmers.Mains gas has also been connected to the new multi-million pound building which also boasts a combined heat and power source, helping minimise its carbon footprint. Photovoltaic cells which have been fitted on the roof help heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas.In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns it into warm air, while so-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building, with everyone associated with the new centre, from the designers to builders and the councillors who supported it financially, delighted at the opening of a new chapter in the history of local leisure provision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget on the ball helping families dealing with dementia  ","story":"BALLYGALGET GAC has been recognised for its effort in helping people who live with dementia in an award ceremony recently.John Mitchelrsquos GAC received the award after teaming up with the Alzheimerrsquos Society to become the first GAA club to take on the Dementia Friendly programme.This award recognises the work members do to ensure everyone affected with dementia in their parish and beyond gets the support they need.Brendan Birt, a spokesperson for the club, explained that the club had been crossing every cultural and religious ide since it was founded in .He said that in that time the club had attended to the needs of everyone who live in what is a very rural part of the Ards Peninsula.ldquoWe are delighted to win this award in recognition of the work that has been done by our club and in the community, he remarked.ldquoThe first initiative of our new award-winning health and wellbeing centre was to become a dementia friendly community. We already have  trained dementia friends and that is growing.ldquoAs the first GAA club, we wanted to get involved because of the many people within our community who are living with dementia. This has raised the profile and understanding of dementia within our club and parish.Although this project is in its infancy, two dementia friendly community workshops have already been delivered creating  dementia friends, not only in Ballygalget but in the surrounding areas too.Future plans include extending the dementia friends initiative to two neighbouring GAA clubs and to hold a workshop in the local primary school.Bernadine McCrory, Country Director for Alzheimerrsquos Society, said: ldquoIt is amazing that John Mitchelrsquos GAC has won the Championing Diversity award and it is a testament to their tremendous work they do.ldquoThe level of nominations received this year was truly phenomenal and there were some exceptional stories heard at the awards ceremony.ldquoWe want everyone affected by dementia to know that whoever you are, whatever you are going through, you can turn to Alzheimerrsquos Society for support, help and advice.She added: ldquoAll the finalists and winners at the Dementia Friendly Awards have demonstrated how we can unite against dementia and support those affected by the condition..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch edge derby tie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an ugly derby win in front of a large home crowd and banished a few memories from the three defeats to Banbridge last season which cost them promotion.The home side were almost at full strength, with Peter Nelson at full back, Kyle McCall ing in the front row and Johnny McPhillips sprung from the bench in the second half. Conor Kelly was the only signicant absentee, with Richard Reaney taking his place on the wing.Banbridge were without most of their Ulster contingent, fielding the team which had propelled them through the leagues over the past few seasons, and they will feel that they should have beaten a jittery home side.Defence dominated an attritional match and both sides were guilty of giving away penalties when in strong positions. Nelson kicked his side into the lead after five minutes, following a positive start, but Banbridge cranked up the pressure and had an excellent ten minute spell. They were held up over the line following some excellent driving play and continued to pile on the pressure, a charge down leading to a succession of m scrums. Despite some heroic defence, Banbridge scored when Stevie Irvine was driven over in the nd minute.Ballynahinch followed this with their best spell of the match, with excellent carrying from forwards and backs, pinning Banbridge in their own . When it seemed they had finally stretched the Bann defence to the limit, a knock-on gave the away side some respite.As lsquoHinch began to build another wave of attacks, scrum half Rhys OrsquoDonnell spotted a gap around the ruck in the centre of the pitch and ran under the posts untouched for an excellent try.Nelsonrsquos simple conversion made it -, but lsquoHinch failed to push on and there was more defending to before half-time. Banbridge missed a penalty just before the break and the home side turned round with a narrow three-point cushion.McPhillips replaced Hilton Gibbons at half-time and knocked over an excellent penalty early in the second half to stretch the lead to six points. However, Banbridge had already shown their intention to move the ball and they looked increasingly dangerous with ball in hand, especially from scrums.Centre Andy Morrison looked dangerous every time he received the ball and Banbridge upped the tempo with lsquoHinch looking increasingly nervous. A yellow card for number  Conall Boomer in the rd minute following a collapsed maul invited pressure and only sensational home defence with  men kept them out.The home try line was eventually breached in the th minute when Morrison went over following a missed tackle in midfield. The missed conversion gave Hinch a leline and despite more pressure form a superbly well drilled Banbridge team the final score remained -. Relief rather than elation from the home supporters as they made their way home.Ballynahinch Banbridge AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Chairman gives his backing to ‘green’ off road paths scheme  ","story":"A CAMPAIGN to connect Downpatrick with the Rowallane area via a series of off-road paths has secured the backing of the districtrsquos first citizen.A delegation of residents met recently with Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin to discuss extending the existing Quoile River walk towards Killyleagh. A motion on the issue will be tabled at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authority.The council chairman was presented with a consultancy report on the merits of the proposal and the minor costings of delivering the scheme which have not yet been made public.The delegation was led by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who was joined by David Flinn, from the Ulster Ramblers Association.The report on extending the existing Quoile River walk into Rowallane was commissioned by the Downpatrick-based Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, which was represented at the meeting by Anthony Trainor.Also taking part was Peter Smyth from the Downpatrick Community Collective, a body which represents all community and residentsrsquo associations in the town. It is also supporting the proposed initiative.Cllr Enright described the off-road paths proposal as a ldquosimple, affordable and detailed plan to restore linkages lost in the s and s.He continued: ldquoIt has long been the desire of all political parties to restore the Ulster Way and reconnect Killyleagh, Delamont Country Park, Downpatrick, Castle Ward and Strangford.ldquoImplementing the reported does not require actual money at all, but simply the local council using its powers under the Countryside Order to remove some of the obstructions that have grown up in recent years.Cllr Enright said the network of paths would reconnect Delamont and Castle Ward with Downpatrick. He explained the route would require two or three short sections of boardwalk similar to those near the Belfast Road to reconnect paths or overcome boggy ground.ldquoAll this needs is a resolute approach by council management to reflect cross-party consensus over the priority of this project, he added.Cllr Murnin said the loss of official Ulster Way status in  for an area stretching from Killyleagh to Downpatrick and from Downpatrick to Strangford was a ldquohuge blow to East Down.He continued: ldquoSince then, local authority staff have intended to re-assert off-load links to recreate these vital routes, but this project has not been prioritised.ldquoWe can re-establish East Down as the centre of a network of off-road community trails that would be both regionally and nationally signicant. I will be lending my support to the cross-party motion in council to prioritise these three inter-linked routes.Mr Smyth said funding for the off-road paths study was obtained though the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, with the project supported by the Downpatrickrsquos Collective which surveyed hundreds of users of existing pathways around Delamont and the Quoile River.He added: ldquoThere is clearly overwhelming public support for this proposal that would cost a small fraction of the money recently invested in providing so-called greenways in the Newry, Warrenpoint and South Armagh areas to link into the Cooley mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Congratulations all round at Saintfield High School  ","story":"SIXTY years of providing outstanding education are being celebrated at Saintfield High School.The school proudly opened its doors in  as Saintfield Secondary Intermediate School with  pupils and five teachers.The school has seen many changes, including extensions and additions, the subjects offered to pupils, the ied members of staff and, of course, the generations of pupils.Miss Sarah-Lucy Hynds, principal, said the th anniversary was being marked ldquowith a real sense of pride in our past, and an excited and positive outlook for the future.She continued: ldquoIt is an absolute honour and privilege to lead such a thriving and active school community a school with a highly commended academic, pastoral, sporting and cultural history.The school has been instrumental in the development of the wider community during the last  years mdash in the citizens that it has produced and in the many and ied achievements of pupils, both past and present.Mr Johnston Young was appointed as the schoolrsquos first principal in .

When he was included in the play, he was absolutely lethal and too hot for Killough to handle.Alas, Killough were masters of their own downfall. They had the major share of possession throughout a feisty encounter, but were never going to be as ruthless as Celtic up front with too many chiefs in midfield and not enough Indians up front and any time they did threaten, goalkeeper Nathan Curran was there to deny them.Celtic started in a hurry and were - up after only four minutes. Stevie Galbraith, who led the line with distinction, linked up with McCoubrey out on the left before cutting inside Chris Fryer.He had only one thing on his mind as he entered the box and an angled right-footed curler, that seemed to take a bit of a deflection, beat Gerard Gormley all ends up.Killough tried desperately to get back on level terms and with seven minutes gone they went close when Fryer let loose from just outside the box. Curran did well to take the sting out of the shot and did even better to retrieve the loose ball ahead of the lurking Tony McIlhone.Two minutes later at the other end a McCoubrey cross was met at the back post by Sean McMahon, but he failed to get a good connection with his head and the chance was wasted.With  minutes gone the same combination dovetailed perfectly again, but McMahonrsquos cross hit the crossbar. McCoubrey was back in the thick of things minutes later when he had a shot well saved by Gormley, but Killough continued to threaten at the opposite end as well with McIlhone again being denied by Curran.Killough were starting to edge midfield and with  minutes gone Curran prevented Liam Graham from equalising after a tidy pass from Michael Burns. Just as Killough started to believe they could get back into the game, they shot themselves in the foot.As they dithered at the back, getting the ball forward, Celticrsquos pressing game bore fruit and McCoubrey took full advantage to race away and beat Gormley with a clinical strike.Four minutes into the second half McCoubrey made it - after Galbraith picked him out with a delightful pass that split Killough wide open.The exciting teenager could have added to his tally on a couple of occasions as Killough gamely tried to get back into contention, but he was out of luck with two cheeky efforts that went narrowly wide.McCoubrey eventually completed his hat-trick in the th minute when Celtic again caught Killough napping at the back and there was only going be one outcome when the talented youngster raced through to beat Gormley.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Sean Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Michael Rice, Jordan Curran, Jordan McCoubrey, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan, Subs: Terence Bell, Caolain Boyd, Andy Baggley.Killough: Gerard Gormley, Chris Fryer, Conor Black, Michael Burns, Colm Stranney, Kevin Groves, Liam Graham, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George, Jack McLaughlin.

A comprehensive design scheme would also have to be worked up.NI Water officials have also confirmed Saintfield is one of a number of towns across the Province which requires signicant investment to upgrade the existing infrastructure to carter for current and future demand.Rowallane politicians fear the moratorium on new development in Saintfield could potentially be in place for two years and have urged senior NI Water officials to do all they can to expedite the work that is required. They say the current ban will not only have a major impact on residents and developers, but the townrsquos economy.NI Waterrsquos Stephen Blockwell confirmed to Newry, Mourne and Down councillors that the drainage study will not be completed until next December. He said the study will look at the causes of the current issues in Saintfield and outline solutions.Pointing to sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road, Mr Blockwell, NI Waterrsquos head of investment, said the study was part of NI Waterrsquos approach to wastewater capacity and described it as a tool ldquoto get timely solutions.Mr Blockwell continued: ldquoIn terms of the drainage plan we need to get the right analysis to come up with solutions and the model we are working on will be ready in December . It takes time to do this work and analysis and get the right solution. If there is available funding, we will be able to bring schemes forward.ldquoThere are under capacity issues across Northern Ireland in relation to wastewater treatment works but there are parts of the Saintfield area like Darragh Cross where development is not restricted.Mr Blockwell added: ldquoUnfortunately for some current residents in Saintfield when there is heavy rainfall, there is restricted toilet use. This is very unpleasant and we sympathise with them. We will work to ensure everything is in place to develop a solution to this issue.Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews have urged officials to ensure that the study is not only completed on time, but that money to implement its ious recommendations is available. They argue it is not unrealistic to suggest that the development ban could be in place for up to two years.ldquoIt is very concerning that work on the study will not be completed for another  months with no guarantee that the money needed to provide a st century sewerage system in Saintfield will be available, said Cllr Walker.ldquoThis is a very serious issue and one that must be urgently addressed. The ban is impinging on the future development of one of this districtrsquos leading towns and we currently have situation during heavy rain that raw sewage is backing up into peoplersquos gardens.Cllr Walker said it was his understanding that Saintfield is one of  towns in Northern Ireland which requires major investment to upgrade sewage treatment plants and the sewerage network.He added: ldquoSaintfield must be at the top of NI Waterrsquos priority list and the money needed to upgrade the sewerage system must be available. Given that the study will only be completed next December, by the time it takes to draw up detailed designs and secure money to carry out improvements, the development ban could be in place for at least two more years. This is unacceptable.Cllr Andrews said Saintfieldrsquos existing sewerage system could not cope and there were major questions over the long term future of the townrsquos treatment plant.ldquoThe preparatory work to identy solutions must be completed as soon as possible and the money required to signicantly upgrade the system must be made available, he said.ldquoI believe a new treatment works is required, but it will take time to deliver such a strategic capital investment scheme.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The backstop will come into force on the conclusion of the transition period while negotiations are continuing for an agreement that supersedes it and “unless and until” that “subsequent agreement” is applicable.“. While the UK as a whole will form a single customs territory the arrangements as a whole apply dferently in GB and Northern Ireland.“. Northern Ireland remains in the EU’s customs union and will apply the whole of the EU’s customs acquis and the Commission and the European Court of Justice will continue to have jurisdiction over its compliance with those rules.Therefore, goods passing from GB to NI will be subject to a declaration process.“. Northern Ireland will remain in the Single Market for Goods and the EU’s customs regime and will be required to apply and comply with the relevant rules and standards.Herein opens up regulatory ergence in the future.“. The implication, as outlined by the Attorney General, of NI remaining in the EU Single Market for Goods while GB does not is that for regulatory purposes GB is “essentially treated as a third country by NI for goods passing from GB into NI”.This is totally unacceptable and economically mad in that it will be erecting internal economic and trade barriers within the United Kingdom.“. The backstop will continue indefinitely and cannot be exited by the UK.Mr Cox says “Therefore despite statements in the protocol that it is not intended to be permanent and the clear intention of the parties that it should be replaced by alternative, permanent arrangements, in international law the protocol would endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement took its place in whole or in part as set out therein.” The truth is now laid bare for all to see in that the backstop will not be temporary in nature.MPs need reassurance over ending the Irish backstop says powerful Tory MP in Brexit debateHeartbreak as teenage Syrian refugee dies suddenly Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“. In paragraph  it appears possible that the EU could apply that the protocol is no longer necessary “in whole or in part” and consequently it is possible that the GB elements of the customs union could fall away leaving only Northern Ireland in the EU customs territory as the minimum necessary.“. The legal advice makes clear that the current drafting of the backstop does not provide for a mechanism that is likely to enable the UK lawfully to exit.”Mr Dodds added: “This advice concisely sets out the stark reality of the operation of the backstop.Its publication demonstrates how the Prime Minister has failed to abide by the commitments she gave in that the United Kingdom as a whole would leave the European Union and that she would ensure there would be no customs or regulatory ergence within the United Kingdom.“This backstop is totally unacceptable to Unionists throughout the United Kingdom and it must be defeated and arrangements renegotiated that uphold the commitments which the Prime Minister and her government has in the House of Commons.”try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre.

The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade.

Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”. Joining Ms Graham at the Banquet was guest speaker Jed Mercurio, creator of BBC hit dramas Bodyguard and Line of Duty.

It really is a fascinating mix of the old and the new.“With high ceilings, exposed brick feature walls, high quality wood flooring and the strikingly restored staircase from the entrance lobby, the space reflects innovative contemporary design.”The development is guiding a rental income of £, for each floor.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nick_web_1.jpg","title":"dale farm boss a no deal would be mad and disruptive for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Dale Farm chief executive Nick Whelan speaks to John Mulgrew about bringing pride to the business, growing profits, facing Brexit hurdles and expanding the dairy giant’s portfolio Nick Whelan took over at the helm of Northern Ireland’s largest dairy co-operative just as the UK decided it wanted to leave the world’s largest trading bloc.Now, marking two years in the role, after replacing long-time boss David Dobbin, he says he wanted to grow earnings and profit to more than £m, while ersying into product lines with bigger margins for the some , farmers which own the operation.At the time of writing, we still haven’t agreed what arrangement will be in place to safeguard the current trading freedoms Northern Ireland producers have. A deal is on the table, though.Nick says that, aside from issues around getting staff, a transition must be in place after March  for export certicates, otherwise he can’t sell product outside the UK.“I have an ambition to get it to the mid-s . We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table. Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before. This opportunity needs to be taken.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
