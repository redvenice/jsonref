This year’s Wimbledon Championships could have one of the hottest days everChief Meteorologist, Will Lang, said: ‘The heatwave conditions will continue to affect pretty much all parts of the UK over the next few days.‘Although peak temperatures may not be quite as high as we have seen this week, we will still see temperatures widely in the mid to high 20’s  with 30C or more still possible across southern and some central parts of England.’However, that is still a few degrees short of the hottest temperature recorded in the UK.That honour goes to Faversham in Kent in 2003. On August 10, the hottest ever temperature in the UK was recorded there, hitting a mighty 38.5C.The summer of 2003 was an incredibly hot one, with Scotland’s Greycook recording 32.9C one day earlier. It was the hottest temperature ever recorded in Scotland until June 28, 2018.That summer wasn’t the hottest overall, however. That title goes to the summer of 1976, where for 15 days towards the end of June, temperatures in all four nations topped 32C and Cheltenham recorded 35.9C at the start of July.In Dorset and Devon, no measurable rain fell for a staggering 45 days, which led to the passing of the Drought Act and water rationing.It is thought that temperatures will climb over the next two weeks, hitting 33C in the first week of July before potentially topping 35C next week.Dr Thomas Waite of PHE of Public Health England said: ‘It’s vitally important that we keep an eye on friends, family and neighbours who may be at risk.‘For others, the best thing to do is avoid the sun during the hottest parts of the day, carry water with you when travelling and if going out to large events, and we know lots of people will be watching football this week: think what you can do stay cool.’See here for more information on how hot the weather has to be for school and work to get cancelled. EuroMillions results: National lottery winning numbers for Tuesday, 3rd July 2018 drawWhen Kate Middleton will next wear a tiara revealedIndependence Day: How to keep your dog calm during July 4th fireworksBachelorette\u0027s Chris Randone shares photo of himself at age 13 when he was 230lbs... after another contestant said he used to be a \u0027fat f***\u0027Who is Kyle Edmund?

Pictured: The town during the 1950s           In Agatha Christie\u0027s day it was the Ladies Bathing Cove and as a girl the author loved to swim there. Now, critics it is strewn with rubbish and falling into disrepairBut fresh pictures show now nothing like it was back in its idyllic heyday when it was a popular and crowded bathing spot.Critics blame council cutbacks and say there are no bins which has led to streams of litter and broken bottles on the beach.The entrance path is also overgrown with nettles, brambles and grass so long it has turned to hay in the \u0027depressed and uncared-for\u0027 cove.Torbay Council admits there are no longer any rubbish bins on the beach and budget cuts mean there are no plans to clean it up.But Graham Stephenson, who lives nearby, says it is \u0027shameful\u0027 at what it has become.He has said that urgent action was needed to sort out what he described as \u0027Torquay\u0027s slum\u0027.  In Agatha Christie\u0027s day, Beacon Cove was the Ladies Bathing Cove and as a girl the author loved to swim there. She is pictured left in 1967 and right in 1949          The Torbay Council website describes Beacon Cove as a perfect haven away from the main beach of TorquayTorbay Council said that increasing budget cuts has made it harder for them to maintain a good standard for all their amenity areas.Mr Stephenson said: \u0027On my regular walk down Beacon Hill with my little dog, there were two immaculately clean tourist coaches awaiting their passengers who had been staying at a hotel at the bottom of the hill.\u0027Nearby, on Beacon Hill, there are viewing points and seating areas for visitors to enjoy the wonderful views around the Bay.Rebus author Ian Rankin gets a partner in crime-writing as...John Grisham is unveiled as a headline star at crime-writing...Making sense of Marilyn Monroe: Her first swimsuit shoot,...High school drops production of \u0027And Then There Were None\u0027...Share this article\u0027It is such a shame however that Torquay presents itself as a \u0027depressed and uncared-for\u0027 environment. The footpaths are alive with weeds and dead palm fronds.\u0027The hedge beside the footpath is being strangled by weeds. The grass, which was long, was eventually cut, but not collected and so it has turned to hay which blows around in the wind. The weeds on this area are flourishing.\u0027The viewing area at the top of the hill has seating and several specially constructed palm islands which are now overgrown with weeds and the granite chips have spread on to the footpath. The black sacking round the palms is exposed and untidy.          Critics blame council cutbacks and say there are no bins which has led to streams of litter and broken bottles on the beach\u0027I walked down the footpath to Beacon Cove and was stung by nettles and scratched by overgrown brambles. I survived the journey to be met by the sight of litter and broken bottles on the beach.\u0027There is no bin which encourages visitors to leave their litter around. This cove has a sign saying no loud music, but most weekends are spoiled by noisy gatherings on the beach, with amplified sound, fires and tents. Not to mention the litter left behind.\u0027This area and the coastal path get a lot of visitors as well as locals. The rubbish collection points are inadequate for picnickers and parties and consequently the rubbish is just dumped and attacked by the seagulls.\u0027If the area is cared for better with adequate rubbish bins and signs showing penalties for leaving litter one could hope that it might improve.\u0027Come on, Torbay Council, get out and about on foot and see for yourselves what tourists see, and endeavour to do something about the shameful environment we find ourselves living in.\u0027Torbay Council said: \u0027Torbay Council strives to try maintain a good standard for all amenity areas, however with continued budget cuts this is becoming increasingly harder.\u0027Regarding Beacon Hill, we have asked our contractor to look at tidying up the planted areas and litter pick the stated area. There is no litter bin on the beach as unfortunately this was set fire to several times, hence the blue bin is now situated at the top of the path. We will make a request to TOR2 in order to have the bin emptied more regularly.\u0027The Torbay Council website describes Beacon Cove as a perfect haven away from the main beach of Torquay.It added: \u0027At the turn of the century this beach was known as the Ladies Bathing Cove.\u0027Beacon Cove is a short walking distance from Torquay harbour side and forms part of the Agatha Christie Mile, as it was a favourite bathing spot for the writer.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/16/4DDF2CC700000578-5913955-image-m-18_1530630055721.jpg","title":"Brazen sunbather ruins couples wedding photos refusing move","story":"    The woman positioned herself  just yards from where the newlyweds had their photos takenMs Ling, from Torquay, said nobody in the wedding party had any idea who the sunbather was.Mr and Mrs Ling\u0027s families all congregated after the service on Saturday in front of an ornamental stone gazebo which stands in Tessier Gardens, a public park popular with wedding parties next to Furrough Cross Church.The backdrop is a favourite among wedding photographers seeking to capture family group shots at the end of a service.Several guests asked the bikini-clad woman to leave so that she wouldn\u0027t intrude on pictures of the couple\u0027s big day.

The UK has limited supplies of tap water, and households that pour hundreds of gallons onto their garden are exacerbating a growing shortage and bringing a hosepipe ban ever nearer.Secondly, it’s a waste of effort better used elsewhere. Grass is a hardy plant which, in our climate, is almost impossible to kill. A lawn that looks parched today will quickly recover during a spell of wet weather.‘Never, ever water your lawn — it’s a complete waste of time, energy, money and everything,’ is the stern verdict of Stefan Buczacki, former Gardeners’ Question Time panellist. ‘As I look out of my study, the lawn has gone from green to cornfield brown. But I know it will return, and in the meantime I don’t need to bother mowing every week.’Getting your priorities rightIn nature, the weakest are always the most vulnerable. That means juvenile and new plants, which have yet to properly establish themselves, need the most looking after.In current conditions, anything you’ve planted in the past couple of years ought to be given extra help.Beyond that your priority should be the vegetables which are most vulnerable to drought.‘Courgettes, lettuces, tomatoes, cucumbers — the soft succulent vegetables where the bulk of the crop is made up of water — are obviously the ones that need it the most,’ says Buczacki.Vegetables such as cauliflowers ought to be left until the edible parts of the plant appear, and then watered liberally. The same goes for peas, beans and sweetcorn. Water them before their flowers appear and you’ll have huge plants with plenty of leaves, but not a lot of what you want to eat.Starve it of water and it’ll worry it’s about to die, so set about the business of reproducing — giving you a bigger crop in the process.Want to sunbathe naked during the heatwave? Make sure to...Britain screams for WATER! UK battles double crisis as taps...Share this articleThe best time to water is... 4 amTurning on the hose when the sun’s beating down is pointless: on a warm windy day, 18 per cent of water can evaporate before it even hits the ground. In extreme conditions, water drops can even act as a sort of magnifying glass, scorching healthy leaves.Logic dictates that gardeners should do the job at dusk, giving water plenty of time to work its way into the soil.But there’s a catch. ‘Typically, people get in from work, have a cup of tea and then turn on the hosepipe,’ says Guy Barter, chief horticulturalist at the Royal Horticultural Society.‘This means there’s a huge surge in demand at about 7pm, so the pressure in the system goes right down, and the job takes longer than it should. A better bet, if you can, is to do your watering when everyone else is in bed.’Barter says 4am is actually the best time for the job: there is very little drying wind at that hour, and lots of pressure in the system.You don’t have to be an insomniac to take advantage of these conditions, either: most garden centres sell timers that can be fitted to taps allowing them to do the job while you are asleep.Technique is everythingWatering little and often might sound like a good idea, but it’s a big mistake. By constantly adding moisture to the upper layer of the soil, you are encouraging plants to develop a shallow root system.For a plant to thrive, its roots need to grow as deep as possible.The correct technique, therefore, is to give each plant a thorough soaking every week or two. ‘Rather than giving the whole garden a light spray, you should concentrate your efforts on a few different plants each night,’ advises Barter.‘And to properly refresh the soil, you need much more water than you think — around four two-gallon watering cans full, for each square metre of ground.’And to ensure sufficient liquid actually ends up reaching your plants’ deep roots, he advises building a small bank of soil around the base of each plant before watering, thereby creating a small pool.    Follow our expert tips for the greenest grass and the prettiest plantsWhich beds need most water?This question ides the crowd. Buczacki takes a pragmatic approach, advising gardeners to water only the flowerbeds they see the most of.‘It’s for aesthetic value,’ he says. ‘So if you have a bed that’s 100 yards from the house, you have to ask yourself whether it’s worth the effort. But if it’s right next to you, and you get pleasure from it, then of course things are different.’Sometimes, as with vegetables, starving plants of water can actually make them flower better, adds Barter of the RHS. He recommends that plants in herbaceous borders get a good soaking every fortnight.‘Things like delphiniums and lupins are surprisingly resilient, even in real heatwaves.‘Then, after they have flowered, you can cut them back to ground level and, hopefully, they will re-flower in September.’Other experts are opposed to watering on principle. The late horticulturalist Beth Chatto, who died in May and laid out drought-resistant gardens for the Prince of Wales, took the view that all gardens ought to be able to survive local conditions, so designed flowerbeds to need no watering once they were established.Can you stop soil drying out?A layer of mulch, particularly made from tree bark, can prevent water evaporating from the soil. But beware, there’s no point laying it down now (unless you’ve first soaked the ground thoroughly for hours) since that will simply lock existing dryness in.If you do fancy mulching, add a small amount to the area immediately around each plant, straight after you have just given it a serious drenching.Best flowers for a heatwaveLook for plants that come from hot countries. Geraniums, for instance, are from South Africa, hate their roots getting too wet and are comparatively drought resistant. Ditto African marigolds.Herbs such as rosemary and thyme do especially well in the heat. So, too, does lavender.Plants in pots - a special caseAn exception to the ban on ‘little and often’ watering are plants in pots, which have comparatively small amounts of soil to survive on, so should be watered every day.If that job gets to be too much, the RHS advises transferring plants to bigger pots, which can retain more moisture, or moving them all into a shaded area.Pot plants standing in a single group are easier to water. And their close proximity to each other can create a micro-climate, helping them to retain moisture while other areas wilt in the heat. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/04/4DE7D84200000578-0-image-a-4_1530675404544.jpg","title":"How terrified Thai boys there","story":"    How will they get them out?

First, it is understood that none of the boys can swim and at least 1.5 miles of the route is understood to be flooded. It took four hours for the most experienced ers to reach the location.Furthermore, the path involves a narrow 400-yard section now completely underwater and so clogged with mud that visibility is down to nothing. One rescuer described it as \u0027swimming through cold coffee\u0027.In places, there is insufficient space for both a human and an air tank, meaning that ers have to remove the oxygen tanks from their backs and push them in front.The challenges of chaperoning weak and frightened children through such an ordeal are self-evident.Yet, the predicted run of bad weather may force the Thai government\u0027s hand.Throughout yesterday, further tales of heroism continued to emerge following Monday night\u0027s dramatic discovery by the British cave ers.Two Thai medics yesterday nobly volunteered to join the youngsters and remain with them for as long as it takes. Some reports suggest that it could be a four-month wait for the water levels to drop.           British ers Rick Stanton (right) and John Volanthen (left) were the first to reach twelve trapped schoolboys in the waters of the cave system in Tham Luang, Thailand           Foreign ers head to Tham Luang Nang Non cave to continue the rescue operation after the 12 boys and their coach were found alive in the cave          A first meal of rice and pork - packaged up in sealed portions - is being prepared for the youngsters, who have already been given energy gels and paracetamol. Pictured, a huge international team of rescuers has assembled at the mouth of the caveWhile they were all inside, however, a flash flood sealed off the exit forcing the boys to head further into the mountain. Armed with a single functioning torch, they managed to reach the spot where they have subsequently been discovered.We can only begin to imagine the mounting sense of fear and panic as the parents of the \u0027Wild Boars\u0027 football team went in search of their missing sons back on that evening of June 23.To put it in perspective – and we are talking about football-mad teenagers here – it was the night before England thrashed Panama in the World Cup. That is how long this lot have been missing. A local search party finally stumbled across some of the boys\u0027 bicycles locked to a fence and a pile of football boots. The mystery of where they had gone was solved. Now an even greater mystery lay ahead.The following day, the police found footprints and handprints inside the caves but heavy rain had made much of the cave system impassable. Families could only wait and try not to fear the worst, building makeshift shrines, making votive offerings and praying.

At some point soon thereafter, however, Messrs Stanton and Volanthen made their sensational discovery.News bulletins around the world were interrupted to announce their success. Here was a glorious good news story right up there with the great escapes of modern times – like the 33 Chilean miners trapped 2,300 feet below ground for 69 days in 2010. Except, of course, they had yet to escape.Initially, Rear Admiral Arpakorn Yookongkaew of the Thai navy said that there was no rush to move the boys as they were safe where they were. Others have since warned that the rain is the key factor.A \u0027comfort plan\u0027 has been put in place to aid the boys.Diving lines have been laid out so that other rescue team members can maintain deliveries of food, clothing and medical supplies with antibiotics and paracetamol already prescribed as a precaution. Any plan to walk and swim the boys out could take up to six hours per child and energy levels will be crucial.Perhaps even more impressive than their physical condition is their mental state. \u0027Really when you think about it: nine days, complete darkness, no food – that mental will to live,\u0027 said Captain Jessica Tait, a member of the US Air Force rescue contingent. \u0027And these boys have it.\u0027 Their families seem to have it, too. All remained in good spirits yesterday. \u0027I want to give him a hug. I miss him very much,\u0027 said Tham Chanthawong, the aunt of the boys\u0027 coach.\u0027In these ten days, how many million seconds have there been? I\u0027ve missed him every second.\u0027This remote rural hillside near the border with Laos and Myanmar is currently a teeming metropolis of rescue workers, engineers, troops, politicians, relatives, media and local well-wishers producing round-the-clock vats of noodles for all concerned.It has all the makings of a Hollywood epic – and, no doubt, the producers are on their way. Yet that happy ending is still some way off. Our thoughts may be focused on that fetid dungeon deep inside the mountain.For now, though, it is the sky above which will determine what happens next. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/00/4DE5453400000578-0-image-m-50_1530662350587.jpg","title":"British fishermen fairer share sea","story":"    British fishermen are set to get a \u0027fairer share\u0027 of the UK\u0027s historic fishing grounds after Brexit, Michael Gove will say today.

Some cities have canceled fireworks displays because of extreme fire danger.In New Mexico, all or part of three national forests remain closed because of the threat of wildfire, putting a damper on holiday camping plans. The forests that are open have strict rules, especially when it comes to fireworks.\u0027We\u0027re just urging people to use extreme caution,\u0027 said Wendy Mason, a spokeswoman for the New Mexico State Forestry Division.\u0027We want people to have fun and enjoy themselves, but we prefer they leave the fireworks shows to the professionals.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/07/4DE832B900000578-0-image-a-37_1530684947424.jpg","title":"Homeowner finds gold Brisbane property","story":"    A homeowner was shocked when he found a gold mine (pictured) in his backyard after buying a new house          Anthony Doolin purchased the Brisbane property (pictured) three years ago but was not aware of the gold mine at the time Upon closer inspection of the mine, it was discovered that it was six metres deep with the ironbark still intact.After doing a bit of research of the area, Mr Doolin found that there were a few other mines in the hills.Revealed: The prices real estate around Australia will reach...Share this article\u0027There was a lot of mining at the turn of the century and in those hills there are quite a few little mines,\u0027 Mr Doolin told the publication.  During his time there, Mr Doolin never ventured into the gold mine to find if there was gold in there, and had his mother sell the property.   The property was sold for $1.35 million last week, the same price Mr Doolin paid when he bought it.           The property was sold for $1.35 million last week, the same price Mr Doolin paid when he bought it Brisbane man¿s shock discovery of a gold mine in his backyard - realestate.com.au"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/07/4DE56C7800000578-0-Rebekah_Vardy_was_full_of_praise_as_her_husband_Jamie_met_her_in-m-3_1530685965821.jpg","title":"WAGs pride Englands wives girlfriends congratulate partners","story":"    Sealed with a kiss: Dele Alli of England kisses his girlfriend Ruby Mae following England\u0027s dramatic World Cup penalty shoot-out victory over Colombia last night  Sealed with a kiss: Rebekah Vardy was full of praise as her footballer husband Jamie met her in the stands following his team\u0027s sensational victory          England striker Marcus Rashford who scored a penalty in the dramatic shoot out embraces his girlfriend Lucia Loi in the stands after last night\u0027s dramatic victory          England defender Kieran Trippier rushed to the embrace of his wife Charlotte before picking up his son Jacob after the final whistle          Captain fantastic: England\u0027s talisman and the World Cup\u0027s leading goalscorer Harry Kane soaks up the adulation from his family after the final whistle.

Six years later he had made a huge impression on his team - and on bosses at Everton.The star keeper was officially contracted to the team in 2017 for a five-year stint, and has a confirmed salary of £25million, likely to increase to £30million with add-ons.Pickford\u0027s pre-match rituals are not well known but he once admitted he used to always eat chicken and pasta from a plastic tub in the back of the car on the way to games.           Megan Davison and Jordan Pickford have been dating for around eight years after meeting as teenagers at school           It was a tense moment for Megan as the game went to penalties and the spotlight was on her footballer boyfriend          Megan Davison, 22, was cheering her boyfriend on after travelling to Russia with him from their home in Liverpool.

I said, Well, the handsome one is obviously me, and I\u0027m guessing that scrawny little kid is you?.\u0027Former team mate George Honeyman also praised Pickford who he says has always been confident. \u0027I played with him all the way through and he\u0027s always been such a fierce competitor,\u0027 he said.\u0027He had his mood swings if he didn\u0027t get his own way, but the main reason he has succeeded is how competitive and aggressive he is.\u0027Off the pitch, he\u0027s the life and soul, no-one dislikes him. Everyone says goalkeepers are mad, but he genuinely is, he\u0027s a nutter, in the nicest way.

Once, team mates overheard him telling Jordan he wouldn\u0027t make it with his attitude - to which the goalie replied \u0027I bet I will\u0027. Ball said: \u0027He thought he was the best. He knew he had potential and athletic ability. But you have to work hard to achieve that, and he has.\u0027He wanted to be in the first-team at 17 and was pushy, but I liked that. He challenged me.\u0027And, on the morning of his senior debut at Sunderland Pickford called his former coach, just to say thank you. Pickford is expected to start in England\u0027s game against Sweden on Saturday."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/09/4DE87EC800000578-5916757-image-m-9_1530693072928.jpg","title":"Shocking moment sun bather swings dog lead","story":"    Agricultural worker Charlene, from Bournemouth, Dorset, claims the owner had already done this a few times and hit the dog before she started filmingFootage shows the owner swinging the dog by its lead across the sand before appearing to try to hit it as punishment for not obeying her. Agricultural worker Charlene, from Bournemouth, Dorset, claims the owner had already done this a few times and hit the dog before she started filming. The footage racked up almost 2million views after she shared it on social media, where it was received more than 50,000 shares and comments. Charlene said: \u0027The dog appeared distressed by the heat to me. He was panting, his tongue was stuck right out. \u0027He was still a little happy soul really, which is what is so disheartening. \u0027I have dogs and he was evidently getting too hot. Other than him keeling over, he can\u0027t remove himself from that situation.   Charlene Keightley, 30, was enjoying a day out at the beach in Branksome Chine, Bournemouth, on Friday when she overheard a woman shouting at her pet\u0027And that\u0027s what people don\u0027t realise - dog can\u0027t communicate with us or remove themselves from the situation. \u0027This woman was completely and utterly oblivious as to why the dog was trying to hide behind her, which was to get out of the sun.\u0027 The incident occurred between 1pm and 2pm in one of the hottest periods of the day during Britain\u0027s heatwave. Charlene said: \u0027I see it all the time down at the beach. Police raid home and free four dogs after girl is seen on...\u0027We offer a free car ventilation service - all you have to...Share this article    Footage shows the owner swinging the dog by its lead across the sand before appearing to try to hit it as punishment for not obeying her.\u0027The dog was on the lead and so it couldn\u0027t even get to the water to cool down. \u0027She only took it down to the water once during the whole time she was there. Even an hour later when she went to rinse off something in the sea, she didn\u0027t take the dog with her. \u0027When we have long hot summers like we are now, as a nation we need to be a lot more aware of it. \u0027Me and my friend started to notice her shouting at it. That made us sit up and we said if she shout at it or slaps at it again we will say something. \u0027I decided to video her as it\u0027s not acceptable. Even if she says it\u0027s her dog, well she shouldn\u0027t do that in public as it\u0027s not nice for everyone else to have to look at it. \u0027When she walked past us we called her over and said excuse me, we\u0027ve watched you try to hit that dog four or five times and you\u0027re shouting at it and it is way too hot out here for it. \u0027We said that was why the dog was acting how it was but she was foreign and just said OK, OK, OK and then that was it.\u0027 The video went quickly viral and attracted thousands of comments from angry animal lovers who slammed the dog owner as a \u0027nasty, senseless b****\u0027.           Agricultural worker Charlene, from Bournemouth, Dorset, claims the owner had already done this a few times and hit the dog before she started filming. Pictured: Branksome Chine in Bournemouth Many called for her dog to be taken off her. Meanwhile, despite her efforts to confront the woman, others gave Charlene abuse for not doing more to protect the dog. Charlene said: \u0027I didn\u0027t expect for the video to blow up like it has. People have been saying I should have taken the dog off her. But it\u0027s a beach full of people and other people were shouting at her to stop it. \u0027OK, the dog was in harm\u0027s way but it wasn\u0027t the right situation to go over there and steal her dog - because that\u0027s what it would have been. We would have stolen it. \u0027We shared it to raise awareness. I reported her to the beach lifeguards and who had the brollies. One of the girls said she reported it to the RSPCA but I don\u0027t know much about that. \u0027Sadly I didn\u0027t get a close enough photograph of her and don\u0027t have a name for her though so I\u0027m not sure what can come of it. \u0027I\u0027ve always said that the RSPCA or councils should be down there talking to people about it because they don\u0027t know these things. \u0027I\u0027m not saying there should be a fine or anything, but there should be banners warning people to be aware of the temperature and of the heat of the pavement. \u0027As far as I know it has been reported to the RSPCA and they\u0027ve said they will be in touch if they need any more information. \u0027I can\u0027t really do any more than that - I\u0027m a normal person with a full time job. I can\u0027t go on some escapade to save beach dogs. \u0027So unless the police got in touch and asked for the video there\u0027s nothing more I feel appropriate that I can do - other than spread the word to educate the public such as through social media.\u0027 Numerous beaches across the UK, including some in Bournemouth, have banned dog owners from walking their pooches on the beach during May and September. An RSPCA spokesperson said: \u0027With the prolonged hot weather we\u0027ve been experiencing recently we would urge owners to be extremely cautious with their pets when out and about in the sunshine. \u0027We\u0027d encourage people only to take their pets out during cooler parts of the day, to ensure they always have free access to shade and fresh water, and to contact the vet if they display any worrying symptoms of heatstroke such as excessive panting and drooling, a lack of coordination, vomiting or collapse. \u0027Anyone with information about this video can get in touch with the RSPCA by calling our 24-hour line on 0300 1234 999.\u0027 Bournemouth Council were contacted for comment. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/09/4DE8945D00000578-0-image-a-11_1530692159638.jpg","title":"Colombian newspapers praise team fume referee","story":"Colombian newspapers have praised their national team for \u0027dying with their boots on\u0027 after they were knocked out of the World Cup by England          El Pais, one of the country\u0027s largest newspapers, ran with the headline \u0027Thanks Warriors!\u0027 and praised the team for never giving up          El Tiempo, the country\u0027s largest newspaper, ran the headline: \u0027Goodbye to the Russian World Cup with honour but without glory\u0027Speaking to pan-Latin American television station Telesur, he said: \u0027This referee knows a lot about baseball, but he has no idea about football.\u0027The World Cup winner was particularly incensed about the second-half penalty awarded to Harry Kane, saying it was the English striker\u0027s own fault.Our heroes!

Pictured: The town during the 1950s           In Agatha Christie\u0027s day it was the Ladies Bathing Cove and as a girl the author loved to swim there. Now, critics it is strewn with rubbish and falling into disrepairBut fresh pictures show now nothing like it was back in its idyllic heyday when it was a popular and crowded bathing spot.Critics blame council cutbacks and say there are no bins which has led to streams of litter and broken bottles on the beach.The entrance path is also overgrown with nettles, brambles and grass so long it has turned to hay in the \u0027depressed and uncared-for\u0027 cove.Torbay Council admits there are no longer any rubbish bins on the beach and budget cuts mean there are no plans to clean it up.But Graham Stephenson, who lives nearby, says it is \u0027shameful\u0027 at what it has become.He has said that urgent action was needed to sort out what he described as \u0027Torquay\u0027s slum\u0027.  In Agatha Christie\u0027s day, Beacon Cove was the Ladies Bathing Cove and as a girl the author loved to swim there. She is pictured left in 1967 and right in 1949          The Torbay Council website describes Beacon Cove as a perfect haven away from the main beach of TorquayTorbay Council said that increasing budget cuts has made it harder for them to maintain a good standard for all their amenity areas.Mr Stephenson said: \u0027On my regular walk down Beacon Hill with my little dog, there were two immaculately clean tourist coaches awaiting their passengers who had been staying at a hotel at the bottom of the hill.\u0027Nearby, on Beacon Hill, there are viewing points and seating areas for visitors to enjoy the wonderful views around the Bay.Rebus author Ian Rankin gets a partner in crime-writing as...John Grisham is unveiled as a headline star at crime-writing...Making sense of Marilyn Monroe: Her first swimsuit shoot,...High school drops production of \u0027And Then There Were None\u0027...Share this article\u0027It is such a shame however that Torquay presents itself as a \u0027depressed and uncared-for\u0027 environment. The footpaths are alive with weeds and dead palm fronds.\u0027The hedge beside the footpath is being strangled by weeds. The grass, which was long, was eventually cut, but not collected and so it has turned to hay which blows around in the wind. The weeds on this area are flourishing.\u0027The viewing area at the top of the hill has seating and several specially constructed palm islands which are now overgrown with weeds and the granite chips have spread on to the footpath. The black sacking round the palms is exposed and untidy.          Critics blame council cutbacks and say there are no bins which has led to streams of litter and broken bottles on the beach\u0027I walked down the footpath to Beacon Cove and was stung by nettles and scratched by overgrown brambles. I survived the journey to be met by the sight of litter and broken bottles on the beach.\u0027There is no bin which encourages visitors to leave their litter around. This cove has a sign saying no loud music, but most weekends are spoiled by noisy gatherings on the beach, with amplified sound, fires and tents. Not to mention the litter left behind.\u0027This area and the coastal path get a lot of visitors as well as locals. The rubbish collection points are inadequate for picnickers and parties and consequently the rubbish is just dumped and attacked by the seagulls.\u0027If the area is cared for better with adequate rubbish bins and signs showing penalties for leaving litter one could hope that it might improve.\u0027Come on, Torbay Council, get out and about on foot and see for yourselves what tourists see, and endeavour to do something about the shameful environment we find ourselves living in.\u0027Torbay Council said: \u0027Torbay Council strives to try maintain a good standard for all amenity areas, however with continued budget cuts this is becoming increasingly harder.\u0027Regarding Beacon Hill, we have asked our contractor to look at tidying up the planted areas and litter pick the stated area. There is no litter bin on the beach as unfortunately this was set fire to several times, hence the blue bin is now situated at the top of the path. We will make a request to TOR2 in order to have the bin emptied more regularly.\u0027The Torbay Council website describes Beacon Cove as a perfect haven away from the main beach of Torquay.It added: \u0027At the turn of the century this beach was known as the Ladies Bathing Cove.\u0027Beacon Cove is a short walking distance from Torquay harbour side and forms part of the Agatha Christie Mile, as it was a favourite bathing spot for the writer.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/20/4DE4625800000578-5914757-image-a-3_1530647323313.jpg","title":"Three Lions fans leave streets head home early catch crunch Colombia game","story":"    The roads are empty and the pubs are full on the A10 by Liverpool Street Station in the City, an otherwise busy spot for traffic          Clear streets as football fans head away from the usually bustling streets to enjoy the game against ColombiaThe usually crowded Westminster was also empty, as the Houses of Parliament and Elizabeth Tower were captured with no tourists outside.In the City, London\u0027s Liverpool street was deserted at 7pm. Even the M25, known for its congestion, was pictured with barely any cars on it during what is usually rush hour.

The UK has limited supplies of tap water, and households that pour hundreds of gallons onto their garden are exacerbating a growing shortage and bringing a hosepipe ban ever nearer.Secondly, it’s a waste of effort better used elsewhere. Grass is a hardy plant which, in our climate, is almost impossible to kill. A lawn that looks parched today will quickly recover during a spell of wet weather.‘Never, ever water your lawn — it’s a complete waste of time, energy, money and everything,’ is the stern verdict of Stefan Buczacki, former Gardeners’ Question Time panellist. ‘As I look out of my study, the lawn has gone from green to cornfield brown. But I know it will return, and in the meantime I don’t need to bother mowing every week.’Getting your priorities rightIn nature, the weakest are always the most vulnerable. That means juvenile and new plants, which have yet to properly establish themselves, need the most looking after.In current conditions, anything you’ve planted in the past couple of years ought to be given extra help.Beyond that your priority should be the vegetables which are most vulnerable to drought.‘Courgettes, lettuces, tomatoes, cucumbers — the soft succulent vegetables where the bulk of the crop is made up of water — are obviously the ones that need it the most,’ says Buczacki.Vegetables such as cauliflowers ought to be left until the edible parts of the plant appear, and then watered liberally. The same goes for peas, beans and sweetcorn. Water them before their flowers appear and you’ll have huge plants with plenty of leaves, but not a lot of what you want to eat.Starve it of water and it’ll worry it’s about to die, so set about the business of reproducing — giving you a bigger crop in the process.Want to sunbathe naked during the heatwave? Make sure to...Britain screams for WATER! UK battles double crisis as taps...Share this articleThe best time to water is... 4 amTurning on the hose when the sun’s beating down is pointless: on a warm windy day, 18 per cent of water can evaporate before it even hits the ground. In extreme conditions, water drops can even act as a sort of magnifying glass, scorching healthy leaves.Logic dictates that gardeners should do the job at dusk, giving water plenty of time to work its way into the soil.But there’s a catch. ‘Typically, people get in from work, have a cup of tea and then turn on the hosepipe,’ says Guy Barter, chief horticulturalist at the Royal Horticultural Society.‘This means there’s a huge surge in demand at about 7pm, so the pressure in the system goes right down, and the job takes longer than it should. A better bet, if you can, is to do your watering when everyone else is in bed.’Barter says 4am is actually the best time for the job: there is very little drying wind at that hour, and lots of pressure in the system.You don’t have to be an insomniac to take advantage of these conditions, either: most garden centres sell timers that can be fitted to taps allowing them to do the job while you are asleep.Technique is everythingWatering little and often might sound like a good idea, but it’s a big mistake. By constantly adding moisture to the upper layer of the soil, you are encouraging plants to develop a shallow root system.For a plant to thrive, its roots need to grow as deep as possible.The correct technique, therefore, is to give each plant a thorough soaking every week or two. ‘Rather than giving the whole garden a light spray, you should concentrate your efforts on a few different plants each night,’ advises Barter.‘And to properly refresh the soil, you need much more water than you think — around four two-gallon watering cans full, for each square metre of ground.’And to ensure sufficient liquid actually ends up reaching your plants’ deep roots, he advises building a small bank of soil around the base of each plant before watering, thereby creating a small pool.    Follow our expert tips for the greenest grass and the prettiest plantsWhich beds need most water?This question ides the crowd. Buczacki takes a pragmatic approach, advising gardeners to water only the flowerbeds they see the most of.‘It’s for aesthetic value,’ he says. ‘So if you have a bed that’s 100 yards from the house, you have to ask yourself whether it’s worth the effort. But if it’s right next to you, and you get pleasure from it, then of course things are different.’Sometimes, as with vegetables, starving plants of water can actually make them flower better, adds Barter of the RHS. He recommends that plants in herbaceous borders get a good soaking every fortnight.‘Things like delphiniums and lupins are surprisingly resilient, even in real heatwaves.‘Then, after they have flowered, you can cut them back to ground level and, hopefully, they will re-flower in September.’Other experts are opposed to watering on principle. The late horticulturalist Beth Chatto, who died in May and laid out drought-resistant gardens for the Prince of Wales, took the view that all gardens ought to be able to survive local conditions, so designed flowerbeds to need no watering once they were established.Can you stop soil drying out?A layer of mulch, particularly made from tree bark, can prevent water evaporating from the soil. But beware, there’s no point laying it down now (unless you’ve first soaked the ground thoroughly for hours) since that will simply lock existing dryness in.If you do fancy mulching, add a small amount to the area immediately around each plant, straight after you have just given it a serious drenching.Best flowers for a heatwaveLook for plants that come from hot countries. Geraniums, for instance, are from South Africa, hate their roots getting too wet and are comparatively drought resistant. Ditto African marigolds.Herbs such as rosemary and thyme do especially well in the heat. So, too, does lavender.Plants in pots - a special caseAn exception to the ban on ‘little and often’ watering are plants in pots, which have comparatively small amounts of soil to survive on, so should be watered every day.If that job gets to be too much, the RHS advises transferring plants to bigger pots, which can retain more moisture, or moving them all into a shaded area.Pot plants standing in a single group are easier to water. And their close proximity to each other can create a micro-climate, helping them to retain moisture while other areas wilt in the heat. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/04/4DE7D84200000578-0-image-a-4_1530675404544.jpg","title":"How terrified Thai boys there","story":"    How will they get them out?

It will mean they will have to learn how to using e equipment so they can be guided out through the water with the aid of professionals.\u0027    The initial euphoria of finding 12 missing teenagers and their coach (pictured) alive after ten days lost inside the flooded Tham Luang Nang Non cave labyrinth was starting to fade yesterday           Thai soldiers are seen pumping flooded water out of the cave complex during a rescue operation for a missing youth soccer team and their coach at Tham Luang caveThis, it transpired, will be very much harder than it sounds. First, it is understood that none of the boys can swim and at least 1.5 miles of the route is understood to be flooded. It took four hours for the most experienced ers to reach the location.Furthermore, the path involves a narrow 400-yard section now completely underwater and so clogged with mud that visibility is down to nothing. One rescuer described it as \u0027swimming through cold coffee\u0027.In places, there is insufficient space for both a human and an air tank, meaning that ers have to remove the oxygen tanks from their backs and push them in front.The challenges of chaperoning weak and frightened children through such an ordeal are self-evident.Yet, the predicted run of bad weather may force the Thai government\u0027s hand.Throughout yesterday, further tales of heroism continued to emerge following Monday night\u0027s dramatic discovery by the British cave ers.Two Thai medics yesterday nobly volunteered to join the youngsters and remain with them for as long as it takes. Some reports suggest that it could be a four-month wait for the water levels to drop.           British ers Rick Stanton (right) and John Volanthen (left) were the first to reach twelve trapped schoolboys in the waters of the cave system in Tham Luang, Thailand           Foreign ers head to Tham Luang Nang Non cave to continue the rescue operation after the 12 boys and their coach were found alive in the cave          A first meal of rice and pork - packaged up in sealed portions - is being prepared for the youngsters, who have already been given energy gels and paracetamol. Pictured, a huge international team of rescuers has assembled at the mouth of the caveWhile they were all inside, however, a flash flood sealed off the exit forcing the boys to head further into the mountain. Armed with a single functioning torch, they managed to reach the spot where they have subsequently been discovered.We can only begin to imagine the mounting sense of fear and panic as the parents of the \u0027Wild Boars\u0027 football team went in search of their missing sons back on that evening of June 23.To put it in perspective – and we are talking about football-mad teenagers here – it was the night before England thrashed Panama in the World Cup. That is how long this lot have been missing. A local search party finally stumbled across some of the boys\u0027 bicycles locked to a fence and a pile of football boots. The mystery of where they had gone was solved. Now an even greater mystery lay ahead.The following day, the police found footprints and handprints inside the caves but heavy rain had made much of the cave system impassable. Families could only wait and try not to fear the worst, building makeshift shrines, making votive offerings and praying.

At some point soon thereafter, however, Messrs Stanton and Volanthen made their sensational discovery.News bulletins around the world were interrupted to announce their success. Here was a glorious good news story right up there with the great escapes of modern times – like the 33 Chilean miners trapped 2,300 feet below ground for 69 days in 2010. Except, of course, they had yet to escape.Initially, Rear Admiral Arpakorn Yookongkaew of the Thai navy said that there was no rush to move the boys as they were safe where they were. Others have since warned that the rain is the key factor.A \u0027comfort plan\u0027 has been put in place to aid the boys.Diving lines have been laid out so that other rescue team members can maintain deliveries of food, clothing and medical supplies with antibiotics and paracetamol already prescribed as a precaution. Any plan to walk and swim the boys out could take up to six hours per child and energy levels will be crucial.Perhaps even more impressive than their physical condition is their mental state. \u0027Really when you think about it: nine days, complete darkness, no food – that mental will to live,\u0027 said Captain Jessica Tait, a member of the US Air Force rescue contingent. \u0027And these boys have it.\u0027 Their families seem to have it, too. All remained in good spirits yesterday. \u0027I want to give him a hug. I miss him very much,\u0027 said Tham Chanthawong, the aunt of the boys\u0027 coach.\u0027In these ten days, how many million seconds have there been? I\u0027ve missed him every second.\u0027This remote rural hillside near the border with Laos and Myanmar is currently a teeming metropolis of rescue workers, engineers, troops, politicians, relatives, media and local well-wishers producing round-the-clock vats of noodles for all concerned.It has all the makings of a Hollywood epic – and, no doubt, the producers are on their way. Yet that happy ending is still some way off. Our thoughts may be focused on that fetid dungeon deep inside the mountain.For now, though, it is the sky above which will determine what happens next. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/07/4DE56C7800000578-0-Rebekah_Vardy_was_full_of_praise_as_her_husband_Jamie_met_her_in-m-3_1530685965821.jpg","title":"WAGs pride Englands wives girlfriends congratulate partners","story":"    Sealed with a kiss: Dele Alli of England kisses his girlfriend Ruby Mae following England\u0027s dramatic World Cup penalty shoot-out victory over Colombia last night  Sealed with a kiss: Rebekah Vardy was full of praise as her footballer husband Jamie met her in the stands following his team\u0027s sensational victory          England striker Marcus Rashford who scored a penalty in the dramatic shoot out embraces his girlfriend Lucia Loi in the stands after last night\u0027s dramatic victory          England defender Kieran Trippier rushed to the embrace of his wife Charlotte before picking up his son Jacob after the final whistle          Captain fantastic: England\u0027s talisman and the World Cup\u0027s leading goalscorer Harry Kane soaks up the adulation from his family after the final whistle.

He is standing in the middle of a room in the Kunstmuseum Basel, where he is preparing an exhibition on the theme of the Black Madonna. Amid the packing materials and exhibits waiting to be hung stands a roughly life-sized sculpture of a seated Virgin Mary. She holds an orb in one hand. On her lap sits baby Jesus, also holding an orb. Her features are eroded as if she has been cast from a weathered medieval statue. And she is very black – made of a shiny, plasticky-looking material that turns out to be tar. Gates uses tar a lot in his work his father was a roofer and bequeathed his son his tar kettle. “I feel like this is the Mary of my youth, ’cos it’s in tar,” says Gates. He leans in and sniffs her head. “Oh yeah, I know her.”He explains that this tar Mary was not based on a medieval statue but a plastic keyring, just a couple of inches high, that a friend gave him as a good luck charm. “The keychain was already old, so the limbs had been busted off. She was probably carried in someone’s purse or their pocket with their keys, and then the cares of this world tore her apart.”It is often hard to get a sense of scale with Gates’s work. At college, he studied urban planning and ceramics, and his work covers all points in between. He made his name a decade ago with an exhibition of pottery supposedly crafted by a Japanese master, “Shoji Yamaguchi”, who came to Mississippi and married a black civil rights activist. It was an elaborate fiction, complete with a mixed-race actor impersonating the potter’s son, but it got the art world’s attention. “White people love Japanese people,” he later explained. At the other end of the scale, there’s his Rebuild Foundation, which has spent the last six years buying up condemned buildings (including a neoclassical 1920s bank building) in the infamously deprived, predominantly African American South Side district of his native Chicago. With the blessing of the city’s mayor, Rahm Emanuel, Gates has refurbished these buildings and repurposed them as community facilities: workshops for artists, apartments, a library, a black cinema.In between, Gates has made art out of everyday materials, often salvaged from his buildings. He has become a collector and custodian of archives, including the image libraries of the influential African American magazines Ebony and Jet, and the record collection of Chicago house DJ Frankie Knuckles, who died in 2014. He lectures to town planners and is a professor at the University of Chicago. He also makes wild spiritual music with his band, the Black Monks of Mississippi. You never know what he’s going to do next – and you never have to wait very long to find out. “My hope is that people would start to see some through-lines between my works of art,” he says. The Rebuild projects, for example, were not only about community and regeneration. “They were more about one’s ability to understand space and power and politics, and then really be a player, an instigator, in one’s own environment. So even though I was a black man in a black neighbourhood, talking about black power, what I was trying to demonstrate is that an artist who reads the dynamics of a situation can change the situation.” One obvious through-line in Gates’s work is his consciousness of African American identity and experience. Another, which emerges in his work in Basel, is spirituality. “Over the last several years, the work has not shied away from subjects of faith, of what I call the immaterial world,” he says.Basel is an apt location. The city is a centre of the art world (or, at least, the art market) thanks to its annual Art Basel fair, and it is virtually the geographical heart of Europe. And it is not, it has to be said, a place where you see many people of colour – either on the streets or on the walls of its galleries. Kunstmuseum Basel’s permanent collection features a wealth of European representations of the Virgin Mary (who was, let’s not forget, Middle Eastern). One of these, by 16th-century Dutch painter Maerten van Heemskerck, Gates is incorporating into his own exhibition. In the painting, Mary has smooth, rosy-white skin and blond hair. She looks quizzically at the viewer, as if to ask, “Are you sure I look like the Virgin Mary?” Van Heemskerck’s Madonna will be juxtaposed with 13,000 images of 20th-century black women from Gates’s Ebony and Jet archives, including politicians, celebrities, unknown models and everyday people. “When I close my eyes and think of God, I see my mom,” he says. “I don’t see a white Jesus, I don’t see an oblique figure. Maybe there’s something really powerful about these unsung heroes that deserves attention today, or at least deserves my attention.” As well as cultural history, this is Gates reflecting on, perhaps even atoning for, his gender. “The work I make is really heavy, quite a substantial kind of male art – boy sculpture.” He flexes his muscles. But this is more a reflection on “the quiet and graceful power of women and of the mother”, he says. “Maybe, in this moment of the complexities of #MeToo, the retaking of power that women are asserting and articulating, that this male world, as we’ve known it, is over, that this Caucasian world we’ve known is over.” So the exhibition is “also a bit of a redemptive moment,” he says. There are other facets to the show. Gates connects Europe’s tradition of Black Madonna icons to Detroit’s Shrine of the Black Madonna, a black liberation theology group established by Bishop Albert Cleage in the 1960s, which put African American political self-determination into a context of religious faith. It was a big influence on him. Last Sunday, he visited Switzerland’s Black Madonna of Einsiedeln, he tells me. “It was amazing to see the power of this crazy, powerful set of symbols all around. I was like, the Catholic church has this figured out! That people need things, in order to get from themselves to the thing to beyond the thing.” Gates directs me to another piece he is installing: on the walls around his tar Madonna runs a continuous bookshelf that will contain 2,500 volumes, identically bound in black, with gold lettering. The books are another of his salvage missions: they were acquired from bookshops gone out of business and closed-down libraries, and are on African American subjects. He has arranged them so their titles can be read as a continuous poem, an “index to black experience”, as he puts it. Or as a prayer: When We March Come Out Smoking With Cloaks of Invisibility Giants With Wonder Spooks by Doors Martyrs When Necessary, and so forth. “If people have a moment to read my prayer, it means they’re also praying,” he says. Editions of this prayerpoem will be published throughout the exhibition in the room next door, which contains a heavy, 1960s Heidelberg printing press. Gates has borrowed it from the Basel Paper Mill museum, just up the road. “I almost feel like one part of the project is about me being a kind of new jack propagandist,” he says. “I’m Black Madonna Press, and my goal is the redissemination of the black image.”This is another of those through-lines that connects Gates’s work. Much of it concerns history things that might be lost or forgotten – saving them, preserving them, repurposing, reinserting them into cultural narratives, changing the situation. “One way I think about power is the ability to resurrect things that have been sleeping for a long time,” he agrees. It could be a condemned building or shop of discarded books or a 1960s image of an African American model, her hair straightened into a dynamic bob. Or it might be Knuckles’ record collection, which came to Gates simply because of his reputation for collecting things and liking house music. Rather than buying the records, Gates suggested Knuckles license them to him for 10 years. He invites DJs to come to his bank building and spin them and make mixtapes out of them. “It’s not about acquisition. The goal is to have these things keep circulating.”Spreading the word, resurrecting the dead, writing prayers, chanting with his Black Monks, positing his mother as the Virgin Mary (and therefore himself as Jesus) – the connections between art and religion are not lost on Gates, and there is the implication he’s positing himself as a spiritual leader, but he would rather frame it as an ongoing process of enquiry.Gates doesn’t go to church any more, but the church is always in him, he says. As a teenager, he was director of his local church youth choir. He once questioned whether to become an artist or a priest, a preacher or a scholar, a student of religion or of art. To some extent, they’ve all merged, Gates says. “Using the term ‘art’ gives me more latitude.”He develops the thought. “I’m really trying to find my place in a world of forms material and immaterial,” he says. “Even though I may have some questions about the form of God or the form that the immaterial world takes, I have no doubt about the truth of its presence. Eighty per cent of my practice is about reaching those things out of an immaterial world and trying to manifest them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ccf8539ce2e447bdcb694638265dca13fff0738/69_262_4754_2854/master/4754.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9deec1b88e3a9ce2a4f21cf9cbcf3db6","title":"global visions the 49th arles photography festival in pictures","story":"Robert Frank, Laura Henno, and Feng Li are featured at this huge event exploring everything from African spirituality to marriage in China and death in Ukraine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a1ba00bde2e8a4b022d37c826b89279c63e342e/0_241_4874_2924/master/4874.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85db3f018be20cada6e9e2eeb3067924","title":"women in health tech designing solutions and transforming lives across society","story":"Women are underrepresented in the field of technology – but these three entrepreneurs are at the forefront of digital health development and leading the fight for a more inclusive industryIt’s easy to conjure up images of Elon Musk and Steve Jobs when we think about the tech industry, but the often-unrecognised heroes of technology are the women spearheading new companies and inventions. This year sees the annual AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme return, with new categories including the Women Entrepreneurs in Health Tech award, created to encourage and support women pioneering some of the most innovative health technology.It’s certainly not that women aren’t enthused by the world of technology. We’ve spoken to three finalists, budding health tech entrepreneurs – who happen to also be women – to find out about their experiences within the industry.BrightSign develops communication tech for children and sign language users. Its founder, Hadeel Ayoub, travelled with a team to South Korea during her PhD studies to take part in a global hackathon, entering a smart glove that translates sign language into text or speech. They won the competition, which led her to develop the technology further and create BrightSign.“The tech arena in general is definitely male dominated. In digital health specifically, when I take part in trade shows or give a talk in a conference, most often I am the only woman on the programme. I am not necessarily treated differently, but the look of surprise on people’s faces when I am walking to the podium, into a meeting or presenting my technology cannot be overlooked. My name doesn’t always give me away as a woman, so it has happened to me several times that I am mistaken for the assistant while ‘Mr Hadeel’ is coming shortly.”Although Ayoub is encouraged by the progress the industry is making when it comes to being more inclusive to women, she sometimes feels she can be treated like a box to tick.“I feel I have been invited to events so they can even out the numbers and check the inclusivity and ersity boxes. That’s a shame, because I would rather be included for my work, not my gender.“I have to say that in the past couple of months, I have been very happy to see other female names presenting, and CEOs no less. There are a few women in tech in London. We have joined together and meet up regularly to share our challenges and support each other.”Hsin-Hua Yu, known as Sheana, was inspired by her own experiences with scoliosis (curvature of the spine) to create Aergo, a low-cost, inconspicuous postural support system. Sheana, who graduated with a double master’s in global innovation design at the Royal College of Art and Imperial College London, was motivated by a research visit where she met with young people who used wheelchairs but struggled to sit comfortably and maintain a healthy posture.“Students and carers complained about the social stigma caused by not being able to sit upright, which led to people excluding them from conversations or activities. This motivated me to create a solution that helps children to break free from the need for constant assistance and build their self-confidence,” she says.Despite her complex and life-changing work, Sheana feels she faces something of an uphill struggle to be taken seriously.“As a female founder, I feel I have more to prove in front of colleagues, investors and business partners. I find the medical industry is particularly male-dominated and this can sometimes be quite intimidating. I’ve learned that by being clear, firm and professional, people begin to look past my gender and see me for my abilities.”Sheana would like to see a more “inclusive” health tech industry in future.“I’d like to see health tech designing solutions for all members of society. A lot of health tech today focuses on the medical condition and not the person. This often leads to a solution that can contribute to prejudice and social stigma. I believe in creating tech that is accessible to a wider range of users because it has the power to transform lives, remove social barriers, and change perceptions of disability within our culture.” Before creating iBreve, Wahl was working at Google’s legal department in Dublin and Boston. While travelling with her co-creator in Rishikesh, India – known as the yoga capital of the world – the pair saw an opportunity to combine breathing techniques from eastern culture with the western world and its modern stresses.“The growing trend of mindfulness and the increasing popularity of wearables reinforced our endeavour,” says Wahl. “We decided to focus initially on women’s health and wellbeing. So we designed a beautiful and discreet wearable that attaches to the bra and helps to improve stress resilience by analysing breathing patterns with machine learning.”Wahl wants to inspire more women and more ersity as a whole in the tech world.“Inspiring more girls and women to join the tech world is going to contribute to this ersity and benefits society with better answers to the current big challenges we face. My time at Google and at iBreve showed me that working together with a erse team from different backgrounds and with different experiences is productive, insightful and fun.”She would encourage women wanting to break into the health tech industry – and the tech industry as a whole – to listen to their instincts and follow what comes naturally.“The most important thing is to believe in yourself and do what you are passionate about. Trust your instincts and share your ideas and passion with others.”We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream.

From the romantic notion of the outlaw antihero to the caricature of the psychotic mob boss, they have been portrayed in many different lights but the unifying theme is that they live by a set of rules alien to the law-abiding public, and that makes them fascinating. We want to know what makes them tick, to understand their world and to see it in all its bloody reality. It’s the essence of what makes a good thriller: showing us a violent existence from the safety of an armchair.I never set out to write about gangsters. My first novel, The Dark Inside, was based on the Texarkana Moonlight Murders, a 1946 serial-killing case. The sequel, Black Night Falling, saw my protagonist, Charlie Yates, drawn back to Arkansas, to the town of Hot Springs – a real-life mob town in the 1940s where illegal gambling and prostitution flourished. That’s when serendipity came into play: in researching the book, I discovered that Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel was at that time a regular visitor to Hot Springs. Having one of history’s most famous gangsters in such proximity to my story was too good a chance to pass up, and in my new novel, Cold Desert Sky, Siegel takes centre stage. Set in Los Angeles and Las Vegas during the construction of Siegel’s Flamingo Hotel, it sees Charlie investigating the disappearance of two Hollywood starlets while trying to dodge Bugsy. His only care is staying alive long enough to find the missing girls, but LA is Siegel’s town …Here’s my pick of the gangster books I’ve read over the years: 1. The Godfather by Mario PuzoAn obvious choice, perhaps, but a reflection of how seminal it is to the genre. Francis Ford Coppola’s film adaptation is regarded as one of the greatest of all time, but the book is a classic in its own right. It introduced terms like Cosa Nostra and omertà to a mass audience and defined the public perception of mobsters for decades to come.2. Wiseguy by Nicholas PileggiAdapted by Martin Scorsese as the film Goodfellas, Pileggi’s account of the life of mobster Henry Hill was the starting point for the modern-day depiction of the gangster. The book set the template for all that followed - from Casino and Donnie Brasco right through to The Sopranos.3. American Tabloid by James EllroyEllroy dedicates his masterpiece to “bad men, and the price they paid to secretly define their time”. Covering the period from JFK’s election to his assassination, Ellroy takes us into the world of thugs, fixers and killers on the fringes of power. It still amazes me that in 600 pages, the closest thing to a hero is a hitman who by his own reckoning has killed more than 500 people. It was accused of glorifying criminals, but I prefer Ellroy’s own explanation: this is a story of three men crushed by the weight of their own evil.4. The Power of the Dog by Don WinslowWinslow’s novel chronicles the first 30 years of the US’s “war on drugs”. Epic in every sense, the book lays bare the violence, futility and hypocrisy of the policy, and is made all the more striking by its grounding in true events. But this is much more than a fictional exposé of recent history as in The Godfather, it’s the personal relationships that drive the narrative as the friendship between DEA agent Art Keller and narco kingpin Miguel Angel Barrera disintegrates into a blood feud.5. LA Confidential by James EllroyFor my money, Ellroy’s five-book run from The Big Nowhere to The Cold Six Thousand is as strong as any crime author has put together. LA Confidential focuses on the LA mob scene after Siegel, but takes in LAPD corruption, institutional racism, high-class prostitution and more. Sprawling and complex, yet exquisitely plotted, it’s the pathos Ellroy imbues in his tough guys that sets this apart. That and the fact that it features the villainous Dudley Smith at his absolute zenith.6. Muscle for the Wing by Daniel WoodrellWoodrell’s later works such as Winter’s Bone are more famous but I love this fast and violent novel about a gang of ex-cons muscling in on a town run by the southern mob. Woodrell has never wasted a word, and this is no different: the local crime boss, for instance, “measured five foot seven standing on your neck”. You would struggle to find any heroes to root for here, but Woodrell doesn’t care about that. Pacy, hard-boiled thrillers aren’t hard to find, but ones that are written with this precision, this memorable a voice, are a rare thing.7. The Neon Rain by James Lee BurkeBurke’s first novel in the Robicheaux series sees him running up against New Orleans crime boss “Didi Gee” Giacano. Omnipotent and universally feared at the outset, by the end Didi Gee’s got a litany of problems: the law is closing in, the cartels are moving on his turf and his health is failing. A corpulent, complacent kingpin, his story arc comes to symbolise the decline of the mafia’s underworld stranglehold in the face of newcomers with new rules.8. Live By Night by Dennis LehaneThis is the other side of the coin: Lehane’s sweeping novel charts the rise of Joe Coughlin from the streets of Boston to Florida mob boss. Lehane’s fearlessness as a writer is in evidence here once again – not just in the change in period and setting from his earlier works, but in the ambition of the novel’s scope. By turns a gritty mobster epic, a coming-of-age story and a cautionary tale about the price of success, at its heart this is a story of love and loss – and one that seems constructed to deliver an inevitably happy ending only to sidestep it, twice, in a manner probably only Lehane could pull off.9. The Rules of Wolfe by James Carlos BlakeBlake’s tale of Texan gun runners starts with one of the most breathless action sequences I’ve read – an arms deal at sea goes bad, resulting in a showdown with cartel killers in a pitch-black coastal lagoon. The climax sees a wounded man begging for a bullet before the crabs can eat him alive. Blake doesn’t deal in sentiment. The writing is taut and spare throughout, the tension never lets up, and this is as dark as noir gets. But there’s a literary quality to it that elevates this above the norm, and the later stages evoke Cormac McCarthy’s works set in the same border badlands.10. After Hours by Edwin TorresTorres’s work opens up the rarely featured world of Puerto Rican gangs in Spanish Harlem. It is the second book in the series, and this time Carlito Brigante is older and wiser and looking for a way out of the life – and anyone familiar with the genre knows that never goes well. The book hums with authenticity, and Brigante is a standout character: a killer and a survivor, but smart and thoughtful with it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2e2954475227c00d355c2f1acb4e1f8b81936b7/114_144_3377_2026/master/3377.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e8db96a2991ffb3ae5814ba88fc36c5","title":"weekend new york benjamin markovits review tennis novel","story":"The opening round of a tennis grand slam contains as many endings as it does beginnings. That stage can resemble a bloodbath the starting pistol wipes out half the field. It’s hard to say who has it worse: the challengers tossed into the stadium to\u0026nbspbe gobbled up like chum or those left to die lonely deaths on the courts near the car park. For the favourites, these crowded Mondays and Tuesdays offer a chance to find their range and rhythm. But for the rest they are a desperate bid for survival. Hundreds of stories are cut short before they even get under way.A Weekend in New York, Ben Markovits’s elegant, absorbing eighth novel, spotlights the preparations of Paul Essinger, a journeyman pro in his 30s poised to compete in his last US Open. Essinger is scheduled on Court 12 against Borisov, a hard-charging Bulgarian ranked a\u0026nbspfew places above him. If he loses, it’s over he’ll announce his retirement. Once off the tour, he plans to\u0026nbspplough his winnings into a parcel of land out in Texas. This unnerves his ex-model wife, who figured he’d stay in the city and maybe move into TV. “It sounds to me like you’re going off the rails a little bit,” she says.Markovits played professional basketball in his youth (documented in his\u0026nbsp2010 novel Playing Days) and wears his sporting knowledge with a light, limber confidence. He’s terrific on the fine-grained detail of the athlete’s life: the mental tricks one plays to remain in the zone the practice sessions with friends that are not entirely friendly. But he also connects this action to a wider frame, showing how the impending finale of Essinger’s career\u0026nbsphas brought family tensions into focus.The tale bounces from the player to land on his brother, sister and parents, who have gathered in New York ahead of Monday’s match. It mines their German-Jewish ancestry, skips away from the action to scrutinise his sister’s affair and brother’s controversial appointment as acting assistant attorney general, and picks at the scabs of his mother’s childhood in Berlin. The Essingers are educated and middle class, generally at ease on Manhattan’s moneyed Upper West Side, with traces of Salinger’s Glass family or Wes Anderson’s Tenenbaums in their DNA. They have done well for themselves, come up in the world. “Immigrant’s luck,” reflects Essinger Sr gloomily, although it’s unclear whether he thinks that all this humdrum good fortune has been somehow unearned or whether he fears that it is about to run dry.What a fine ear Markovits has for the way people talk. His dialogue put me in mind of David Mamet’s remark that modern US drama is mainly about people not talking to each other. One by one, the Essingers come under fire, but they counter with deft defensive tactics. They change the subject, alter the pace and send the conversation spinning off at awkward angles. Each exchange is a prolonged, expert rally, with the book as the ball, bearing the imprint of each family member in turn.A Weekend in New York opens with the old Tolstoy line about all happy families being alike. Yet while the Essingers are anxious, fearful and frequently at loggerheads, I’m not sure they can be counted as unhappy, exactly. These characters are too vivid, too present, too invested in their interlocking (and perhaps irresolvable) problems. They may feel that they’re losing, but they are still in the game.On Monday, the family piles aboard a subway carriage to take the slow ride out to the National Tennis Centre at Flushing Meadows, and by this point the reader has become deeply invested. Incrementally, over the course of the weekend, we’ve grown attuned to the lives of Markovits’s first-world also-rans, thrilled by their series of close-volley dramas like spectators in the stands of an outside court. These players aren’t titans and their back-and-forth contest is a side show at best. It’s just that in the moment it feels momentous, a catalyst for change, and the outcome sends ripples into the future.• Xan Brooks’s The Clocks in This House All Tell Different Times is published by Salt. • A Weekend in New York is published by Faber.

After suffering during the heavy snow earlier this year, when diggers and cranes were forced to fall idle across the country, bright sunshine and warmer weather over the past month helped builders back to work.According to the latest survey from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, there was the largest upturn in buying construction materials for two-and-a-half years in June.The gauge of activity on the purchasing managers index – closely watched by the Bank for signs of economic strength – rose to 53.1 from 52.5 in May, hitting the highest level in seven months against economists’ expectations of a static reading. Anything above 50 on the PMI reflects growth in economic activity rather than contraction.The rebound for the industry could suggest much of the weakness earlier this year was the result of the “beast from the east” and was not triggered by a broader malaise for the building trade.Dismissing the fears of a slowdown on Tuesday, Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank’s rate-setting monetary policy committee, said the UK economy was continuing to grow at a modest and steady pace, similar to the average of the past couple of years.In an interview with CNBC, Saunders warned that interest rates would need to rise should the UK economy continue to show signs of strength. “If the economy plays out as I expect, it may be that rates need to go up a little faster,” he said.Threadneedle Street delayed raising the cost of borrowing after weak economic data in the wake of heavy snowfall earlier this year, although the Bank has since opened the door for an interest rate hike in August. The Office for National Statistics also revised higher its estimate for economic growth in the first quarter, thanks to better readings from the construction industry.Observers said big-ticket infrastructure projects such as the expansion of Heathrow – backed by MPs last week – and HS2 would be crucial to ensuring the UK remains an infrastructure leader on the world stage after Britain leaves the EU. Brexit uncertainty has caused some businesses to put construction projects on hold in recent months, which could make government spending key for encouraging firms to invest in Britain.Optimism was strongest outside London in the IHS MarkitCips survey, with particular strength seen in the north-west, West Midlands and Bristol. While the house building industry drove much of the growth there were fewer new projects for civil engineers, holding back stronger growth. Despite the better news, Samuel Tombs of the economics consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics said the outlook remained bleak for the year ahead as the UK leaves the EU. He said the proportion of builders in the survey expecting activity to increase over the next year remains was well below the 20-year average for the poll.Max Jones of Lloyds Bank said: “The sector is hardly motoring, with some large contractors blaming Brexit uncertainty for the delay or cancellation of projects.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9533c11ad65bac5273a5ce2b82b864b9116ca29d/0_38_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e3694d9dcbca7479eb1468d03bbd8ad","title":"pay rises faster for top 1 per cent of earners in developed world report","story":"OECD says wage growth is still ‘missing in action’ across 35 nations it representsDespite more people being in work than at any time since the onset of the banking crisis a decade ago, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said wage growth was still “missing in action” across the 35 countries represented by the Paris-based group of wealthy nations.The OECD said unemployment rates are now below, or close to, pre-crisis levels across its membership base, which should give workers the right conditions to demand higher pay and better conditions.Launching its annual employment outlook report for 2018, Stefano Scarpetta, the OECD’s director of employment, labour and social affairs, said the most worrying finding was “this unprecedented wage stagnation is not evenly distributed across workers”.“While jobs are finally back, only some fortunate few at the top are also enjoying improvements in earnings and job quality,” he said.Finding multiple reasons why wage growth appears to be the missing element of the current upswing for the world economy, the OECD said one of the most important factors was the slowdown in productivity growth since the crisis.It warned the measure of growth in economic output per hour of work had dropped by about half, acting as a drag on wage rises as companies have been unable to generate higher profits with the same resources – required to pay their staff more. The Bank of England has argued wage growth in Britain should gradually begin to rise with the unemployment rate at the lowest level since the mid-1970s. However, there are few signs of wage growth.Some leading economists have warned the rise of the gig economy, part-time jobs and other precarious forms of work such as zero-hours contracts have eroded the power of employees to demand higher pay.Millions of jobs were lost during the financial crisis, and the OECD said many of the new roles people have taken in the decade since may not be as good as the ones they had before.Several governments, including Britain’s, have implemented sweeping cuts to out-of-work benefits as they implement austerity measures, which could have put downward pressure on wage growth, according to the OECD. While unemployment rates have fallen dramatically, the organisation said cuts to benefits meant many workers had been forced to take worse jobs than the ones they had before the crash and as such were continuing to apply for work. When more people apply for a role, or are waiting to take a position, it diminishes the bargaining power of employees to demand higher pay.The report said: “The jobs destroyed during the crisis are not the same as those created in the recovery.” As many as one-in-three jobseekers across the OECD receive unemployment benefits on average, although it said this was falling as part of a long-term downward trend since the crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7571f5e61f7f17381531ffb4a30d9491aadbcfcd/0_327_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dd0e4a25234cb637afebbd1abc21376","title":"from solar torches to bioloos five frugal innovations from around the world","story":"Not everyone wants to send rockets into space. For these innovators, a cheap, effective, no-frills product is the goalWhether it’s bringing quality healthcare closer to those residing in rural villages or providing people with facilities as basic and necessary as toilets, it’s sometimes wise not to overcomplicate things. Frugal innovation, based on the Indian concept of jugaad – innovating when there are limitations in resources – can provide an answer when capital is low, resources are scarce, or infrastructure is in need of upgrading.Here are five businesses putting frugality at the forefront of innovation.Peek Vision works with partners to improve access to high-quality eye care using the Peek Acuity and Peek Acuity Pro smartphone vision-test apps, and Peek Retina, a smartphone adapter for examining inside the eye. The apps, which are designed by eye care professionals, enable anyone to examine a patient’s eyes and assess the quality of their sight. The patient is shown a letter in the app and has to identify it as it increases and decreases in size and changes direction. The patient’s answers are graded by the app, which also determines their score at the end of the test.For people living in remote parts of the world, accessing healthcare can mean travelling a considerable distance – especially problematic when there are medical emergencies.With ClickMedix, an app that enables health workers to screen, diagnose and refer patients on for treatment, villagers can avoid the lengthy travel times – and the associated costs. The app works by taking local health professionals through a questionnaire, guiding them to ask patients appropriate questions and then directing them to the relevant treatment or referral options. The app can be used to screen patients for a number of conditions, including HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.Ting Shih, ClickMedix CEO and founder, says: “What’s important about frugal innovation is that you’re empowering the local people to see the power and to know that there are solutions and to help deliver the solutions, which then actually enables true adoption.”From shopping to streaming, the internet has changed the way many of us conduct our everyday lives - but the same isn’t true for rural areas with poor connectivity.Launching across the Ivory Coast this July, Dor2Dor – a delivery service powered by Be-Bound’s augmented connectivity technology – is set to transform the delivery landscape for people in remote areas. Parcels will be delivered within 48 hours, including to homes without conventional addresses. Deloitte estimates that over five years Dor2Dor will create 100,000 new jobs directly, and a further 500,000 indirectly.Mélanie Delaroche Curtil, communications assistant at Be-Bound, says: “The beauty of frugal innovation is that it is right in front of us. It is making something new with something old.” The award-winning Frontier Markets collaborates with consumers and local entrepreneurs on solutions that put the customer first. Its solar torch, designed by and for rural women, is one example. Women living in rural India are disproportionately affected by the negative effects of limited access to energy and have fewer income-generating opportunities. They can use the torches for personal use or be trained to sell them. The torch costs less than $20 and is more efficient than market alternatives that use lead-acid batteries. Currently, Frontier Markets works across 22 districts in Rajasthan with a network of 1,000 women entrepreneurs.In response to India’s often-limited sanitation facilities – with 626 million people practicing open defecation – Banka BioLoo was born. The brainchild of Namita Banka, the company’s chief executive and founder, bioloos tackle the lack of secure, dignified and eco-friendly places to go to the toilet in some areas of India.The bioloos treat human waste with bacterial cultures, meaning off-site disposal and treatment of excrement is not required. As a result, transport of human waste is eliminated, reducing pollution. And, because the bioloos are found in 20 states across India, in everything from trains and schools to communities and hospitals, more people can safely use the toilet, decreasing instances of open defecation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bd2829520384706c4a631eeaa8048b1874f91a6/21_0_4959_2976/master/4959.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e6f2c05ff8616ed406bcc2c5d8e9e4b","title":"in big tech v big retail the real losers are store workers sears amazon","story":"It’s becoming a common story across America: the opening of an Amazon ‘fulfilment center’ hastens the end of local department stores, like this Sears in Sacramento Photographs by Robert GumpertIn the Sacramento area of northern California, an Amazon fulfilment centre came online last year, striking, it would seem, another blow to the local outlets of Sears, one of America’s signature brick and mortar department stories. spoke to Sears workers at the Sunrise Mall in Citrus Heights who were told earlier this year the store would be closing down. That Sears store and another outlet nearby in Roseville are slated to close by 15 July, following announcements by the Sears Holding Company in March and April heralding the closure of more than 100 stores.“Since April, the inventory here is being handled by a liquidation company, so it doesn’t sync with Sears’ website. People might say ‘This cost $63 online’, but we might sell it to them for $53. Or $73.It’s sad. Customers are coming up to me and saying how they’ve been shopping here for 40 years. Our older employees who’ve been here a while all live nearby. So, yeah, it’s rough. What will I do when the store closes? I’ll go back to college. And apply to work at Costco.”“I got here four months ago and, my first day on the job, they announced the store is closing. I had hoped to make some money, to look after myself, to help my dad with the bills. But all of those hopes went down.Later this month there will be an expo for other stores to come and interview our employees and see if any of us are a good match for them. After the initial announcement, a couple of workers quit. One guy had been here 20 years, and they’d never raised his pay. He was earning $11 an hour, like me.Would I work at the nearby Amazon fulfilment center? I didn’t know there was one. Yeah, I’d be interested in that.”“I got here in 1998 – 20 years ago! But after 9-11 I was called up by the air force reserves and spent three years in Qatar. So I’ve been here parts of 17 years. I’ve been down here on the bottom floor long enough that I’ve pretty much mastered the art of selling. This was a day we all kind of saw coming. There was the recession, and we never really bounced back from the real-estate crisis, and Amazon took off in 2011 or so. So I predicted this, but I thought we’d have a little more time. As recently as three years ago, this store was still in tip-top shape. But then the losses to Amazon really began mounting up. These last three-to-five years is when it really began to show. How did I react when I got the news the store was closing? Well, it was my birthday. I got an email. Thankfully, we had already gone out to eat and I didn’t find out until the end of the night. And I was shocked … but not totally shocked. I am retired air force, but I’ll still need to work. I will press on, possibly with Sears. Post-9-11, I’ve been thinking of getting into healthcare, so I could help people out. And there are opportunities with Gulfstream (the aerospace company). And I may just take some time off. I live right here in Citrus Heights. I walk to work. I am going to miss that.”“The tragedy for the community is a demographic one. People are ageing out. I’ve lived here more than 20 years I’ve seen all this. People are going online or going to specialty stores. So Sears is experiencing what every traditional American business is: there’s pressure to either enhance the personal connection, or it’s super-duper price-driven. I understand this because I worked in supermarkets for years, and the trend is either toward Whole Foods or, on the other end of the spectrum, toward Walmart. It’s a real polarisation.Also, our being in the middle of suburbia is not ideal we’re 20 or 30 minutes from the freeway, depending on traffic. I recently completed my master’s in Asian and Pacific studies at the University of San Francisco. This store’s closure was both gradual and sudden – like the death of a loved one. And for me, as an aspiring academic, this is both a gentle push and an abrupt shove.”“Our parents shopped at Sears, as did our parents’ parents. So it’s real sad. This is an old store, and most Sears are old. I’ve been here, I don’t even know how many years. I’ve lost count. More than 20. It’s my home away from home. And it’s hard to find another home, especially when you get older. This store is closing because of – what do you call it? – Amazon. People shopping online. But this store was in the black! Our lease was not renewed Sears did not own this building, it sold it and was leasing it back. And now I bet they’re gonna tear it down.Our last day here is June 23 and our last selling day is the ninth. And, on top of that, we were ripped off the other night. Two guys got our Oakley and Ray-Ban frames, like, 76 of them. They’re worth like $170 to $200 a frame that’s about $14,000. It’s just the icing on the cake. What a punch in the gut. I use that clock for all my clients. After they put on their glasses, I ask them, ‘Can you see that clock? What time is it?’ It’s sad: the kids, they don’t know how to tell time on an analogue clock.”“I go around the store talking to people about improvements in their home – roofs, bathrooms, kitchens – and set up appointments. I am the only person in the store doing this. After this store closes, I am going to be reassigned to either the Arden Fair mall or our outlet at McClellan air force base. How do I feel about that? If they put me at McClellan, it’ll be more convenient for me than it is now.”After this? I got an offer. From Sam’s Jewelers, here in the mall. But I want a break. After 10 years I want a break. I volunteer at Casa Garden, which benefits the Sacramento Children’s Home. My husband is a master gardener at UC Davis. We are going to do some gardening. And I have two sons who are doctors – a surgeon in Texas and an ear-nose-throat specialist in West Virginia. I am going to do some travelling. Look, I don’t want to shop on the internet I want to put my hands on the materials. A lot of people are like that. Especially our older customers. They know us. They are our regulars.

But in its original home of Seattle, critics say rising house prices and growing inequality have ruined the cityImage shows Seattle from 2015 to 2017by  Chris McGreal in SeattleHowever they see Amazon, for good or ill, residents of the fastest-growing city in the US largely agree on the price Seattle has paid to be the home of the megacorporation: surging rents, homelessness, traffic-clogged streets, overburdened public transport, an influx of young men in polo shirts and a creeping uniformity rubbing against the city’s counterculture.But the issue of Jeff Bezos’s balls is far from settled. “Have you seen the Bezos balls?” asked Dave Christie, a jewellery maker at a waterfront market who makes no secret of his personal dislike for the man who founded and still runs Amazon. “No one wanted them. They’ve disfigured downtown. Giant balls say everything about the man. Bezos is holding Seattle hostage.”It’s not strictly true to say everyone is against the three huge plant-forested glass spheres at what Amazon calls its “campus” in the heart of the city. The Bezos balls, as the conservatories are popularly known, are modelled on the greenhouses at London’s Kew Gardens, feature walkways above fig trees, ferns and rhododendrons, and provide hot-desking for Amazon workers looking for a break from the neighbouring office tower. “They are absolutely gorgeous. There was nothing in that area 10 years ago,” said Jen Reed, selling jerky from another market stall. “I don’t hate Amazon the way that a lot of people hate them. Seattle has changed a lot. My rent’s gone from $500 to $1,000, but outside of that Amazon have been beneficial. It’s give and take, and anyway we invited them here.”But even those sympathetic to the biggest retailer in the US are questioning whether there has been more take than give. Amazon has long been accused of stretching the city’s transit and education systems, and its highly paid workers have driven up prices of goods and housing.The resentful murmur recently became a roar after Amazon reacted to the city’s latest tax proposal, which would have charged large businesses an annual $275 per employee, by resorting to what critics call blackmail. In mid-June, less than a month after unanimously passing the tax, Seattle’s council abandoned it in the face of threats from the corporation. The tension has sharpened the debate about whether the city can retain its identity as one of the most progressive in the country, or is destined to be just another tech hub.Ironically, given Amazon’s much-publicised “city sweepstakes”, in which municipalities in North America are competing to land the company’s second headquarters, Seattle did not reach a Faustian pact with Amazon to lure it in the first place. The city gave no tax breaks and passed no anti-union laws, although the fact that Washington state law bars income tax was certainly appealing. The council did encourage the firm’s massive growth, however, with accommodations on building regulations that helped drive $4bn in construction.John Burbank of the Economic Opportunity Institute said there is a a direct link between the surge in highly paid jobs and the numbers of people forced on to the street.Amazon has sought to improve its standing with financial support for organisations such as Mary’s Place to build a new shelter for 200 homeless women and families. It is a similar story as schools and public transportation grapple to keep up with the rapidly rising population and the demographic shift it is causing.  But still the flow of cars to the Amazon campus has led to long traffic jams to the interstate. The bus route to the same area, the No 8, is notorious as one of the most overcrowded and delayed in the city, prompting a derisory Twitter account with the slogan “You can’t say late without 8!”.In other cities, rising salaries would be a boon to public coffers, but, Seattle is burdened with one of the most regressive tax systems in the country.“As a result we’re leaving millions of dollars on the table that should be going into public investments in our state and in our city. We’re increasing taxes on the people who can least afford to pay taxes and we’re letting the affluent off the hook.”This is not how large numbers of people in Seattle think things should work. They argue that Amazon should contribute to upgrading a transport system that’s struggling under the influx it created, and improving schools that provide the educated workforce the company benefits from. “It is sort of a bipolar relationship because we do have a progressive city in some respects, we have a progressive city council in some respects, and then we have an environment that embraces inidual wealth,” said Burbank.“So if it has to do with personal freedom, that’s OK. But if it has to do with actually trying to create a shared quality of life which entails taxation of the affluent or higher taxation, that’s not OK. And so this is a really good city for him because we have a lot of personal freedom and we have no taxation. Of course chickens are going to come home to roost at some point.” Bezos’s company has arguably done much to erode the liberal and progressive culture of the city that first attracted him. Unlike other locally based giant corporations such as Microsoft, Starbucks and Boeing, Amazon planted itself in the heart of the city, and the influx of well-paid tech workers has changed the feel of Seattle. Keenan-Lai sees it in the erosion of the identity of her old neighbourhood on the city’s Capitol Hill and the disappearance of older, quirky restaurants, driven out by newer, more polished places. “I can’t begrudge people moving to try to find opportunity,” she said. “But I do hear a lot of people say ‘I don’t want those programmers coming to Seattle’. It does create a lot of tension. Amazon represents both innovation and progress, and also dystopian fears for a lot of folks.” Reed, at the market stall, added: “It’s definitely weird when you go into a e bar that used to have bike gangs and now everyone’s in a polo shirt.”The city council has struggled to find a path that remains true to Seattle’s progressive values while keeping the source of much of its recent prosperity happy. In 2015 it became the first major US city to increase its minimum wage to $15 an hour. Keenan-Lai said 100,000 people – then quarter of the working population of the city – benefited from the measure, but that its impact was swiftly eroded. “The increase in the cost of housing has exceeded the increase in wages,” she said. “When we were advocating for $15 an hour the idea was that everyone who lived in Seattle could afford to live here. Our housing market just skyrocketed.”Seattle, forced by the lack of an income tax to hunt for innovative means of raising revenue, has run into resistance from Amazon at every turn. The friction peaked over the recent worker tax, which was expected to raise around $50m a year to help pay for affordable housing and services for people made homeless by escalating rents and property prices. Amazon, however, in actions critics called blackmail, characterised it as a “jobs tax”, threatened to freeze construction in the city and backed a petition drive to put the issue to a popular vote in November.The city’s chamber of commerce and other businesses threw their weight behind the ballot initiative. Popular support for the measure collapsed amid accusations that it would cost jobs and that the money would not be put to good use because the council lacks a coherent strategy to cope with the homeless crisis. Under pressure from Amazon, the council broke, and only two of the city’s nine councillors voted to keep the tax. One of them, Kshama Sawant, a member of Socialist Alternative, accused the council of a “cowardly betrayal” and called Bezos “our enemy”.Sawant, a driving force behind the $15 minimum wage, said it would be a mistake to expect Amazon to behave any differently. The company, she said, could easily afford the tax but opposed it for ideological reasons.“It’s not a tax on jobs,” she said. “It is not a tax on employees. It’s a tax on big business. For the people who would actually be paying this, it is pocket change, and yet they are fighting fiercely against it. ‘Good corporate citizen’ is an oxymoron, because Jeff Bezos and the billionaire class have no incentive to do the right thing.”Amazon has said that while it opposed the worker tax, it is “deeply committed to being part of the solution”, and points to its support of nonprofits in the city. The company declined to comment for this article.Critics are not persuaded. Some see the company as attempting to shape a future in which Seattle’s residents are dependent on Amazon’s largesse through the funding of NGOs to deal with social issues, giving the company undue power at the expense of democratic institutions. “Amazon is very much, ‘We want to save the world too, let’s do it together.’ And then as you get into the details, not so much,” said Keenan-Lai. “There is a lot of benefit we provide to Amazon but the city has had a really hard time extracting benefit from the company in return.” Still, Keenan-Lai said the city’s history of progressive struggle is deep-rooted. “There’s been a long understanding that corporations can’t continue doing what they’re doing,” she said. “In Seattle, we’ve been fighting back for a long time.”This week  Cities takes a deeper look at the relationship between tech and US cities, asking whether tax giveaways are worth the cost.

But the trend for exclusive networking groups aimed at wealthy women only sets back gender equalityOff the coast of Finland, immured in the Baltic Sea, there is a private island where men are banned and only a select few women, with suitably large bank accounts, are allowed to set foot. It is called SuperShe Island and it is the international headquarters of the SuperShe society.When I first heard about this women-only island, I thought – rather hopefully – that it might be a SuperSapphic version of Love Island. Desert Island Dykes, perhaps? No such luck. There is nothing filthy about SuperShe Island rather, it is all about the lucre. SuperShe, you see, is basically an upmarket networking group for well-off women. If you have €4,000 (£3,500) to spare and you are willing to undergo a rigorous interview, it offers you the chance to spend the week on a “wellness” retreat miles from men, mingling with other affluent, influential women.Before any men start getting indignant, I should make it clear that SuperShe Island is not the product of a man-hating mind far from it. As Kristina Roth, the founder of SuperShe, explains on the website: “Women need to spend time with other women. Being on vacation with men can cause women to become sidetracked, whether it’s to put on a swipe of lipstick or grab for a cover-up.”It was quite the education reading this I had no idea straight women were so easily distracted by putting on lipstick for men. It made me worry about heterosexual people.SuperShe Island also offers lots of yoga (it is basically illegal not to do yoga at upmarket retreats), organic food and various life-improving exercises, including cognitive exercises to expel negative thoughts. I would love to know exactly how these cognitive exercises work, because the more I read about SuperShe Island (it has had a ton of press lately – there is something about banning men that seems to get people interested), the more my brain was besieged by negative thoughts. What fresh faux-feminist hell is this, I wondered. Please tell me this is not yet another example of a newly minted women-only space painting itself as empowering when it is clearly elitist?I say “yet another example”, because there has been a boom in bouji spaces exclusive to women. There is the Wing, for example, a fashionable women-only co-working space and social club with locations across the US and a space in London on the way. Membership costs from $2,350 (£1,800) a year and there is a waiting list. Then there is the AllBright, an exclusive women-only members’ club in London that opened earlier this year and costs at least £975 to join. There is Women Fest, too, the UK’s first all-female festival, which is scheduled to take place in August. (It costs £225 to attend, but some of the profits will go to a tree charity, so I guess that is OK.) I could go on, but you get the picture: the old boys’ club is being challenged.“Do you think I have big dyke energy?” I asked my girlfriend the other day. She looked me up and down and sighed. “Is this a Twitter thing? You really need to spend less time on Twitter, you know.”While it is true that I should spend less time on Twitter, the social network is also an invaluable source of useless information. Last week, for example, Twitter brought the concept of “big dick energy” into the national consciousness. A single tweet launched a thousand explainers in outlets ranging from the BBC to GQ to the . If you missed the column inches devoted to the concept, it basically means being hugely confident.But enough with the phalluses, please. Let’s talk about BDE 2.0, which is big dyke energy. The internet is yet to settle on an official definition of this, but it involves being comfortably self-assured without being cocky being confident without conforming to gender stereotypes. You don’t have to be gay to have big dyke energy, but you do have to challenge heterocentric norms about womanhood.Big dyke energy may sound like a throwaway internet joke, but trying to conceptualise what it means is a worthwhile exercise, because it gets you thinking about existing female tropes. There is the cool girl the crazy ex-girlfriend the old maid the Stepford wife the gold-digger the femme fatale the scorned woman the cougar the damsel in distress the ingenue and so on. When you start looking at how we categorise women, it quickly becomes apparent that most of these tropes revolve around men.What is great about the idea of big dyke energy is that it reflects a growing acceptance of women deriving their energy not from men’s approval, but from themselves.The political climate offers plenty of reasons to lie awake in a panic. But here is a new one: owls. I have always thought owls look evil, but I had never interrogated their malevolence. That changed when I watched a Netflix true-crime show called The Staircase and started reading about the murder trial it documents. You see, there is a theory that the woman who dies in The Staircase is the victim of an angry owl. While that may sound nonsensical, owl attacks are not uncommon. Indeed, last week, Iain Lee, a TalkRadio presenter, said he was viciously attacked by an owl. I don’t want that to prey on your mind, but please be careful out there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/628810d8f8f6271d2647831bdf1b42c6d8d73db4/0_154_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cace4f0d745a17ac6af2e4f59dc6ed47","title":"homophobia lgbt cure conversation","story":"The ‘conversion therapy’ crackdown is a cynical move. The roots of hate lie so much deeperAbsolutely right. But banning conversion therapy is confusing cause and effect: it is simply the most extreme and obvious effect of homophobia. It’s also an easy win, like banning the use of kittens as footballs. The abhorrent practice that has to go is homophobia. But “Minister recognises insidious nature of prejudice and attempts to unpick centuries of ingrained hate” makes a less snappy headline.Buried within this long-overdue survey is a more startling, and depressing, figure: more than two-thirds of respondents said they had avoided holding hands in public with a same-sex partner. Startling, because it’s only two-thirds depressing, because it just is.I’d love to know where the other third lives so I can move there. And I live in Brighton. Every queer person performs survival maths every time they step out of the house. The formula is beaten into you. Here it is: count the people around you, then multiply risk based on the number of straight menfootball shirtsdrunks, then consider how fast you can run. Then hold hands. Or not.Certain days and times are more dangerous than others – it was a Saturday night when a gang of teenagers chased me right to my front door, which they then tried to kick in. But it was barely Antiques Roadshow time on the Sunday evening my husband was punched in the head so hard he was thrown across a parked car.Denying yourself a small, everyday act of love every single day adds up to a lifetime of harm. It’s death by a thousand cuts that blames the victim for seeking attention or making a statement. Endlessly doing the “Will we be safe?” calculation steals energy - like a computer whirring slowly because of some hidden virus. The conversion therapist is in your head.Theresa May has said that nobody “should ever to have to hide who they are”. This is the same woman who voted against equalising the age of consent who voted against allowing LGBT couples to adopt and whose first act as home secretary, in 2010, was to make sure public bodies did not have to actively try to reduce inequality. Yes, she’s since approved civil partnerships and equal marriage. And yes, she’s laying out the vol-au-vents for another rainbow reception at Downing Street. But she seems to specialise in creating hostile environments then bemoaning the results.Banning conversion therapy is the showy top line of Mordaunt’s 75-point LGBT action plan. It’s a welcome step in the right direction. But only £4.5m has been allocated to the whole thing. This is classic pink-washing. Look at this terrible thing we’re banning! Be grateful! Don’t look at what we’re doing or not doing for LGBT people every single day. I’m sick of feeling grateful. We must be as watchful of our politicians as we are of those beery bigots cheering in the street. They’re just as dangerous.A real action plan would tackle homophobia at the root, in health and education. It would make PrEP HIV drugs available to everyone today – one pill a day, proved to save lives and money by dramatically reducing HIV infection. The Scottish government has rolled it out nationwide Theresa May refuses to.Amanda Spielman, the chief inspector of schools in England, said some faith schools run by religious conservatives were “deliberately resisting” British values and equalities law. If May’s faith truly is the personal matter she insists it is, she’ll have no problem immediately secularising all state schools. Every pupil should be safe in a system that prioritises the rational over the supernatural, and love over hate.But any such plan is impossible for as long as this government is propped up by the DUP, the only party in Northern Ireland against equal marriage for all.Holding hands is a small act. It’s not essential. In an ideal world, you wouldn’t think twice about it or notice it. You’re not really going to get killed for doing it.

On the naked, athletic body, a six-pack can look as sharp as a Tom Ford suit or a Vivienne Westwood gown. But, when you think about it, there aren’t many people who make a daily appearance in their best outfit. Our best is usually reserved for special occasions, and our masterpiece is only displayed in peak condition.A washboard tummy requires a delicate balance of nutrition and exercise technique, so anyone who maintains a glowing six-pack must admit to keeping a vigilant regime. They don’t train hard only to eat carelessly. (A baggy top will conceal a guilty meal. I should know. I have several!) So the short answer is: you already have one. Stop covering it with fatty food choices, and you’ll see it.But as a personal trainer, I want to know why a flat, ripped tummy is such a frequent request. I’ve been asked by a broad spectrum of gym-goers over the years (mostly women), aged from 18 to almost 80, but not one of them could say why this particular goal is so important – much less why it has become, for them, one of life’s battles.Google returns almost 600m results to the question “What is the ideal body shape?”. And many of those results, rather than address the anxiety behind the enquiry, attempt to answer the question. The problem is, in doing so, we fitness advisers perpetuate this mass insecurity.Such an inquiry reveals a desperate lack of self-acceptance that should surely be addressed rather than indulged. The human body is highly engineered for optimal function. It is not an ornament. There is no perfect weight. If the pursuit of a healthy-shaped body could be promoted as an internal goal rather than an external one, we might see that our aesthetic rewards are a natural occurrence of a healthy, balanced lifestyle and perhaps, this way, we can encourage a healthier mindset for young people to aspire to.I get my professional kicks when I see advancement in the people I help, but my perks are usually related to movement or improved hormonal activity, which is what ultimately leads to fat loss and muscle gain. Excess fat is stored in the body as a waste product, whereas muscle protein keeps our metabolism highly efficient and helps our bodies to function better. From this perspective, it’s easier to see that physical fitness should be the primary pursuit and that the aesthetics are simply an indication that we’re living the right way – a healthy way.For those people still determined to obtain that cut figure of a Love Island contestant – it is possible. It’s just hard work. If you have addressed your diet and started an exercise regime, belly fat can be the last stubborn hurdle, and shifting it can seem unattainable. It isn’t.Crunches and sit-ups will do a great job of toning the rectus abdominus: that’s the washboard stomach muscle we can often see airbrushed on magazine covers. To obtain those ripples, we first need to be mindful that we don’t “top up” belly fat with our dietary choices. Most of us know how to do that – who worries about the fat content of an apple? The body cannot self-generate fat and store it in unsightly places we just need to avoid putting it in to our system. Once we’ve addressed that, we can then target the waistline with some static exercises that hone in on the transverse abdominus (TA).The TA is a hidden wonder. It’s a large, deep sheet of core muscle that provides a solid foundation for the surrounding heavier muscles, including the obliques (aka love handles), the rectus abdominus (washboard) and our lower-to-mid back muscles. Once we strengthen the TA, it becomes a magnetic anchor for the surrounding muscles. Training the waist from the inside out zips you up.The TA is the type of muscle that responds better to isometric (static) stimulation, so a good exercise for targeting your TA is the plank. In the full plank position, a person is suspended by four narrow points of the skeletal frame, the elbows and no more than four toes (though I guess the forearms and fists are chipping in a bit too). The only thing preventing the middle section of the body from caving in is that deep sheet of muscle resisting gravity and holding everything in place.It must be remembered though, a six-pack serves no practical purpose, has never been a hero, brought peace, inspired true happiness, or provided love and comfort in times of need. These are all virtues that we possess, and which can’t be improved by fitness training. A well-toned six-pack does have a power of attraction. But unless you’re a swimsuit model looking for an agent, drawing attention to your buff waist might not be something that’s missing from your life.• Emma Oko is the founder of OKOactive.

Which is why I can only welcome a change in tone from some senior members of the party in recent weeks. Theresa May condemned anti-Muslim prejudice in the House of Commons. The Conservative party chairman, Brandon Lewis, wrote that it was “utterly unacceptable that anyone should suffer abuse because of their faith”, and at a recent event to celebrate Eid, the communities secretary, James Brokenshire, was clear about the need to tackle Islamophobia. I welcome this language, but it’s not enough.Nearly three years since I raised these issues with the then chairman, a year after submitting a six-page dossier to the party and nearly a year after I wrote to the prime minister, we now have a string of voices adding to the chorus of concern. The Muslim Council of Britain has called for an inquiry the Times published a leader urging the party to “set Muslim minds at rest” and Lord Sheikh warned that bigotry was a “matter of grave concern”, the Muslim Women’s Network UK, British Muslims for Secular Democracy and others have supported calls for an inquiry and yet absolutely nothing tangible has happened.Words without action are at best flannel and at worst represent simple contempt. So it’s time for my party to set out its stall. Not only does justice need to be done, it needs to be seen to be done. Lewis, as a fellow lawyer, should instinctively know this.There should be a forensic, wide-ranging and transparent inquiry into Islamophobia in the party. The process should be published, those who are found wanting should be publicly named and membership withdrawn. And it needs to be cathartic, allowing witnesses to come forward and tell their stories.Sadly there is no shortage of stories: Bob Blackman’s sharing of a tweet by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson, or his membership of anti-Muslim Facebook groups the Conservative councillor who shared an article calling Muslims “parasites” the local council candidate who advocated repatriation. And the blatantly, deliberately Islamophobic mayoral campaign against Sadiq Khan in London. Party members have been calling radio phone-ins to speak about their experiences, but are too afraid to give their names others have confided in me but daren’t speak up in public as doing so would “finish them politically”. These include the dedicated volunteers who we convinced the party had changed. If we don’t fix our latest bigotry blindspot, they will abandon us – and a coming generation will not see the party as a space for them.Some are determined to proclaim there is “nothing to see here”. Sajid Javid is right to say that having Britain’s first Muslim home secretary is something we can all be proud of. But to argue that this means there isn’t prejudice in the party is bizarre – as bizarre as suggesting that with a female prime minister in office we’ve resolved sexism in politics.Zac Goldsmith’s 2016 campaign for London mayor was made possible precisely because the party didn’t care about Muslims and ignored their concerns. That attitude led me to ask the 1922 committee of backbench MPs at one meeting if they could assure me we would move on from the era of “Fuck the Muslims”. I think I got my point across.The current plan to tackle Islamophobia, however, is woefully inept. Lewis has oddly announced that he will work closely with the hate-crime reporting service Tell Mama. While I believe the issue within the party is serious, no one is suggesting that Conservative members are committing “hate crimes”. Systemic prejudice is far more subtle. It passes the dinner table test but will rarely reach the level at which the police can prosecute.The party needs to be proactive and change its culture. The availability of non-mandatory ersity training is not enough. Those who are most likely to offend will not be inclined to take part. The training should be compulsory for at least those about whom concerns have been raised. I’d suggest Goldsmith and Blackman receive preferential enrolment.Hiding behind bureaucracy and using process as a fig leaf is not the answer. This is a lesson Labour learned in its row over antisemitism. That fiasco holds some lessons for us Conservatives. We rightly and swiftly called Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters out. I hope and believe we did so from a genuine position of abhorrence at the comments and actions of some Labour members. But the longer we fail to address Islamophobia in our own backyard, the more likely our concerns on antisemitism are to appear politically motivated.For years I have argued that an internal inquiry was the solution to this mess. Unfortunately the time for that has now long passed. As a plethora of people and organisations have said, only with a full, independent inquiry can we truly become the party we claim to be: one that deplores prejudice in all its forms and stamps it out wherever and whenever it rears its ugly head.• Sayeeda Warsi is the former co-chairman of the Conservative party"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f10f48ef8380e2b5371adcbf9956c3a2a98d193/49_0_1475_885/master/1475.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eb00e654a54923786b1bcdb9c79e13d","title":"does the moon hold the key to the earths energy needs","story":"Tidal power is the only renewable source derived from the moon. Now an extraordinary array of devices promise to unlock this vital energy potentialUsing giant kites, blades and paddles, and mimicking pogo sticks, blowholes and even the human heart, groups around the world are on the cusp of harnessing the colossal power of the oceans.The challenge is huge - seas have been battering coasts and sweeping sailors to their doom for millennia - but so is the prize: huge amounts of clean, reliable and renewable electricity for an energy-hungry world. Taking on the challenge of operating in this savage, corrosive environment is not for the faint-hearted, and the costs remain worryingly high, as demonstrated by the government’s rejection on Monday of a £1.3bn tidal project at Swansea. “There is no doubt – shit happens during marine renewable energy projects,” says François Renelier at Bessé, a French insurance broker.But the ocean energy sector is frothing with ideas, with hundreds of companies developing an extraordinary array of devices and backed by billions of dollars of investment. Among the serious contenders tapping rapid tidal flows are 12 metre-wide underwater kites that soar and swoop.“We fly with the tides,” says Martin Eklund, at Minesto, which is installing a £25m array off Anglesey, north Wales. “The main advantage is we can harvest energy from very low currents. This resource is abundant – it is everywhere.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@the“We will need every kind of renewables we can get out hands on, including marine, to move us around, heat our homes and so on,” says Declan Meally, at the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.Many nations, from Ireland to India to Korea, are now making moves and tidal and wave energy capacity doubled in 2017, albeit from a very small base. China has invested $200m since 2010 in ocean energy, and the EU €3bn in combined public and private money in the last decade.Tidal energy is most advanced. Bladed turbines are being deployed, which harness fast tidal flows in the same way wind turbines catch the wind. The world’s first large-scale tidal array, the Meygen project built by Atlantis Resources in Orkney, is now sending power to the grid. But, unlike the wind industry which has settled on a three-blade design, underwater designers are also testing four and six-bladed versions too.OpenHydro, already deployed in Canada’s Bay of Fundy, use giant 16m hoops with inward-pointing blades that resemble the mouth of a giant lamprey fish. Its makers opened the world’s first tidal turbine manufacturing plant in Cherbourg last week. There are also vertical turbines that spin like a fairground carousel, such as Hydroquest in France and LHD in China, and one company is even making an undulating membrane inspired by swimming fish.Capturing wave power is even more challenging than tapping the tides – “survivability” is the key term in this sector. “The cost of building something to withstand these extremes is the only thing that has held it back so far,” says Tom Denniss of Wave Swell in Australia. His company’s device works like a blowhole, with waves blasting air up a tube and out through a turbine.He compares developing wave technology to his own record-breaking feat of endurance running: “I ran 622 marathons in 622 days and it was a lot easier than developing marine energy technology - at least it took less time.” Other wave devices, such as Wedge Global, use buoys that bounce up and down on a pole, like a pogo stick, then duck underwater when storms rolls in. Another, Corpower, uses a hydraulic system inspired by the human heart to dampen the impact of the worst weather. “That has been the big challenge for wave energy – how to turn it on and off in big storms,” says chief executive, Patrik Möller.Paddles are being deployed too, such as Waveroller, which uses long seafloor flaps that are washed back and forth by swells. Another, Wave Piston, uses paddles strung along a 185m pipe to push pressurised water through a generator.The Wave Piston’s biggest challenge to date was a big industrial trawler ramming into the system, despite the deployment having been cleared with the marine authorities. “We have had a lot of adventures, some good, some bad,” says Martin von Bülow, at the company.One technology that is not being widely pursued is tidal lagoon power. Here, large, expensive walls are constructed to trap seawater at high tide, which is released through turbines at low tide. But those constructed so far, such as in France and Korea, took advantage of sea walls being built for other purposes such providing a transport link.Which technologies make it into mass production remains to be seen, but the sector is backed at the highest levels, from Europe to China to Canada. “Clean renewable energy from the sea ticks all the right boxes,” says Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. “It is a groundbreaking industry with plenty of potential for new jobs and economic value, and in a world facing the devastating spectre of climate change, it also helps us supply homegrown energy while drastically cutting our greenhouse gas emissions,” he said at the International Conference on Ocean Energy in Cherbourg, France, last week.The way Denmark captured the wind turbine manufacturing market by moving early is inspiring many of the leading nations. “Everyone is trying to be the next Denmark, but for another technology,” says Bruce Cameron, the former director of renewable energy in Nova Scotia, which hosts the bay with the biggest tidal range in the world.However a major obstacle to ocean energy commercialisation has loomed into view: the stunning drop in cost of offshore wind power in the last year, as huge farms are rolled out. “While offshore wind in Europe has clearly come of age, ocean energy is still learning how to take the first steps,” says EU environment commissioner, Karmenu Vella.This has led some governments, such as the UK, directing their subsidy support to marine windfarms. This has left wave and tidal energy developers stranded between successful testing and the full-scale production that would then start driving costs down. “They call it the valley of death - we’re there,” says Marcelle Askew, at Swedish wave energy firm Seabased.However, some nations are still offering support: Canada has a feed-in-tariff and France, despite concerns at the finance ministry over costs, is expected to offer a major tender within months.Ocean energy supporters say it is essential in addition to offshore wind to drive progress towards a zero-carbon world. Tidal energy in particular has the advantage of being precisely predictable, years ahead. “As long as the moon circles around the Earth, you will always have tidal energy. But you can have no wind for days and days,” says Laurent Schneider-Maunoury, CEO of Naval Energies, the makers of OpenHydro.His company is also exploring another ocean energy technology which provides power 247, by exploiting the temperature difference between surface and deep waters to generate electricity. Like other ocean energy technologies, this may well already be competitive with the expensive diesel generators used in many small or isolated communities. Cost is not the only challenge to be overcome, such as ensuring coastal communities themselves benefit from projects and ensuring marine life is not endangered, though dolphins, seals and fish all appear to avoid the devices deployed so far.The big question remains undecided: will ocean energy will provide a major new wave of renewables in the years to come? Some have doubts, like Prof AbuBakr Bahaj, at Southampton University in the UK, and who has analysed the sector for 25 years. “I’m not really sure,” he says.Others, like Drew Blaxland, from developers Atlantis, says with many technologies now proven to work, it is simply time to scale up production and drive down the costs. His message is blunt: “Wake the hell up, grab it by the nuts and get on with it.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

No, not Ms Campbell, but the\u0026nbsp“Naomi” skirt. It’s a knee-length leopard print number by the Australian brand Réalisation Par, which is, without doubt, winning Instagram this summer. Heralded as “the most popular skirt on social media” and “the most viral clothing piece of the year” by fashion blogs, it has been modelled in selfies by influencers from Stockholm to Los\u0026nbspAngeles.Leopard print is the beast of pattern, its history loaded with symbolism, from power to seduction. Over the years, its fans have ranged from Bet Lynch to Rihanna, Alexa Chung to Theresa May, the Queen, Jayne Mansfield and Pat Butcher. It comes with its own soapbox, and yet manages to allow wearers to make their own statements.In the 1960s, leopard fur went through a phase of popularity. Jackie Kennedy wore an Oleg Cassini coat in 1962. Demand rocketed and the leopard population suffered. In the 1970s, the print proved popular with glam rockers from Marc Bolan to David Bowie. “It was a way for people to play with androgyny, it was a rebellion,” says Weldon. The 1980s saw it become part of punk and what Weldon calls the “MTV style” of pop stars such as Madonna. The 1990s had Azzedine Alaïa’s iconic 1991 autumnwinter collection, indie faux fur on Garbage’s Shirley Manson and Scary Spice’s jumpsuits.Ultimately, Weldon believes leopard print remains popular because “it has accumulated meanings … Someone can wear it and feel as if they are standing out or blending in, they can feel outrageous or casual. They can feel like it makes them look more mature, they can feel like it makes them feel more youthful.” The shape-shifting properties of leopard print give it many more than nine lives this year it is not just a summer fling, but a long-term investment.

For the past six months, I’ve been shooting in America, and it seems increasingly clear we’re now living in a dystopian reality TV show. America has always had a tendency towards the operatic but, fuelled by the hand grenade of insanity that is Donald Trump, it’s reached new heights of hysteria. This means even the smallest developments are heralded as either the end of the world or the second coming.It’s terrifying. It is also thrilling. We are appalled by what we witness unfolding each day – essentially, the destruction of the American way of life by its own administration – but we’re also inescapably gripped by it. This is a very exciting time in our history.Certainly, we have to embrace such an apocalyptic time, because the alternative is hand-wringing inertia, and that’s perfect for those in power. Whenever there’s any kind of enormous global shakeup, there’s bound to be paranoia and insanity, but out of earthquakes come opportunities. Even Trump’s fierce arrogance and distaste for his fellow man is good. It’s revealed how many people and politicians share such a view, and our exposure to such hypocrisy is healthy.We need to be pushed out of our comfort zones – of complacency, and, for most of us in the west, an easeful life. I’m not advocating physical pain, but I do believe mental pain can be a way to stimulate and reset the brain.What’s needed is art: good, challenging art, not good-taste art, which is the chief enemy of creativity. Problem is, most of our culture comes to us via a small number of conglomerates whose sole purpose is the bottom line. Our entertainment industry is trivial and banal: glitz, glamour and an illusion of perfection and enjoyment that’s very far from the truth. Cinema has become like Chinese food: it gives you cheap, instant pleasure, like an orgasm, but it’s not very healthy or interesting.The future must be different. I want it to be an uncontrolled place of beautiful chaos, where everyone can create their own universe and is free to speak their own mind, without being overseen by big business. A place of free speech and free access.Over recent years, I’ve bought and had restored scores of old movies as a hobby. I wondered what to do with them. Then I realised I should share them for free, so I set up a website where they could be streamed. There’s no catch you’re not being sold anything. Take it or leave it.Why these particularly movies? I knew director Curtis Harrington, who passed away in 2007, so Night Tide was a very personal choice for me. Curtis had been so disappointed with his career, and yet he had made what I consider to be one of the most important films of the pre-counterculture movement. And the film was rapidly disintegrating because of the condition of the negative. I had to rescue it. It reminds me of a Hans Christian Andersen fairytale: it’s almost naively adolescent in its expression of falling in love, being obsessed with something delicate and fragile.Bert Williams’ The Nest of the Cuckoo Birds proves a movie can be the impossible, lonely burden of just one person. Bert’s name appears in the credits more than even mine is in my films – and I admire such obsession and megalomania. Maybe, like Bert, you only need to make one movie in your life. Bert – an artist who created the outrageous poster for the film – decided to paint on film instead of a canvas. Cuckoo Birds is a strange, singular example of an unidentifiable genre, because it’s a bit of everything: horror, sex, melodrama. Ron Ormond’s The Burning Hell is a fantastic marriage of extreme propaganda and lowest-common-denominator pandering. It’s so aggressive in selling you the Bible, it’s practically an attack on your senses. Yes, it’s laughable, maybe even terrible, but this only serves to make it more unique. It’s almost an installation art piece. And some might consider the star of the show, Reverend Estus Pirkle, to be a bit of a Trump precursor. Dale Berry’s Hot Thrills and Warm Chills is a prime example for the argument that art doesn’t have to contain a single drop of good taste. My fetish for Berry is so great that I not only bought all of his films, I bought all of his clothes – a collection of Nudie western suits. Low-budget regional cinema fascinates me. These were movies made by people who had no ideas of what a film was supposed to be, and feel more as if they were made for the people at the bar on the corner or the cafeteria down the street than for Americans at large. I hope my site will inspire people to see the world a different way. Setting it up has helped me reconcile myself to a different concept of culture than the traditional, romantic one I was raised with. People of my generation – I’m 47 – want tangible tokens of mortality to cling to. But nostalgia is artistic suicide. You have to accept the fact that everything disintegrates in your hands.Donald Trump was elected on the promise he’d make America great again. Older voters rushed at the chance to return to a comforting fairytale. But they are not the same people who will inherit the US and have to heal its isions. And the past was rarely this scary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd891be41c7fe7da793092722e1d9de6aaa11339/0_174_3423_2054/master/3423.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41f4dfbab64a7de832466323be267281","title":"colombia england world cup last 16 match report","story":"Finally, at 11.52pm local time, the last kick of an epic night. Eric Dier, England’s fifth penalty-taker was setting off on his victory run, soon to be submerged by his teammates. Gareth Southgate had forgotten, yet again, he was supposed to be nursing a dislocated shoulder and here was the hard proof that England, contrary to the impression they might have given for much of the previous 30 years, did know how to win a penalty shootout, after all.It was a euphoric and nerve-shredding finale and these are the moments, surely, when England’s followers could be forgiven for daring to dream that something special is building, something exhilarating and rare. Yes, it would be dangerous to get too carried away but right here, right now, to hell with anyone who insists it is time for restraint. England have arrived in the quarter-finals and the World Cup is suddenly filled with all sorts of new possibilities.This was their first knockout victory in a World Cup for 12 years. It was only their seventh, in any major tournament, since 1966, and now they face Sweden on Saturday for the right to play Russia or Croatia in the semi-finals.Southgate had told us he wanted England’s penalty-takers to “own the process” and they did just that, eventually. It was a close-run thing but Jordan Henderson’s miss – or, rather, David Ospina’s save – mattered little in the end because of Mateus Uribe hitting the crossbar with Colombia’s fourth effort and Jordan Pickford saving the next one from Carlos Bacca, ensuring Moscow 2018, will be remembered much more happily than Turin 1990, Saint-Etienne 1998, and Gelsenkirchen 2006, and not forgetting the European Championships at Wembley 1996 Lisbon 2004 and Kiev 2012.An hour after the match, England’s supporters were still partying at one end of the stadium. They did not want to leave and who could blame them when, after three penalties each, England were one down and staring at another harrowing story of deja vu?Dier joined Harry Kane, Marcus Rashford and Kieran Trippier in showing why all that practising of penalties on the training ground was necessary. Kane had also scored from 12 yards to give England the lead shortly before the hour and it was not until the third minute of stoppage time that Colombia prolonged the match by concocting the equalising goal. Another team might have wilted after such an agonisingly late equaliser. That, however, was one of the more impressive parts of England’s performance. Dier might have won the match with a free header in the second period of extra time. Danny Rose, another of England’s substitutes, had a golden chance and in the extra 30 minutes there was hardly a single moment when it felt as though Southgate’s players might go under.This was only England’s second shootout victory in eight attempts at major tournaments, the other coming against Spain in Euro 96, and in the process they answered so many questions about their nerve and temperament for the big occasion. Ever since he took the job Southgate has been asked whether his team could cope when the heat of the battle was dangerously close to intolerable. We know now that, yes, they do. Yet the shootout was only part of the story against tough, obdurate opponents – “animals” according to Chris Waddle in his radio commentary – on a night when Colombia’s supporters had filled this stadium in swathes of bright yellow, bouncing and swaying like human blancmange and creating a raucous din.They bellowed the words of their national anthem – Oh gloria inmarcesible – and outnumbered their English counterparts in a way that is rarely seen. Yet just consider, for example, Kane’s competitive courage when he had his first penalty and Colombia’s players, to put it bluntly, lost the plot about the decision to penalise Carlos Sánchez for grappling him to the floor at a corner. The protests were so chaotic Kane’s penalty was delayed by almost four minutes. What nerve the captain showed to improve his position at the top of the Golden Boot scoring chart – his sixth goal and his third penalty.Colombia might have been missing the injured James Rodríguez but they still occupied a superior rung of the football ladder to Tunisia or Panama or the scratch Belgium XI who England encountered in the group stages. But Southgate’s team were never cowed. The manager had instructed them to play with freedom, to show adventure, to hold out their chests and demonstrate they knew how to take care of a football, too. True, they found it difficult to get behind the Colombia defence and looked more dangerous from set pieces rather than open play. Yet their opponents barely troubled Pickford throughout 90 minutes and that in itself felt like an achievement against a side featuring Radamel Falcao, Juan Cuadrado and Juan Quintero.The evening might have been a lot more straightforward if the correct decision was made, towards the end of the first half, when Wilmar Barrios took exception to Jordan Henderson’s proximity to the defensive wall and dealt out his retribution by lifting his head into his opponent’s jaw. Henderson ended on the floor and Barrios was so lucky to escape with only a yellow card he could be seen shaking the hands of the match officials at half-time.The uproar before Kane’s penalty was shocking in other ways but Southgate had told his players not to react to the provocation and, in that respect, the game against Panama was a valuable lesson.Colombia still had more than half an hour in normal play, plus five minutes of added time, to concoct an equaliser. They spent most of that time arguing with the referee, feigning injuries and trying to pick fights. But then, in the 93rd minute the substitute Uribe let fly with a 30-yard volley. Pickford’s flying save was exceptional but it was Yerry Mina against Harry Maguire at the resultant corner: Colombia’s tallest player against England’s. The man in yellow won the header, the ball bounced off the turf and Trippier did not have the height to stop it on the line.Would it be the same old story for England? It felt that way after Falcao, Cuadrado and Luis Muriel scored Colombia’s first three penalties of the shootout. Instead, Pickford had a heroic role in the victory. Dier’s penalty was not entirely convincing but Ospina was face down, distraught, and the victory run was under way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f0177340188904b85253104ffa32f1c246090fa/190_215_3619_2171/master/3619.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=623515f41468b50eb593c041ad78d799","title":"france kylian mbappe closer summit argentina","story":"Forward’s brilliant performance in the last 16 showed he has learned off the best, like Neymar and Antoine GriezmannFootball is a hard drug that offers immediate satisfaction and indignation viewed through its prism, Kylian Mbappé can be idolised and Lionel Messi sacrificed in the same game. Reason has nothing to do with it: the drug attacks your emotions – and at the cost of the footballers.Mbappé cost €150m before he was worth that. As there is more money than talent on the market, promise and expectation get bought at the price of reality. The price turned the media spotlight on this prodigious child and so a ceremony of confusion began. Football is a very serious game but it is full of people doing all they can to make idiots of footballers.Mbappé, in this year of adaptation to his price and the expectations placed upon him, played well and played OK (he doesn’t know how to play badly). He also saw team-mates of the level of Edinson Cavani and Neymar from up close. A fine education, if you know how to see it, how to look for the right lessons. He had the privilege of being able to imitate essential characteristics: the generous endeavour of Cavani, a striker who covers the entire pitch Neymar’s magic, conjured up through speed, skill and fantasy. He also ran the risk of imitating other characteristics, ‘learning’ the wrong thing: the Uruguayan’s jealousy towards the Brazilian (remember the penalty crisis?) Neymar’s excessive, sometimes irritating desire to put on a show.And all that he learned at an important club, one of those clubs that help you triumph but don’t forgive you if you do not. In other words: under intense pressure. If a player so young can come out of that cocktail of experiences alive, he is a phenomenon, not just once but twice: for his talent and for his maturity.When Mbappé arrived at the World Cup he was still under observation, an object of expectation. In the first few games neither he nor France appeared comfortable. The midfielders could not generate fluidity in the play and the three forwards distributed the space badly. They won, but did not convince. But the knockout phase came against Messi’s Argentina and Mbappé definitively demonstrated that his talent was as high as the expectations. It was one of those games in which a player walks on to the pitch as someone and, thanks to his enormous talent, walks off again as someone else. Football is an emotional, mind-altering drug, bending perception.Mbappé chose the day that Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo left the World Cup to start his revolution. Without asking permission, without the need to knock discreetly at the door, he burst into footballing history, flattening everything before him. From the first minute, he appeared to be made of wind and steel, taking flight and destroying the Argentinian defence.The conditions were perfect. Argentina tried to keep the ball to control the game but could barely touch France. When your team becomes so rhetorical with the ball, you end up wanting them to lose it sooner rather than later, because if they lose it later, when the opponents are positioned deep, waiting, then the same scene recurs.In the Argentina-France game, we saw it as Mbappé running towards goal, three Argentinians chasing behind him. If they didn’t catch him: goal. If they did catch him: penalty. Argentina were poor but Mbappé was colossal, demonstrating a precision at speed that we hadn’t seen since Ronaldo, the fun, talented Brazilian who when he set off was like an entire herd stampeding.The leap in quality and prestige that Mbappé made against Argentina takes him closer to football’s summit. What remains to be seen is how well, how naturally, he can live up there. His talent appears greater than the dangers that await him. His kingdom requires space and the ball, but he will not always encounter those as easily as he did against Argentina. The risk is that in this football, which celebrates impact, like never before, placing imagery above all else, he satisfies himself with producing plays rather than playing – and they are not the same thing.He has Antoine Griezmann alongside him, from whom he can learn to play while he waits for the move to appear. He can learn collective sense, to help teammates, to be committed tactically, to request the ball to feet as well as in space. When you’re fully connected to the team, integrated with the idea, the move appears without having to go looking for it. The rest will come naturally, a product of an exceptional talent which over the next decade will help us overcome the nostalgia that Messi’s and Ronaldo’s inevitable decline will provoke in us.Mbappé stepped into another dimension against Argentina and as football is full of paradox, something happened to his price too: the same day he proved he was worth what they paid for him, his price doubled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbf57c9902b2e7771039a0e8c701fdae10e8a731/0_171_4105_2463/master/4105.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f11d68dc887fa370dfbad43dbd80a38c","title":"gareth southgate jordan pickford england hero world cup penalties win","story":"Gareth Southgate has heaped praise on Jordan Pickford after the England goalkeeper emerged from a difficult week to inspire the team’s penalty shootout win over Colombia.The Everton No 1 became the first England goalkeeper since David Seaman, against Argentina in Saint-Etienne in 1998, to save a spot-kick in a shootout at a major tournament as the national team forced their way into the quarter-finals. Pickford’s display against Belgium in the final group game had provoked some criticism, while his opposite number, Thibaut Courtois, had suggested he was too short.Southgate, whose team face Sweden in Samara on Saturday, first pinpointed the fingertip save Pickford had mustered in stoppage time at the end of 90 minutes as an indication of the 24-year-old’s qualities, before the goalkeeper made a profound mark in the shoot-out. “It was a top-class save, and I was surprised he could reach it given his height,” said the manager through a smile. “His athleticism around the goal is excellent and he executed the plan in the penalty shootout.“We’d studied all their takers, and great credit should go to the collective of staff, and to Jordan, for taking on board that information and preparing in the right way. You don’t always get what you deserve in life but I think we did against Colombia.Southgate had seen his side ship an equaliser deep into stoppage time but remained calm as he encouraged his players to focus ahead of the extra period. “At 90 minutes, the message was that we were in total control,” he explained. “We’d suffered a huge set-back, but we had to stay calm. They hadn’t created many chances and we had to keep belief in the way we were playing.“At the end of the game, I needed to give them their inidual time. But there was no use shouting or getting them overhyped. We were in control of the process. It was ours to own. I had trust in their techniques. Great credit to them that they executed it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/684f84182d74592f9e85c6afd786d98e683fd5ed/0_321_4853_2914/master/4853.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d32cee148bb095e73357871c1e7f374","title":"its coming home england erupts into celebration after win over colombia","story":"Traffic brought to a standstill in London by jubilant fans dancing in the street and singing Three LionsEngland fans have declared the World Cup knockout curse over after the Three Lions’ dramatic penalty shootout win over Colombia, with spontaneous celebrations and unfettered joy breaking out across the country.Eric Dier slotted home the winning spot kick to confirm England’s place in the last eight of the tournament, sending the relatively few England fans in the stadium and nearby bars into raptures.The national side’s first World Cup shootout win – at the fourth time of asking – along with a quarter-final draw against Sweden, had many supporters believing “football’s coming home”.In London, traffic on Shoreditch High Street was brought to a standstill as jubilant groups of fans broke out into song, belting out the resurrected anthem Three Lions and dancing in the street, pints held aloft.Similar scenes played out across the capital, and the nation.Congratulations poured in for the team from all quarters.

Nothing.” And also the poignant message “So that’s what it feels like”.Alastair and Gillian Robertson, who moved to Moscow from Sevenoaks, in Kent, for work 18 months ago, spoke of their delight.Alastair Robertson, 44, said: “If England can win at penalties for the first time in I don’t know how many years – 50 years of hurt, we win on penalties then we can go all the way.“And the next round Sweden, all respect to Sweden it’s going to be a great game but I think our boys will step up.”Barney Corkhill, 26, who lives in Peckham, south-east London, agreed.He said: “At full time I was telling people around me, ‘Yes we are going to win on penalties’ - I didn’t believe it.“I actually predicted we would get knocked out to Colombia in the last 16 so I was already worried.Brendan Collins, 30, described the match as an “emotional rollercoaster”.“We won and to win on penalties was probably a massive boost to the ego,” Mr Collins, who is originally from Manchester but has lived in Stavropol for 18 months and Russia on and off for five years, said.“When it went to penalties, we had a lot of people around us like, ‘hmmm’.“But it’s broken the curse now, it’s coming home.“I think given the penalties have broken the curse, we’re going all the way - 2-1 in the final against France.”Jay Kumar, 55, from Northolt, west London, and his friend Johnny Rai, 59, from Hayes, west London, had to settle for watching the game in a bar packed with Colombia fans near the Spartak Stadium.Inside the arena, the lowest number of England fans since the Tunisia game - officially numbering 2,225 - were drowned out by their rivals until after the game, when the players went over to take selfies and share the special moment with them.England are now joint second favourites alongside France to win the tournament at just 41, according to bookmakers Ladbrokes.Press Association contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e58a24621b08bb987e834fcaceaa3ab546d6c9c/0_122_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc7d876f809677ff27313a4107634c57","title":"swedish media reaction england sweden quarterfinal world cup russia","story":"•Swedes accuse Gareth Southgate side of ‘usual hubris’•England’s ‘mistakes will be punished by Janne’s gang’Sweden have qualified for their first World Cup quarter-final since 1994 and the country’s media reacted to the news that they would face England in the last eight with confidence and anticipation. The Scandinavians believe Janne Andersson’s team have nothing to fear in Samara on Saturday.“Bring on England,” wrote Peter Wennmann, who is covering England for Swedish paper Sportbladet. “Sometimes you just have to pinch yourself, wipe the sweat from your brow and sigh: ‘What bloody drama!’. So now we have Harry Potter against Pippi Longstocking. Now it is all about dreams and fairy tales that have to be told.”Most Swedish newspapers are hoping England will underestimate Sweden, with Expressen’s Daniel Kristoffersson saying Gareth Southgate’s young side will be hit by their “usual hubris”. He wrote: “Sweden have reached a sensational quarter-final after an enormous feat. Now England, who have their usual hubris, awaits. It is a completely different team to what we are used to - and that suits Sweden perfectly.“England’s wing-backs can get to offensive and with their new passing game there is the risk that they are vulnerable on the counter-attack. Just like Mexico against Sweden, England cannot afford to make any mistakes. Then they will be punished by Janne’s gang, who have delivered their past two games in what is almost tactical perfection. Add to that the fact that the pressure will be enormous on England. They will carry the nation’s hope on their shoulders.”Olof Lundh of Fotbollskanalen and TV4, says he “could not understand the English arrogance before the game. Why?” He added: “Can we start to dream about a medal? Yes, a little but don’t say anything to Andersson because he doesn’t dream, he works. And that has worked well so far.”Håkan Mild, the former Sweden international who was part of the team that finished third in 1994 and now works as a pundit for Swedish Radio P4, said that Andersson’s side has an excellent chance of reaching the semis. “England have just played a long, tough game with extra time and I also think they have hubris. They think they are going to win and they will get an unpleasant surprise on Saturday.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffc1a83312bdf459625c910836f9301422628f4e/0_0_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?w=465\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=553f8f8175d470c5ced96384dbbc618a 465w","title":"englands penalty heroics sweden march on and quarter finals to savour world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss England’s first ever penalty shootout win at a World Cup, Sweden progressing, a Mrs Granqvist update, Paul Konchesky and which of our panellists dealt with tonight’s football the best"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65ec9cff2e1314d64bc98a040cef2a47f579c7c1/285_156_3040_1824/master/3040.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d74d358af48442b71606f3819deb4db5","title":"world cup 2018 the latest news and reaction after england progress live","story":"World Cup fever may be swamping England, but one fierce man in his 50s is already looking forward to the future and Qatar 2022 (I know, crazy). And Joachim Löw, the Germany head coach, only signed a meaty contract extension in May:Away from England, to ... the player of the tournament so far? Mbappé chose the day that Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo left the World Cup to start his revolution. Without asking permission, without the need to knock discreetly at the door, he burst into footballing history, flattening everything before him. From the first minute, he appeared to be made of wind and steel, taking flight and destroying the Argentinian defenceThe bookies’ favourites for the World Cup? Brazil, widely, around 3-1, followed by France and then ... just look who it is, England, ahead of Belgium and Croatia. And, by the time Gareth Southgate’s side play Sweden on Saturday, two of France, Uruguay, Brazil or Belgium will have been sent packing. Amazing, eh?Amid the euphoria, there is some jarring concern over England’s inability to slice open defences for fun. “I agree with Ben Lake (10.19), England have not created much from open play,” emails Lee Taylor. “This might get us through against Sweden, but I don’t think we will prosper if we play Croatia.” He “seems to have forgotten our other open play goal – Kane’s glorious deflection,” says Matthew on Twitter. Are we worried? Does it matter? Do join the debate.... to this:There’s a national lesson there that goes beyond football, one all about possibility and shaking off the curse of fatalism. We should take it to heart and savour this moment. For who knows what lies in store when Saturday comesComing home? Well, the former England midfielder Scott Parker has returned to former club Fulham as first-team coach, where he will work alongside head coach Slavisa Jokanovic. He joined Tottenham Hotspur’s Academy last summer to coach their Under-18s. “I’m looking forward to getting started right away in preparation for the Premier League campaign,” Parker says.Jordan Pickford, the Everton No 1, became the first England goalkeeper since David Seaman, against Argentina in Saint-Etienne in 1998, to save a spot-kick in a shootout at a major tournament as the national team forced their way into the last eight: We’d studied all their takers, and great credit should go to the collective of staff, and to Jordan, for taking on board that information and preparing in the right way. You don’t always get what you deserve in life but I think we did against Colombia.Cutting from the Swedish newspaper, Sportbladet:Ah. From Moscow, courtesy of correspondent Shaun Walker:Last night passed off without any major fan trouble, but there was one minor incident. Russian fans and media were enraged after it emerged that an England fan had apparently defaced a statue honouring Spartak legend Fedor Cherenkov outside the stadium. Cherenkov was a midfielder who played for Spartak Moscow for more than a decade. Photographs showed “ENGLAND” scrawled onto the statue in what appeared to be orange marker. The graffiti was swiftly scrubbed off, but not before angry Russian fans had called on the fan to be found and deported.Stadium security and police detained the fan responsible, named by Russian news outlets as Rufus Hall, though there was no official confirmation of this. The Russian newspaper Sport Express posted a contrite video apology from an English fan, apparently Hall, on Twitter: “I feel sorry, I feel embarrassed, I love this country for the two days I’ve been here. Your people have been welcoming, I’ve had a lovely time. I would never disrespect the country, I respect the history. Had I known this would offend people I would never have done it and I wholly apologise”.It is unclear whether Hall was fined, or whether police plan any further action over the incident. If you aren’t allowed to get carried away now, when can you? “I’ve been thinking about how to mark England’s now-inevitable World Cup triumph,” tweets an excitable David Nicholas. “Gareth Southgate grew up in Crawley, near Gatwick Airport, which I’ve always thought was an ugly name. How about Southgate International? ‘Southgate’ even sounds like an airport terminal.”And, a dose of reality, to bring us thudding back to earth, courtesy of Ben Lake. “I can’t get over the nagging doubt that we seem incapable of creating anything out of open,” he says. “We have scored one goal that is not a set-piece or penalty and that was very much a worldie, not something to be relied upon. Especially not following Lingard’s slightly out of sorts performance last night.”They were decent England penalties last night, weren’t they? Harry Kane set the tone to match Falcao’s effort, and kudos to Marcus Rashford to ripple the net as he did. Kieran Trippier did not bow to the pressure and, ironically, Eric Dier’s, the one that clinched it was arguably the worst of the lot – not that it matters.Gareth Southgate, a man of the people. Brilliant picture:England news: Jamie Vardy made the desired impact in Moscow he looked razor-sharp after coming on for Raheem Sterling two minutes from time, carving out a half-chance and his explosive pace a problem for Colombia. But, the reason the likes of Kieran Trippier and Eric Dier took penalties before him, has since become clearer, with the striker appearing to pick up a groin injury a few minutes into extra-time. A couple of reports suggest Vardy is already a doubt for the Sweden match in Samara on Saturday.Away from reality, there is a world of rumour:Be honest, how many times have you played Vindaloo or Three Lions this morning? World in Motion on loop? Also, anyone else find themselves humming along to Atomic Kitten’s 2001 hit Whole Again every now and then? “Southgate you’re the one, you still turn me on ... ” It’s amazing what a football match can do.Things are looking pretty good for Harry Kane, on all levels:He says his penalty miss at Euro 96 will always live him, but, at this rate, so will this group of players, with Gareth Southgate praising his young squad for not reverting to type nor conforming to the struggle synonymous with England teams of yesteryear:Colombia’s best player was sat in the stands last night, and in tears at full-time, but man-mountain Yerry Mina looked ruddy good in defence no wonder Barcelona, where the 23-year-old – believe it or not – is still finding his feet, have set his buy-out clause at €100m. A 6ft 5in colossus, Mina dominated, even while struggling with a groin injury late on. He surely has a huge future.How about a winner stays on, a poker night or a round robin competition of sorts to determine the best (and most ludicrous) England celebrations last night? I raise you Ross Kemp:Standout players last night? Away from the obvious candidates – Jordan Pickford and Harry Kane – thought Harry Maguire was brilliant again, and John Stones too. Maguire pleading for Mark Geiger, the referee, to consult VAR when Jordan Henderson was ambushed by Wilmar Barrios was pretty convincing too, incessantly moving his index fingers in the shape of a TV monitor. As for Kane, he really has relished his role in this England team, leading from the front. Also, no one’s talking about those momentum-losing wholesale changes for the Belgium game anymore, are they? In fact, Sai, perhaps a little prematurely, emails: “Belgium lost the World Cup by beating England in the group stage.”How about that, then? A night when a country emphatically leapt out of the knockout stage doldrums, an evening in Moscow whereby a curse was broken, and, simply, a penalty shootout was won. Won. By England. In the end, despite Yerry Mina’s almighty best efforts to dampen the feel-good train, Gareth Southgate’s side did it in perhaps the best manner possible, crushing all those old demons, those previous tepid and cruel exits. Going forward, that set of penalties will surely stand them in good stead, even with all of the favourable-side-of-the-draw talk. It is a night that will live long in the memory.And with that I’ll leave you in the Pickford-like safe hands of Ben Fisher, who’ll steer you through the reaction as a nation awakes and realises it wasn’t all just a glorious dream. England won a World Cup penalty shootout, it’s true, and are now just three wins from being crowned world champions. Oh just stop it. Goodbye.We have a solution to the problem of players surrounding referees! Or rather Jonathan Holland does. “In an audio version of VAR,” he writes, “players should only be allowed to email or tweet their opinions to the referee. A panel would then consider the merits of each opinion. It has its flaws I admit, but it could work.” Flaws? None. And it’s not difficult to imagine certain players getting on board straight away. Before I hand over the reins to euphoria hangover central in London, good on Martin Gamage for this: “Having emailed in after the Belgium game to berate Pickford for his performance, I guess I should have my humble pie,” he writes. “Thought he was much better last night: solid handling, decent distribution, a good save and, of course, the shootout. At least I didn’t suggest he was too short. Let’s hope he maintains his form I can see the Sweden game going to penalties too.”Meanwhile, Quentin Seik writes: “Jordan Pickford is 6ft 1” (185cm) all this talk about him being a little guy is madness surely?! For context that is the same height as Iker Casillas \u0026amp Sepp Maier, and only 4cm shorter than Lev Yashin. They were all pretty good.”What of the vanquished Swiss? Their coach, Vladimir Petkovic, had been keen to raise the profile of his team this tournament but they fell at the last-16 stage without much fanfare. “Maybe we reached our limits,” Valon Behrami said. “I have the feeling that we are not ready for the really important games, or not good enough.” “The final cross and the final pass were missing,” the former Arsenal defender Johan Djourou said. “Sweden were not the better team, but we didn’t have the little bit extra in attack, and when you don’t have that extra, it becomes difficult.” A nice little story from Reuters here:Sweden fan Ragit Shaqiri found it difficult to celebrate his side’s progression to a first World Cup quarter-final since 1994 with a victory over Switzerland on Tuesday, as his cousin Xherden Shaqiri played for the losing team. The Swedes won 1-0 thanks to winger Emil Forsberg’s deflected strike, causing mixed emotions for the 18-year-old who grew up on the same Rosengard estate as retired Sweden legend Zlatan Ibahimovic.“I watched the game in Kosovo with all my relatives, it was very exciting but at the same time very stressful,” Ragit told Reuters as Sweden set up a last-eight clash against England on Saturday. “I was happy and sad at the same time when Forsberg scored, I thought Xherdan played very well, his crosses towards goal were very dangerous,” he added.Xherdan’s father and Ragit’s mother are siblings, and left the poverty and conflict in Kosovo for Switzerland, with the latter then opting to settle in the Swedish city of Malmo. A promising amateur footballer, Ragit’s agent is Xherdan’s brother Erdin and he now hopes Sweden can go on to even greater things. “In the World Cup nothing is guaranteed, but I hope Sweden go on to win it,” he said.We heard from Sweden coach Janne Andersson, but how are his players feeling about the prospect of facing England for a place in the semis? Needless to say, they’re confident. Why wouldn’t they be?“Bring them on,” said striker Marcus Berg. “Most of them have respect for us and we feel secure regardless of who we meet.”Last night’s goalscorer Emil Forsberg said: “We have had nightmare opponents wherever we went, and no matter who we get they’ll have to work hard to win. We believe in what we’re doing and believe we can do something great, and that we can achieve something fantastic.” And midfielder Gustav Svensson said: “I don’t think their players want to meet us. We have shown time and again that we are a team that no-one wants to meet, a team that allows very few goal chances. If you ask their players, I don’t think any of them will want to meet us.”Graeme Fleming emails in. “Why do Fifa not take opportunity to introduce that only the captain can speak to referee and anybody else will be sent off? Time to stop this shocking behaviour.” It’s a seemingly sane proposal, and one which offers the amusing prospect of players surrounding their captain, demanding he delivers their views to the ref. Stop press: the US have won the World Cup. In Quidditch.Is Jordan Pickford too short to be a world class keeper? That was the suggestion of Thibaut Courtois after his Belgium teammate Adnan Januzaj curled an unstoppable effort past England’s No 1 in the group stage game. Gareth Southgate was quick to heap praise on Pickford after he produced one of, if not the, save of the tournament against Colombia, before his shootout heroics in Moscow. Top eight short keepers (in no particular order), according to the Blizzard:And you could maybe add Fabian Barthez (1.80m) to that list. No one’s getting carried away. Not at all. djkbrown2001 writes: “Greece won euro 2004. This could be England’s year. And Harry Kane becomes Sir Harry Kane. Definitely would have to be knighted if England wins it.”“Morning Mike.” Hi Matt Loten. “After a fairly sleepless night during which Three Lions was ringing around my head until 2am, I am researching the penalties through bleary eyes over my morning coffee. Name on the trophy and all that. I actually thought the referee had a good game. He made it clear from the get-go that if Colombia were going to be physical he would punish them. Assuming that the yellow for the headbutt was the VAR’s call, he was right on all the big decisions, and he wasn’t intimidated by when the Colombians tried to intimidate him as the game wore on. I’m sure the Colombians will disagree, but that’s academic anyway, as it was always coming home.” I share your certainty that Colombians won’t agree, but yes, the referee did well to notionally keep a lid on things in what was a fairly intimidating atmosphere. Did he get Lingard’s penalty shout right though?Without wanting to tempt fate, (Sir) Gareth Southgate really does seem like a decent chap. He talks in a considered, honest manner that is mightily refreshing for a man in his position and his head, for now, appears to be firmly screwed on. Of course it helps he’s enjoying some success and he could yet end up depicted as a root vegetable on the front page of a tabloid, but for now, it’s something of a love-in. “For the belief of this group of players, and groups of players to come, it was a really important moment. Not just winning the shootout but having to suffer at the end of the game in a stadium that was five to one Colombian fans and felt like an away fixture. To come through all of that – we’ve spoken to the players about writing their own stories. Tonight they showed they don’t have to conform to what’s gone before. They have created their own history, and I don’t want to go home yet.”Given the euphoria, you’d think England had already won the whole shebang. They haven’t, and with Sweden next up, they’ll do well to further their interest beyond Saturday. The Swedes have now accounted for Switzerland (ranked sixth in the world by Fifa, for what that’s worth) and Germany in Russia, to go with the prized scalps of the Netherlands in qualifying and Italy in the playoff. That’s quite the hit list. And all without Zlatan. Or quite possibly, because Zlatan’s not about. Not that coach Janne Andersson wants to talk about you-know-who. “I’m not going to talk about how things were before. We talk about now and this squad. It’s just full steam ahead and, God dammit, we are going to put in a bloody good match. We are not satisfied with this. We want to win the next match.”Sachin Nakrani spent the night in a Colombian bar in London’s Elephant and Castle to sample the atmosphere. Needless to say, it was a rollercoaster. “By 5.50pm it was standing-room only inside and, while a smattering of the 350-strong crowd were England supporters, the majority had come to cheer on Colombia, any sense of ided loyalties among a group of people who can trace their lives in London back to the first wave of Colombian immigrants that arrived to the United Kingdom in the early 1980s left at the door.“Pre-kick-off excitement quickly gave way to nervousness given England’s early domination. It was not going how the crowd here wanted and, sensing that, the in-house DJ called for chanting: “Co-lombia! Co-lombia!” The call was met but halfheartedly so and it was not until Juan Quintero’s shot just before half-time that those in attendance rediscovered their excitement.”So, shootout joyheartbreak aside, what of the actual game itself? For the large part, it was a turgid, niggly affair punctuated by far too many stoppages. It was one of those frustrating games to watch that never really found its flow until Colombia were forced to chase an equaliser. And you have to feel for the referee, who tried his best to keep a lid on things, but in doing so was forced to blow his whistle far too often. He had no choice really. Still, he’ll surely cop some flak from Colombia in the coming weeks.Who was man-of-the-match in Moscow? Which England player only merited 5 out of 10? Marcus Christensen runs the rule over both sets of players:Over to Barney Ronay, with a tribute to man-of-the-moment, Jordan Pickford:“Not all heroes wear capes. Not all people capable of flying through the air, arms outstretched to produce a moment of mind-bending, match-turning athleticism wear capes. But Pickford was both of these things in Moscow.Jordan Henderson set the platform and Eric Dier delivered the decisive blow, but you’ve got to give Gareth Southgate some credit for ending England’s penalty hoodoo at World Cups – it’s an issue close to his heart and he clearly doesn’t want to see any of his current players go through what he did post-Euro-96. Southgate said his miss against Germany will stick with him forever, but his decision to employ the psychologist Pippa Grange and prepare the players for the eventuality of penalties has paid idends. As he said last night, future generations now have the belief it can be done. And the impact of that cannot be underestimated. Here it is: Henderson knows he’s dodged a bullet.Of all the great photos of a memorable night, this is a corker for the story it tells in a single moment. There’s another image, from television, of the England team’s celebrations at the moment Dier’s penalty hit the back of the net – everyone hares off to jump on the scorer and Pickford, with the notable exception of Jordan Henderson, who simply sinks to his knees, apparently overcome by sheer relief. I’ll try to dig that one out.“Hand of Jord”, “Spot luck”, “Spot on”... just some of the UK papers headlines to help ease sore heads upon waking. Here’s the rest of them:It’s difficult to judge from afar, and Sydney is the definition of far from England, but I’d hazard a guess there were wild celebrations following the shootout win in Moscow. There is photo evidence:Max and the team try to come to terms with England’s shootout win in today’s podcast, while they also look at the Sweden-Switzerland game – one low on incident, but high on ballooned shots and fizzers going out for throw-ins – and give an update on Mrs Granqvist.And there we have it. The quarter-final lineup is complete and, after yet another night of drama – if not entirely high-level football – England joined Sweden as the final names to fill out in the last-eight bracket of our wallcharts.Sweden’s 1-0 win over Switzerland – courtesy of Emil Forsberg’s deflected strike midway through the second half – is unlikely to be too fondly remembered in the World Cup annals but over in Moscow, it was a slightly different story. Well, at least for long-suffering England fans.For a largely spiteful 120 minutes of a pretty ugly spectacle filled with more stoppages, playacting, ing, recriminations and remonstrations than you can shake an angry fist at, the game went entirely to script. Colombia’s injury-time equaliser was almost preordained. Then, just as England’s inglorious penalty past appeared set to repeat once more, the narrative veered into uncharted territory. This is, after all, Gareth’s New England. Jordan Pickford and Eric Dier did their stuff and England, it turns out, are indeed capable of winning a penalty shootout at a World Cup.What it means, of course, is that football is still on its way home. Woot. It’s just a bit late, and not exactly walking in a straight line – more weaving about like a drunken fan after five pints and a kebab. But it will get there in the end. Won’t it?The answer to that (or not) and much more to come over the coming hours on a day that has no live football (eek). I’ll be here for the next few hours to pick through the reaction to both the above games, plus any other World Cup-related news if and when it breaks. And, course, we’ll endeavour to continue our rolling coverage of Neymar. It’ll be interesting to see if he’s still going.Throughout the course of the dayeveningwhatever it is where you are, please do feel free to get in touch on email (mike.hytner@the) or Twitter (@mike_hytner) or below the line.

People should also all be doing tai chi, weight lifting or ballroom dancing – although carrying home heavy shopping bags might do the trick.Aerobic exercise, such as walking or gardening, is good for the heart and improves the circulation. PHE’s review said that muscle and bone strengthening and balance activities are also vital for health and future wellbeing, but they are neglected. “People’s understanding of walking more and doing aerobic activity, keeping up the heart rate, has grown, but the need for us all to do two sessions of strength and balance exercise a week has been the Cinderella of public health advice,” said Louise Ansari from the Centre for Ageing Better, a charity set up with lottery funding a few years ago which jointly commissioned the expert review with PHE.In 2011, the UK’s four chief medical officers issued guidance containing three pieces of exercise and activity advice, but only some of it has been well followed. Walking has become increasingly popular. But fewer people have taken on board the need to stand more and sit less and muscle strengthening and balance have been largely forgotten. Muscles tend to be at their peak in our 30s, said Ansari, and the muscle tone is going by the time we reach 40 unless we actively work on it. The best forms of exercise, according to the review of evidence, are ball games, racket sports, dance, Nordic walking and resistance training – usually training with weights, but including body weight exercises which can be performed anywhere.These exercise both arms and legs, strengthening muscles and helping us keep our balance. In Nordic walking, for instance, two poles are used. Ansari said the type of exercise required depends on a person’s fitness.. “If you are a reasonably fit adult and you do walking, you should also do yoga or tai chi or racket sports or resistance training which could be in a structured exercise class. You can do two long sessions a week.“I do an hour and a quarter of tai chi every week. That helps with my balance. I should also do something like badminton and circuit or resistance training.”But exercise doesn’t have to be in a gym, she added. “You can also make sure you go up and down stairs a lot instead of taking the lift. That is resistance training. Your body is providing the resistance. You don’t have to go to the gym. As long as you are feeling the ache in your muscles.”Dance of all sorts is good for muscles and balance, from folk to salsa to ballroom. “If you don’t feel you can go to a full-on dance class because you are a bit frail, standing on one leg for 30 seconds a day or tai chi are very good.”Ansari said she doesn’t use a gym. “I don’t go and lift weights, but I make sure I’m carrying shopping home and carrying things around – consciously lifting weight.”The advice is not just for the elderly. “Alongside aerobic exercise such as brisk walking, all adults should be aiming to do strengthening and balancing activities twice per week,” said Dr Alison Tedstone, head of diet, obesity and physical activity at PHE. “On average we’re all living longer and this mixture of physical activities will help us stay well in our youth and remain independent as we age.”The evidence review now goes to the four chief medical officers, who will update the guidance next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/769c0ddcab385ca72b7512efed41146615628c25/0_119_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9505709ae7b78a43fcbe4d833f296d7e","title":"six of the best fourth of july pies","story":"Six celebratory slices to serve on party day across the pondFor the crust200g Oreo cookies80g salted peanuts2 tbsp butter, meltedFor the filling 195g cream cheese, at room temperature105g icing sugar190g peanut butter, room temperature, sugarsalt-free if possible 100g milk chocolate175g whipping creamFor the topping50g milk chocolate50g salted peanutsTo make the pastry, heat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4.

Other highlights range from summer-camp drama The A List, to Teen Taxi – a sort of Gogglebox meets Car Share real-life series that “will shine a humorous and engaging light on the conversations had between teenagers and their parents as they travel in their family cars”. Also on offer is a “junior Panorama”-style documentary series covering subjects such as teenagers emerging from foster care, boys becoming men, and life in eco-communities. CBBC doctors Chris and Xand van Tulleken will front special programmes on mental health and alcohol. Taylor said the YouTubers were chosen because they were already role models who influence children, but both she and BBC Children’s head of discovery, Stuart Rowson, said they hoped the BBC would grow its own influencers of the future. It is vital for the BBC’s future to bridge the gap for teenagers to stop them deserting the corporation as they are the licence fee payers of the future. Tony Hall, the director general, recently said that with the rise in power of US tech giants such as Facebook, Amazon and Netflix, the BBC had “a fight on our hands … a fight for the future of not just the BBC, but public service broadcasting in Britain”.Hall said the corporation risked being overtaken by competitors after finding that 16- to 24-year-olds spent more time with Netflix in a week than with all of BBC TV including the BBC iPlayer. Rowson said: “We need to react to the way young audiences are consuming content. This will give them bespoke content they can access on iPlayer, which has traditionally been a catchup service but is now working to become a video-on-demand service that we hope teenagers will go to as their default destination.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d4ab370bdba0b27b44ce70292b9997b7fdeda29/0_144_2340_1404/master/2340.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a2ccc3567a730fc336f85863ed61837","title":"philip hammond comes clean on brexit","story":"Chancellor wants the world to know that no one can point the finger at him if it all goes belly upIt’s hard not to feel a little bit sorry for Philip Hammond. He has a prime minister who would have sacked him if last year’s general election had worked out as she had planned. Then there are the cabinet colleagues who cannot stand the sight of him, either because they think he’s some kind of soggy Remoaner who is deliberately trying to thwart the “One True Punishment Brexit” or because they suspect he’s starving their departments of cash. Or both.To make things worse, he’s been lumbered with a Treasury team of Liz Truss, Mel Stride and Robert Jenrick that doesn’t even qualify as B list. Barely even capable of managing an Instagram account, let alone the economy. So Hammond is a man alone. The closest you are a likely to find to intelligent life in the current government. Not that the bar is very high.There was a brief moment back in March when the chancellor tried to pretend he didn’t care. If the party wanted him to be Tigger, then Tigger he would be. He would reframe austerity as a period of unparalleled growth, low-paid part-time work as full-time employment and Brexit as the springboard for the UK to become the world’s leading player. That window has long since closed. He just couldn’t maintain the act. In his heart, he was a natural Eeyore. Someone who understood there was no bad situation that couldn’t get worse. He was Lurch the Undertaker.At Treasury questions, Hammond was almost demob happy, secure in his inner miserabilism. As every other minister seemingly now felt free to pursue their own agendas, then he could, too. No need to sugar coat the news. He could just tell it like it was. And it was going to be bad. Very bad.How much of the extra £20bn per year for the NHS was going to be funded by the prime minister’s “Brexit idend”, asked Liberal Democrat Tom Brake. A half-smile crossed Hammond’s lips. He shrugged. To be completely honest he really didn’t have a clue. But his best guess was almost none, partly because we would still be paying into the EU budget for the next couple of years but mainly because all the Treasury forecasts pointed to Brexit costing the country £20bn per year. So it was going to cost everyone more in tax.The shadow chancellor is an unlikely champion of global capitalism but he is also not a man to look a gift horse in the mouth. So when almost every business organisation has taken to issuing panicky warnings about the state of the Brexit negotiations, John McDonnell couldn’t resist reading them out. The charge sheet against the government ran to several pages, but the Undertaker couldn’t have been more grateful. This was music to his ears.Yes, he was well aware of the cost of a no-deal Brexit and the likely loss of jobs, the Undertaker said. But he couldn’t say anything on the current state of the negotiations because no one really had a clue what was going on. The prime minister herself could not even remember if she had come up with a third customs solution that the EU had rejected and, if she had, she certainly hadn’t told anyone else. It was her little secret. One that she was even keeping from herself.But he would be happy to keep everyone in the loop after the Chequers sleepover. Providing he got out of the place alive. The way that was shaping up, there were no guarantees of anything. It could be a bloodbath in which everyone died and nothing was decided. Come to think of it, that was the most likely outcome. But if and when he could, he would. Not least to cover his own back. If Brexit all went belly up and the UK crashed out with a bad deal, he wanted to make sure no one would be pointing the finger at him.It was a surreal moment. One that even silenced the Brexiters in the chamber who wisely chose not to ask a single question. Because they would get answered. Ministers usually regard departmental questions as a potential minefield, one through which they have to tread carefully to say as little as possible. Instead, Hammond had come clean. Loud and proud."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcaaefe7f6ca98a7ea498a47f38d32252f1e310e/25_349_4070_2443/master/4070.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d666b27c6ecc0a5a55983bd29b81b37e","title":"brexit greatest negative impact regions outside london","story":"Price rises will disproportionately affect people in Northern Ireland, Wales, the Midlands and the north-east, reports sayBrexit will make people outside London worse off, two reports have found.Household bills will rise by between £245 and £1,961 a year after Brexit, with a disproportionately adverse impact on lower-income groups and people in Northern Ireland, Wales, the Midlands and the north-east, they say.The Institute for Public Policy Research found a hard Brexit would hit those out of London the most because household spending patterns involved more goods and services that will be hit by price rises.“Our findings suggest that post-Brexit price rises will squeeze incomes more in parts of the UK outside London,” said Marley Morris, IPPR senior research fellow.Wales and the north-east were most at risk because of their disproportionate reliance on producing goods and food for export to the EU including Welsh lamb, Airbus wings, and cars.Flintshire, Wrexham, Sunderland, Telford, Wrekin, south Derbyshire, the home of Rolls-Royce, west Derbyshire and Luton were also identified as potential losers. “All income groups, including the poorest, will face negative impacts,” said the IPPR.A second report by consultancy Oliver Wyman reached similar conclusions. It modelled post-Brexit costs on a basket of 150 imports and found that prices would rise for all consumers regardless of income or where they lived. But in poorer areas the impact of increased costs in goods that attract higher tariffs such as meat and dairy products would be greatest because a greater proportion of household income would go on weekly shopping bills and transport, for example. It calculated that almost £1,000 a year would be added to household spending under the worst-case scenario of a hard Brexit, which it said would cause significant red tape and have World Trade Organization tariffs and increased labour costs. It assessed the supply chain costs for all 150 goods, analysing everything from tariffs to non-tariff barriers such as transport, rules of origin certificates, pre-shipment inspections, delays and administration. It also looked at the cost of labour in each region. The price of a restaurant meal would go up because of increased cost of imported food and labour because of trade and non-trade barriers in every Brexit scenario, it said. While some items may be cheaper on paper such as Argentinian beef or New Zealand butter, the overall impact on the cost of the weekly shopping would be marginal. A soft Brexit would cost households an extra £245 a year, a typical meal for four would go up by £9 and the cost of a price of trainers would rise by about £7.Oliver Wyman concluded Northern Ireland, which has the poorest economy of the 12 regions of the UK, would be hit worst by increased costs.Reaching the same conclusion as the IPPR, Oliver Wyman found that the savings in importing goods from non-EU countries did not outweigh the increased costs of EU imports under every Brexit scenario.“Even if we had free-trade deals with every single country outside the EU and went to no tariffs, there is no way things will be cheaper. It is still a negative situation for everybody,” said Duncan Brewer, partner at Oliver Wyman and head of its retail and consumer team. It found the post-Brexit picture was complex but that if certain households spent a greater share of their income on goods expected to cost more because of trade barriers, they were more likely to be exposed to price changes. “Given that the EU will continue to negotiate trade deals with third countries, it is hard to see how the UK could significantly outpace the EU in negotiating agreements that lower consumer prices,” it said.The Oliver Wyman report illustrated the point with the cost of Irish beef, commonly sold in supermarkets. It wholesales at about £3.70 a kilogram. Argentinian beef, which is currently £5.50 per kilo because of EU protectionist tariffs, would come down to £3.50 a kilo after Brexit. At the same time, Irish beef would go up to £3.90 per kilo if tariffs were imposed. But as Brewer pointed out, such a free trade agreement on Argentinian beef would only result in a 20p per kilo saving on beef – not enough to compensate for the higher cost of imports of other goods such as dairy, cars parts or electronics from the EU.A third report published on Wednesday by local councils found that Brexit was creating a “perfect storm” for rural communities, with unaffordable homes, poor connectivity, skills gaps and health inequalities threatening the future success and prosperity of those areas.“If Britain is to make the most of a successful future outside of the European Union, it’s essential that our future success is not confined to our cities,” said Mark Hawthorne, chairman of the Local Government Association’s people and places board.A majority of business leaders want post-Brexit customs arrangements that avoid the need for new customs processes with the EU, even if they take longer to put in place, a survey of 800 business leaders by the Institute of Directors found. Avoiding customs-related disruptions was IoD members’ number-one priority for the UK’s negotiations on its future economic relationship with the EU. Continued regulatory alignment was another clear priority.

This is the first time that the NAO has ever released private correspondence with a minister and is a reflection of the tensions between McVey and the NAO. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, has suggested that the NAO’s criticisms of Esther McVey are sufficiently serious that she should lose her cabinet job.This is Peter Walker here, taking the helm temporarily while Andrew is elsewhere.As we approach Friday’s Chequers summit the pressure from all sides is building on Theresa May. Latest to have her say is the Brexiter backbench MP Andrea Jenkyns, who has used an interview with ConservativeHome to as good as threaten that the PM will be ousted if she seeks a Norway-style Brexit solution.Jenkyns said there had been regular meetings and phone calls during the week between “frustrated” backbenchers. An overly-soft Brexit would be “catastrophic for the Conservative party”, she added.Asked if May could stay in her job in the event of a Norway-type deal, Jenkyns seemed to say not:This isn’t a threat, it’s just as history shows, prime ministers keep their jobs if they keep their promises.The open letter from the National Audit Office to Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, amounts to a remarkable rebuke. The NAO regularly publishes reports highlighting problems with government policy, but those reports are agreed with the relevant departments (meaning criticisms tend to be relatively muted) and it almost never personalises matters (identifying particular ministers for blame).Yet the open letter from Sir Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, accuses McVey of wilfully misleading parliament. This is against the ministerial code and by rights it out to be a sacking offence. (Damian Green lost his job as first secretary of state for less.) McVey will almost certainly be called to the Commons to explain herself, but don’t assume she will definitely have to go. Ultimately the prime minister decides what to do with ministers accused of breaking the ministerial code and, with everything else going on at the moment, a ministerial resignation is probably the last thing May wants.But this is serious. In his letter Morse describes McVey as a repeat offender. He says he is publishing his open letter because, when he wrote to her with concerns about what he was saying about the NAO’s recent report on universal credit, she repeated some of her misleading claims during DWP questions in the Commons on Monday. Morse says McVey misled MPs in three respects.1 - McVey said the NAO report did not take account of the most recent changes to universal credit, when it did. Morse says the report was “fully agreed with senior officials in your department” and that it was “based on the most accurate and up-to-date information from your department”. But McVey said on 15 June that it did not take account of recent changes, and she repeated this claim in the Commons on Monday. Morse says it is “odd” she felt about to say this.While we recognise regrettable early delays to universal credit, my recommendation made clearly on page 11 of the report is that the department must ensure it is ready before it starts to transfer people over from previous benefits.3 - McVey said the NAO said universal credit was working, when it does not accept this interpretation. Morse says:I’m handing over to my colleague Peter Walker now. I will be back after lunch.The head of the National Audit Office (NAO) has taken the highly unusual step of writing to Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey to complain of inaccuracies in her statement to Parliament on the watchdog’s critical report about the roll-out of universal credit (UC), the Press Association reports. The PA story goes on:Auditor General Sir Amyas Morse said it was “odd” that McVey told MPs that the NAO did not take into account recent changes in the administration of UC, when the report had in fact been “fully agreed” with senior officials at the Department for Work and Pensions only days earlier. He said that McVey’s claim that the NAO was concerned that universal credit was rolling out too slowly was “not correct”. Her assurance, in response to the report, that universal credit was working was also “not proven”, said Sir Amyas in his open letter.Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, is giving evidence to the Commons Northern Ireland affairs committee. Andrew Murrison, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, has just asked her about the recent complaints from George Hamilton, the chief constable of Northern Ireland, who said he was “in the dark” about the government’s Brexit plans.Bradley said that there would be “much more certainty” about what the UK is planning when the white paper gets published after the Chequers meeting on Friday.She also said that she would be addressing Hamilton’s specific complaint about how he does not know who is is supposed to liaise with in government over Brexit planning. She said she would ensure that he did have contacts he could speak to.Here is our story about the Electoral Commission concluding that Vote Leave broke election spending rules in the EU referendum.Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave’s chief executive at the time, has given interviews to the BBC and to Sky which have been broadcast this morning responding to the Electoral Commission findings (which have not been formally published yet - Vote Leave is going public on the basis of what it has been told about the commission’s initial findings).On Sky Elliott claimed the commission was getting its information from “marginal characters” and ignoring Vote Leave’s views. He said:And on the BBC Elliott said that Vote Leave was supposed to be working with other groups because it was the designated lead campaign group for leave. He said:I believe we acted both within the letter of the law and also the spirit of the law and the spirit of how you should conduct a campaign. We got the designation, Vote Leave, as the officially designated campaign for Leave, on the basis that we would be working with other groups - we wouldn’t just solely be working on our own, we would work alongside other groups and encourage them, and encourage their activities.The pro-Brexit papers seem to agree that, if Theresa May really does propose a softish Brexit along the lines reported when the cabinet meets at Chequers on Friday, Conservative Brexiters will be appalled.This is from the Daily ’s story (paywall).The plans are expected to see Britain enter into a single market on goods with the EU, collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf and potentially open the door for the European Court of Justice to have a role in arbitrating future trade disputes. A cabinet source told The : “This doesn’t work, it is a fiction designed to keep us in the EU and Single Market. It’s just the Customs Partnership dressed up with another name.”A Whitehall source added: “Eurosceptic cabinet ministers feel like they haven’t been listened to by Downing Street. They are wondering what on Earth all the debate has been about if they are just going to be ignored.”This is from the Daily Mail’s story.Veteran Eurosceptic Bernard Jenkin last night urged Mrs May not to revive the plan, saying: ‘The Government would be playing into the hands of the EU. This deal would deliver Brexit but without any of its freedoms or advantages.’Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, warned the proposal was unacceptable, adding: ‘The third way was one of Tony Blair’s great theories. It was a muddle then and it’s a muddle now.‘The third way is not leaving the EU. What is being proposed, which I hope is not accurate, would be a deeply unsatisfactory non-Brexit.’And this is from the Sun’s story.In a sign of serious trouble for Mrs May, the atmosphere at a meeting of his Eurosceptic Tory backbenchers’ ERG was last night dubbed as “fierce”.The group of 60 Tory MPs demanded a meeting with the Chief Whip, with one saying: “If this is remotely true, the consensus is it will be open rebellion”.In his Today interview Michael Gove was not asked about reports that he ripped up a cabinet paper about the new customs partnership, Theresa May’s favoured customs model, because he felt its conclusions did not fully take account of his objections.But Jolyon Maugham, the barrister who led a legal bid to get the Electoral Commission to reopen its investigation into Vote Leave, was in the studio for an interview and he said the topic came up in the green room afterwards.Here is Maugham’s take on the story.According to ITV’s Robert Peston, Tory Brexiters from the European Research Group have demanded an emergency meeting with the chief whip, Julian Smith, this morning because they are unhappy about the proposals that Theresa May will put to the cabinet on Friday.Good morning. We’re only two days away from the crucial Chequers Brexit cabinet meeting and with reports (the most detailed here) that Theresa May is proposing something that would affectively amount to single market membership for goods and agrifoods, she seems to be facing a backlash already. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, was on the Today programme this morning. He was there to talk about the plans he is publishing for what will happen to fishing after Brexit, but the questioning got more interesting when he was asked about the Chequers summit. In classic passive-aggressive mode, Gove more or less refused to engage with the questions at all, saying at one point it would be discourteous (sadly, he was not asked how courteous he was being when he ripped up a report on Theresa May’s preferred plan), but there was a nugget of news in what he said. He played down the prospect of cabinet resignations, saying “I don’t think so” when asked if he thought Brexiter ministers would walk out over May’s proposals.Gove, who was one of the leaders of the Vote Leave campaign was also asked about the BBC report (which seems to have been based on a pre-emptive, defensive briefing from Vote Leave itself) that the Electoral Commission has concluded it broke campaign spending rules during the EU referendum. Again, Gove was not particularly forthcoming. But he did say he expected the Electoral Commission conclusions to be challenged in the courts. He said:The report itself, I think, is going to be challenged legally. If it’s going to be challenged legally, if it is going to go through the courts, it would be inappropriate for me - not having read the report - to offer a commentary on it.Here is the agenda for the day.9.30am: Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, gives evidence to the Commons Northern Ireland committee.12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.2.15pm: Michael Gove, the environment secretary, gives evidence to the Commons European scrutiny committee.4.20pm: Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, speaks at the Local Government Association conference.I’ll be here until about 10.30am, but then I need to leave for a bit for an appointment, and a colleague will be taking over.

A river meandered below and we sank down to skim across its surface like a dragonfly. A pterosaur swooped in front. The tip of its wing caught the glistening waters’ surface and sent up a spray of water. The audience of scientists gasped as the water hit their surprised faces, droplets spattering their 3D glasses. They held up their hands as a second spray shot out of the seat in front, followed by a hard puff of air as the pterosaur wheeled up into the sky. This was the world of Chinese mammals in the Jurassic era, brought to life in 4D cinema, complete with automated water spray, air jets, and mechanisms in the seat to poke you at co-ordinated moments. No-one could resist the charm as we followed a young Juramaia – a 160m year old fossil mammal from the Tiaojishan Formation – as he navigated a world of Jurassic dangers to find his way home. The serious men and women of science who sat in the auditorium of the Beijing Museum of Natural History (BMNH) experiencing this cinematic novelty, giggled and gasped like schoolchildren. I was lucky enough to be part of a small group of mammal palaeontologists invited to China for a symposium celebrating the opening of an exhibit like no other. The 4D film was part of this landmark event. The BMNH, working together with eight museums and universities across China, have brought together over 50 complete mammal fossils for a world first: an exhibition dedicated solely to the jaw-dropping Mesozoic mammal fossils of China. Most of these specimens have never been seen first-hand by anyone except curators and the research teams who described them. They comprise a role-call of world-changing discoveries, and an opportunity to take stock of China’s leading role in mammal palaeontology. Professor Zhe-Xi Luo from the University of Chicago was one of the key organisers of the exhibition and symposium in Beijing. I asked him how this exhibit came together: “it was not so easy that many local museums would donate their specimens for a common public exhibit. I must credit Dr Meng Qing-Jin, BMNH Director – he personally contacted the owner museums to secure their agreement to share their fossils for public exhibition, and to make them available for international experts to examine.”The cast of the film included all the star specimens of mammal palaeontology. In the last 20 years these fossils from China – complete skeletons laid out like Egyptian hieroglyphics – have revolutionised our understanding of mammals from the Mesozoic, between 251-66m years ago. Few skeletons of mammals from this time were known previously, and so their study was restricted to a fossil record dominated by teeth – the hardest parts of the body and therefore the mostly likely to survive fossilisation. These new specimens are celebrities: their images splashed all over the scientific tabloids: Nature and Science front covers, multipage spreads, the intimate details of their lives poured over by a dedicated palaeontologist-fanbase. From the auditorium we were led downstairs and through a hall of dinosaurs into the exhibition. We flitted like hummingbirds from case to case. In each one the little bones of our ancestors and cousins glinted under the spotlights. Artists’ reconstructions hung above: rich colourful scenes of almost-familiar creatures.  Among the exhibits, Docofossor brachydactylus terrorised its stone slab grave like a tiny Nosferatu. I admired its wide mole-paws. Luo was one of the first to examine this fossil: “I couldn’t believe it when I saw that it was missing one digit segment on each finger. I thought wow, we really have something special here.” Luo led the research describing how these shortened paws - perfect for digging - are caused by genetic changes in these ancient creatures. These are the same mechanisms we see at work in the evolution of later lineages of digging mammals, like moles. It’s the kind of adaptation no-one had imagined happened so early in mammal evolutionary history. And this story is not unique. Every specimen in the room is its own palaeontological revolution. Twenty-three are holotypes, the fossils that define a new species. Their skeletons tell us that mammals were much more than the ‘shrew-like’ animals portrayed in tired old narratives. They weren’t shivering in dark corners waiting for dinosaurs to have their day. Mammal history begins over 200m years ago, and charts the emergence of a dynamic group that grew to a wide range of body sizes, occupied multiple ecological niches, and evolved anatomical specialisations that heightened their senses of touch, smell and hearing. All of this came long before the so-called ‘age of mammals’ had even begun. These animals were no mere rough drafts, they were the complex debut novels of mammal macroevolution.“The Mesozoic mammal exhibition is truly special,” said Dr Simone Hoffman, assistant professor at the New York Institute of Technology who attended the symposium. “There is no other place in the world that preserves such a erse fauna of early mammals and it was great to see this ersity showcased”Earlier in the week we’d been given a chance to have a one-to-one with these specimens. In a square windowless room at the BMNH filled with the aroma of coffee, we sheltered from the punishing heat of the city. Around the large wooden table we each had our own microscope. Under the lens: the most complete fossil mammals the world has ever seen. Prize among them were the haramiyidans. One of the biggest debates in Mesozoic mammal research is whether haramiyidans belong to crown Mammalia – which includes modern mammals – or if they are the survivors of a side-branch of mammaliaforms with more ancient roots. We spent much of the day in debate, cross-examining the evidence in their anatomy.The haramiyidan debate may sound like a meaningless quibble, but it has repercussions for the big picture of mammal evolution. Their remains are among the earliest in the mammaliaform fossil record and include creatures with impressive specialisations for tree-dwelling, gliding, and different diets. Which interpretation you take on their ancestry either places them among our modern mammal relatives, or outside of them. If they are from our crown group, this places our origins all the way back into the Late Triassic, over 200m years ago.Not all the specimens we saw as part of the symposium were at the BMNH. Participants were also transported by bus to the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) on the other side of bustling Beijing. Like the BMNH, IVPP is one of the world’s leading palaeontological research institutions, and a co-sponsor and contributor to the symposium and exhibition.We were led through the air conditioned building and released into a palaeontologists’ playground of mammal fossils. Participants jostled around the first known gliding mammal, Volaticotherium. Its specialised skin membrane, called a patagium, looked like a brushed ink mountain over a jumble of limbs. In life, this patagium stretched between fore and hind limbs to allow Volaticotherium to glide between the trees for foraging or escaping predators, beating modern gliding mammals to this innovation by 70m years. People often assume all mammals in the so-called time of dinosaurs were tiny. Among the fossil treasures, my attention went straight to a character I had long hoped to meet. Curled up like a snoozing dog in front of the fireplace was Repenomamus giganticus: the biggest Mesozoic mammal yet discovered. It lay on a red-brown volcanic tuff bed, tail curled and neck outstretched, deep in geological slumber. This animal was around a metre long and weighed 12-14kg, like a chunky Cretaceous pitbull. It wasn’t only the size that astonished those who first examined it. Inside another Repenomamus specimen, researchers discovered the stomach contents still preserved: its last supper was a feast of bite-sized baby dinosaurs.We left at the end of the week realising that the discoveries from China are just the tip of the iceberg. As they continue to explore the hidden layers of their vast country, there will undoubtedly be many more world-changing fossils to discover. Not only did these mammals take to the trees, burrow into the earth, and e in rich prehistoric waters, but they made dinner of the animals we once assumed were their masters.

Other recent studies have linked improvements in sperm quality to diets rich in polyunsaturated fats such as omega-3, antioxidants including vitamins C and E, selenium and zinc, and folate, all of which are abundant in nuts.“The results of our study could potentially help couples’ chances of conceiving,” said Albert Salas-Huetos, who led the study at the University Rovira and Virgili in Reus, Spain. “But I would not recommend anything based on only one study.”Sperm counts in men have more than halved over the past 40 years, a trend that has led to a raft of scientific investigations into the possible causes. Pollution, bad diets and general poor health have all been suggested as potential contributing factors.Nicholas Macklon, medical director at London Women’s Clinic, said the research was one of a number of trials that could help doctors get to the bottom of what foods might have a genuine impact on sperm quality and potentially fertility.“The changes are notable and likely to be beneficial for fertility,” Macklon said. But he cautioned that the impact might be limited because so many other factors contribute to fertility.As well as improvements in sperm count and shape, the researchers examined the quality of DNA inside the sperm. They found that men in the nut group had sperm with less fragmented DNA. Sperm with highly fragmented DNA has been associated with male infertility.Salas-Huetos presented the work at the annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Barcelona this week. The work, funded by the International Nut and Dried Food Council, has been accepted for publication in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.“The fact that the study has taken place is good,” said Virginia Bolton, a consultant embryologist at Guy’s and St Thomas’s hospital in London, “but we need to see this translated into an effect on fertility.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d7bb79853d99268925a6be7a8d8babb7f059ca8/0_66_5808_3485/master/5808.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c440dc9defd49f5d661172138a677b04","title":"christian horner questions mercedes tactics at austrian grand prix","story":"• Red Bull principal thinks team can still win title• Horner calls Mercedes strategy in Austria ‘bizarre’The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, has described Mercedes’s decision to have their chief strategist, James Vowles, publicly apologise for a strategy error at the Austrian Grand Prix as Vowles throwing himself under the bus to motivate Lewis Hamilton. Speaking before this weekend’s British Grand Prix, Horner was also optimistic Silverstone would remain on the F1 calendar but hopeful that London might still become a venue.Red Bull’s Max Verstappen won in Austria, which Horner believed proved they were still outsiders with a shot at a title, but it was Hamilton’s team that attracted scrutiny. Mercedes opted not to pit the British driver under the virtual safety car, costing him the lead and leaving him angry and frustrated. They took the unusual step of having Vowles admit it was his fault over the radio, saying that he had “thrown away the win”. Mercedes said it had been an attempt to refocus Hamilton on the task at hand.Hamilton has four world championships and is in his 12th season in F1 and Horner could not understand Mercedes’s strategy. “It seems a fairly bizarre thing to need to do,” he said. “For somebody to throw themselves under the bus to motivate a driver to go from fourth back into the lead.”Horner, who has won four drivers’ and constructors’ championships with Red Bull since he became principal in 2005, insisted his team was run differently.“One thing you have to do is win as a team and lose as a team,” he said. “That’s why we hardly talk about iniduals. Because that puts an unfair amount of scrutiny and pressure on that inidual. Our philosophy is that as a team, it is collective responsibility.”Mercedes have been largely dominant for four years. However, they now face a tight fight with Ferrari and Red Bull. Indeed the latter are increasingly competitive and have three wins this season, equalling both their rivals. The competition was proving tricky for Mercedes, believed Horner.“Obviously Mercedes have got so used to being at the front it becomes easy to become complacent,” he said. “And there is an adjustment when that isn’t happening and you are having to fight and having to scrap.“The management of the team have never been in a position where they have had to go head to head for an entire season and the closer you get to the end of the year the more the pressure builds, so it is a new experience for them.”Silverstone is currently contracted to host two more grands prix and is in negotiations with Liberty Media about a new contract, having activated he break clause on their previous deal, unable to meet rising costs. Horner was optimistic that an agreement would be reached, however he also believed Liberty maintained a realistic ambition for London to be a venue.“From a personal point of view Silverstone is the natural home of the British GP,” he said. “But it would be great to complement it with another race even if it was not a permanent fixture, a one-off race in London would be phenomenal. Why not have a race in London one year and one in Paris one year?“Like a European Grand Prix that toured different venues, if the economics worked for Liberty it would be fantastic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d86354271347749ddd4af61ecd3e5300181ae9c/0_105_4398_2639/master/4398.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abab2ad004f3c1cbf043c5c0b2cd79c0","title":"england india twenty20 international match report","story":"Kuldeep Yadav’s left-arm wrist-spin proved an indecipherable code for England’s batsmen as a sea of blue at Old Trafford roared India on to victory in the first of three Twenty20s between these two sides.Indeed the impact of England’s footballers simultaneously taking on Colombia in Moscow was barely felt here. The bulk of the 23,000 to pitch up were cheering for Virat Kohli’s newly arrived tourists, who repaid the cacophonous support by chasing down 160 for a comfortable eight-wicket win and a significant statement of intent.KL Rahul’s unbeaten 101 from 54 balls may have brutally knocked off the target with 10 balls to spare in a blaze of 10 fours and five sixes but there was no question where the difference lay Kuldeep’s earlier figures of five for 24 had reduced a befuddled England to 159 for eight from their 20 overs. Little wonder Kohli is so pleased with the current heatwave.“Kuldeep’s a very good bowler,” said Eoin Morgan, one of three victims in four balls to the left-armer’s predominantly googly-based wizardry. “He’s obviously going to be a big threat. Everything seemed to happen very quickly, which is a credit to the bowling. It’s something we’ll assess before the next game and hopefully play it better.”England’s meagre total, after Morgan had seen a seventh successive toss go against him this home summer, was propped up by the latest masterclass from Jos Buttler – a 46-ball 69 made up of sumptuous pulls and wristy drives – but his was essentially a lone hand.They had started at a decent lick, with Jason Roy’s frenetic 30, but his demise – chopping Umesh Yadav on to the stumps via the pull shot that had met fresh air a couple of times previously – brought Alex Hales to the crease for what proved a torturous 18-ball eight.While Buttler had taken Hardik Pandya for 18 off the 11th over to put England on 95 for one, the inability of Hales to get going was applying drag before he fell to Kuldeep, bowled trying to sweep what would have been his first boundary. With Ben Stokes eyeing Sunday for a return from injury, Hales needs a score in Cardiff on Friday.Kuldeep’s true impact would come in his next over – the innings-changing 14th – when he ripped out the guts with three victims in four balls. Morgan was caught in the deep off a slog sweep and then both Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root were stumped for golden ducks. When MS Dhoni whipped off the bails for the latter, having fumbled initially, it was a record 33rd such dismissal for their former T20 captain.Kohli decided to keep Kuldeep’s final over back but the left-armer returned for the 18th and, with Moeen Ali having already gone for six when slicing Pandya to cover, he wrapped up his maiden five-wicket haul when Kohli held Buttler at long-on. It should have come two balls sooner too, after Rahul had given the Englishman a life.While Chris Jordan was the third man out first ball – caught and bowled by Umesh off his pad – David Willey was in no mood to go down with a whimper, blasting 29 from 15 balls, adding a touch of fight in some verbals with Bhuvneshwar Kumar, and an early breakthrough in the chase when Shikhar Dhawan played on in the first over.Willey should have had a second, too, with Roy putting down Rahul on 17 at backward point. But from there the No 3 took full control, putting on 123 in no time with the more sedate Rohit Sharma to break the back of the chase in a flurry of long-levered blows.Sharma’s departure with 30 runs required gave the partisan crowd a final chance to chant Kohli’s name and, after Rahul completed his second international century in this format, the Indian captain smoked Moeen over long-on to wrap up the one-sided win."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bef9b434e2a83ff522267042ffbef6097f032ed/0_122_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e20a9aab75858cbd38ed00ead2b8cda","title":"tour de france 2018 team by team guide","story":"All eyes will be on the long-running French squad each time the route goes uphill and once the mountains swing into view they’ll blow the race apart or die trying.

With no big sprinter, no specialist climbers and no time-trial victory prospects either the pre-race meetings may well be a sombre affair each day. Three weeks of opportunities then for Luis León Sánchez, Omar Fraile and co to do what they do best, get in a break and be last man standing.

Always a threat if given too much leeway which isn’t often as the other teams know how dangerous that can be.A decisive moment in the development of the Bahrain project as Vincenzo Nibali returns to the Tour with the sole aim of winning a second title. Everything has been done this season to make that a distinct possibility and there’s only a token nod to maybe participating in some of the sprint finishes with Sonny Colbrelli. Confidence is high for Nibali after he confirmed his credentials as one of the greats with a Milan-San Remo win at the start of the season. Watch this space.Tours de France 1 Tour wins 0 Stage victories 0 Green jerseys 0 King of the Mountains 0 Days in yellow 0Tour heritage A largely anonymous debut in 2017 with Janez Brajkovic their best in 45th overall, but things could – should – be very different this year.Team leader Vincenzo Nibali is one of the most exciting and charismatic riders of his generation. If you give him a chance he’ll take it and if you don’t then he’ll make one. Fabulous descender and climber respected by everyone.This is possibly the last try for BMC to conquer the TdF crown a second time and following last year’s disaster for their leader Richie Porte possibly his final chance too. After a slow start to the season the Australian has come into form at just the right time and with his win at the Swiss Tour confidence will be high. They have the firepower to win the team time trial and control any race situation so tactics aren’t a problem. Only playing the GC game and with only one card.Tours de France 8 Tour wins 1 Stage victories 4 Green jerseys 0 King of the Mountains 0 Days in yellow 7Tour heritage Victory for Cadel Evans remains their greatest achievement although they have also managed a brace of fifth places for Tejay van Garderen. Last year, with Porte nursing his injuries, Damiano Caruso was an unobtrustive 11th overall.Team leader Porte lines up as sole leader with all the responsibilities on his shoulders but he’s used to pressure. The reported descending fragility is unfair as it’s not bravery that’s been missing, it’s luck. Could this finally be his year?This is another team with something to prove and after the controversial expulsion of Peter Sagan last year they’ll all be motivated to put the world champion in the best possible position to take a sixth points classification win. Their GC hope, Rafal Majka, will be left to his own devices when the overall fight begins but he’ll be OK with that as surfing the opportunities, like Sagan, is one of his strong points. Proof that the Germans have a sense of humour.Tours de France 3 Tour wins 0 Stage victories 2 Green jerseys 0 King of the Mountains 0 Days in yellow 0Tour heritage Up and down, from worthy wildcards as NetApp-Endura to a major team built around Sagan, who won them a stage last year but was thrown out for dangerous riding. His mate Macej Bodnar’s final time trial win was some compensation.Team leader Sagan is the most charismatic rider in the peloton today. Another green jersey is his goal and usually when he wants something, he gets it. Massive respect from everyone for how he races and entertains, on and off the bike. The Roubaix stage favourite obviously.The biggest of the French wildcard teams always animate the race but the arrival of a new team manager in Cédric Vasseur has changed their approach, with the fiery sprinter Nacer Bouhanni dropped in favour of his former lead-out man Christophe Laporte after the pair fell out earlier this season. They don’t have a proper train for Laporte, so he will have to fend for himself after the kilometre-to-go kite. Prior to that it will be business as usual: get a rider in the break and hope.Tours de France 21 Tour wins 0 Stage victories 10 Green jerseys 0 King of the Mountains 1 Days in yellow 4Tour heritage In the Tour every year since 1997, their 10 stage wins are spread over eight different years. Their most recent came in 2008, since when they have faced an uphill task largely because of Bouhanni’s lack of consistency.Team leader Laporte has a cooler head than Bouhanni and is more of an all-round talent while lacking his erstwhile team leader’s explosive speed that’s earned him a string of wins this year including the rough-road Tro Bro Léon in Brittany.It’s been a dreadful season so far for this squad with crashes, illness and bad luck meaning results have been few and far between. Relying mainly on the sprint prowess of Mark Cavendish, and a setup which serves the Manxman, is normally a guarantee of success but when things go wrong they need riders capable of stepping up to the plate and they too, young and old, have faltered. The team needs at least one stage win to steady the ship but the management hasn’t shown much direction or confidence in Edvald Boasson Hagen, so if he pulls something out the bag it’ll be a surprise.Tours de France 3 Tour wins 0 Stage victories 7 Green jerseys 0 King of the Mountains 0 Days in yellow 1Tour heritage Stage wins in 2015 and 2016 for Steve Cummings, and last year for Boasson-Hagen, plus Cavendish’s stellar 2016 (four stage wins and a day in yellow) give them an enviable record.Team leader Cavendish is still chasing the all time record of Tour stage wins, however the sprinting competition is stronger than ever and his leadout train hasn’t had much practice or, more crucially, form. It could be the return of the Manx missile but he’ll need to take some chances.An interesting mix of young and old that will be looking to take their chances where and when they can. They have some solid riders like Lilian Calmejane, who is a good bet if he makes it into the long range escapes, but their biggest challenge will be getting in one in the first place. A team looking for inspiration now that Tommy Voeckler is on the podium giving out the laurels instead of receiving them but definitely the one most likely to be chasing the overall combativity award.Tours de France 18 Tour wins 0 Stage victories 10 Green jerseys 0 King of the Mountains 2 Days in yellow 23Tour heritage Consistently good Tour performers with regular stage wins, a couple of jerseys and two decent spells in the yellow jersey. But always dependent on Voeckler, who provided most of the results.Team leader Sylvain Chavanel, an oldie but a goodie and likely to wear the No 1 for his team because he comes first alphabetically. Realistically any one of them can be the homme du jour.The surprise rider of the 2017 Tour de France returns with the same setup now dressed in pink instead of their previous lime green. Not in the least embarrassed Rigoberto Urán has been deceptively quiet so far this season but he was last year too. With his form a mystery anything could happen so team manager Jonathan Vaughters, himself a bit of a maverick, may well be relying on Sep Vanmarcke and Taylor Phinney for some early success while the race is in the north of France.Tours de France 13 Tour wins 0 Stage victories 8 Green jerseys 0 King of the Mountains 0 Days in yellow 7Tour heritage Urán’s stage win and second overall last year changed the equation for worthy triers who had previously placed Bradley Wiggins in third in 2009 (after Lance Armstrong’s disqualification).Team leader Urán strolls through life and bike races with little apparent stress but pulls out a big result just when you’ve forgotten he’s there. The least excitable South American you’ll ever meet.Having secured the services of last year’s polka dot jersey winner, Warren Barguil, this Pro Continental team has taken a significant step to being involved in the business end of the decisive mountain stages. However if this year’s results continue down the same path then they and much of the home supporters are going to be disappointed. Their new star has been dreadful and it could well be a return to sending guys in breaks for some TV time and the odd combativity prize.Tours de France 4 Tour wins 0 Stage victories 0 Green jerseys 0 King of the Mountains 0 Days in yellow 0Tour heritage Made their Tour debut in 2014 as wildcards and were typical plucky French triers, in the break every day.Team leader Barguil came good on all his perceived potential at the 2017 race, two stage wins, the mountain classification and all done with the kind of panache that had the public entranced. Since then the bubbles seem to have left his champagne.With no Thibaut Pinot in the team chasing a GC podium, Marc Madiot’s collective will be aiming to guide Arnaud Démare to more stage success and quite possibly a serious challenge in the points classification. His confidence is high, he can rely on a well drilled leadout train to place him in the right place at the right time and he’s not afraid of a bit of rough and tumble if it’s remotely technical. Arthur Vichot will be expected to participate in proceedings when the hills come along and a top 15 placing in Paris is possible – but a stage win will be more of a priority.Tours de France 21 Tour wins 0 Stage victories 11 Green jerseys 1 King of the Mountains 0 Days in yellow 3Tour heritage Regular stage winners over the years with a podium place in 2014 thanks to Pinot, plus some great histrionics from manager Madiot. Have always made their mark.Team leader Démare already has one Tour stage win and at the age of 26 he’s entering his best years – the expectation that he joins the elite of sprinting is a reasonable wager. Days in the green jersey are on the cards too and if Sagan falters then who knows.One of the few big teams that hasn’t put all its eggs in the sprint or GC camp by having an option for each with Marcel Kittel and Ilnur Zakarin. However with consistency on his side as well as a much more presentable profile, Kittel – the big German – has the advantage of a sprint train that works impeccably. The less reliable Zakarin might make the top 10 on GC but don’t be surprised if he falls off and exits stage left.Tours de France 9 Tour wins 0 Stage victories 7 Green jerseys 0 King of the Mountains 0 Days in yellow 0Tour heritage Hit the jackpot in 2016 with Zakarin’s stage win but were relatively quiet last year with sprinter Alexander Kristoff unable to win a stage.Team leader Kittel knows how to win and when delivered in pole position not many people are capable of getting past him. It’s more a case of how many victories will he get rather than if.Some people were surprised when Dylan Groenewegen won on the Champs Élysées last year but he wasn’t among them. The young Dutchman is fast, confident and increasingly a major threat to the established sprinters so expect to hear his name on a regular basis. The squad’s other rising star, and former ski jumper, Primoz Roglic is progressing nicely as well. His climbing has joined his time trialling and there’s a feeling this year will see a proper GC challenge being mounted. With Steven Kruiswijk and Robert Gesink to keep him company in the mountains he’ll be one to watch.Tours de France 34 Tour wins 0 Stage victories 50 Green jerseys 2 King of the Mountains 2 Days in yellow 10Tour heritage Massively successful through the 1980s under the Superconfex banner, they enjoyed a strong Tour last year thanks to Groenewegen and Roglic, who should improve – drastically – on his 38th place overall last year.Team leader Roglic has steadily got better and this year has taken three stage race victories including the Tour de Romandie where he controlled proceedings with maturity. He won stage 17 last year and finished 38th but I’d expect a major jump up the classification this time around.Anywhere else in the world Lotto Soudal would be that country’s top team – but not in Belgium. However they aren’t intimidated by their rivals and why would they be when they can rely on the massive thighs of their sprinter André Greipel who is a constant threat in any type of bunch kick. Part of the elite when it comes to the fast men, the German sits at the back of an impressive group who know what they are doing when it comes to finishing. When that’s not an option they have Thomas de Gendt to wear down fellow escapees or Tiesj Benoot for a sneaky late attack. No GC ambitions but all that counts is being the best Belgian squad.Tours de France 31 Tour wins 0 Stage victories 33 Green jerseys 3 King of the Mountains 0 Days in yellow 8Tour heritage Have tended to target stage wins rather than the overall apart from in the noughties when Cadel Evans was the leader and managed five days in yellow in 2008. Since Evans’s departure Greipel has picked up a healthy series of sprint victories, the last in 2016.Team leader Greipel, aka the Gorilla. Underneath a scary looking mass of fast twitch muscles lies a perfectly coherent and intelligent person. He’s getting older and slightly slower but you wouldn’t want to suggest that to his face.The Australian team comes to the Tour off the back of an impressive Giro where it was the other Yates twin, Simon, who sparkled. Now it’s Adam’s turn to wear the number one and hopefully improve on his fourth place of 2016 which is looking distinctly possible given his recent runner-up spot at the Dauphiné. He’ll be backed up by a solid group of riders who are more than capable of rivaling their big budget rivals whether that’s in the TTT or the mountains.Tours de France 6 Tour wins 0 Stage victories 3 Green jerseys 0 King of the Mountains 0 Days in yellow 4Tour heritage Have achieved the unique feat of taking the white jersey for best rider under 25 two years running with twin brothers Adam and Simon Yates, who finished fourth and seventh overall respectively in 2016 and 2017.Team leader Adam Yates used to be considered the slightly more explosive of the Yates twins but after brother Simon’s three stage wins at the Giro I think it’s fair to say they’re both excellent. A stage win and a top five on GC is clearly possible.Can you have too much of a good thing? In the case of the Spaniards you can because with three potential claims to the team leader position it might well be a case of too many chiefs when there’s hard graft and sacrifice to be done. Alejandro Valverde has been doing his usual thing of comfortably winning week-long stage races but Mikel Landa and Nairo Quintana have been fairly inconspicuous. Too often the race tactics have fallen on the conservative side and if they are going to win a Tour they’ll need to be a bit more adventurous.Founded 1980 Bike Canyon Manager Eusebio Unzué Sponsor business Mobile phone company Tours de France 36 Tour wins 7 Stage victories 31 Green jerseys 0 King of the Mountains 1 Days in yellow 73Tour heritage Goes back to the 1980s with Pedro Delgado, hit the jackpot in the early 90s with Miguel Indurain and managed an anonymous win in the 2006 Tour with Óscar Pereiro after Floyd Landis’s drug ban.Team leader Quintana carries the badge of leader but realistically Landa is on an equal footing. The Colombian gets the nod as he’s the one with previous GT winning credentials but he’ll need his best form just to be top dog in his own team.The self-proclaimed Wolfpack has the most race wins in the World Tour this year and with the eight flat stages more than likely to end in a bunch sprint it’s highly probable the Belgians will be adding to that number. The reduction in team sizes won’t affect their leadouts at all as even explosive climber Julian Alaphilippe is capable of 60kph if needs be. With the best tactical awareness in a stage finish and Fernando Gaviria the ever-rising newcomer of the sprinting elite, they could well be in the yellow and green jerseys for a while.Tours de France 15 Tour wins 0 Stage victories 33 Green jerseys 1 King of the Mountains 2 Days in yellow 10Tour heritage Prolific stage hunters – Marcel Kittel landed five last year before heading for Katyusha – while Dan Martin finished ninth and sixth overall in 2016 and 2017. Less about the overall this year but the stage wins should keep coming.Team leader Gaviria comes to the Tour already having been a points classification and four-times stage winner at last year’s Giro. Not afraid of anyone or any reputations he’s the most exciting sprinter since Mark Cavendish burst on to the scene.The defending champions are going through a bit of a storm this year but it’s been business as usual on the bikes, so while the media debates the team continues its dominance of stage racing. Chris Froome will face more hostility than he did at the Giro but he seems impervious to everything thrown his way. If he falters, and that’s unlikely, then there’s Geraint Thomas and Wout Poels waiting in the wings to take over. The one to watch here is the young Colombian Egan Bernal who has been sensational just lately. Any one of the Sky line-up could be in yellow at any time but it’s in Paris that they are really planning for. The favourites for the win.Tours de France 8 Tour wins 5 Stage victories 15 Green jerseys 0 King of the Mountains 1 Days in yellow 77Tour heritage Controversial admittedly, but dominant in recent years apart from 2014. No stage win for Froome last year but Thomas’s prologue victory meant they led the race for 19 of the 21 days.Team leader Chris Froome has won every Grand Tour now so his place in history is guaranteed, however there’s the matter of joining the select club that have five Tour victories.The development of Sunweb and Tom Dumoulin go hand in hand. Not quite at the level of Sky and Movistar, they have a certain vulnerability in the mountains as does their leader but everywhere else they can force a selection. With Michael Matthews taking some of the attention in the first half of the race the team can cover two objectives at the same time. Green jersey for the Australian and in the process protect Dumoulin for the GC.Founded 2005 Bike Giant Manager Iwan Spekenbrink Sponsor business Tour operator Tours de France 7 Tour wins 0 Stage victories 15 Green jerseys 1 King of the Mountains 1 Days in yellow 2Tour heritage Matthews and Warren Barguil produced a stellar Tour last year with two stage wins apiece and the green and polka-dot jerseys. That will take some beating.Team leader Dumoulin arrives at the Tour as a Grand Tour winner and that changes how seriously he’ll be watched and how the race will be ridden tactically. The world time-trial champion has no fear of riding alone and it’s only his high mountain performance which will be a question mark. Also: has he recovered from this year’s Giro?Missing a big GC challenger and a top level sprinter, it’s hard to see what these guys are going to get out of a Tour which will be a tale of two halves. Classic style for the first bit and then proper mountains for the second. It would be easy to discount John Degenkolb from the harder sprint finishes but that applies equally to Peter Sagan. Bauke Mollema might ride into a top 10 place but competition is fierce with the arrival of some new faces – and the Dutchman isn’t getting any younger. They’ll need to race smart to win a stage.Tours de France 7 Tour wins 0 Stage victories 5 Green jerseys 0 King of the Mountains 0 Days in yellow 10Tour heritage It was all about Fabian Cancellara in the early years –the Swiss led the Tour for the first week in 2012 – and later Alberto Contador flew the flag in his twilight years. Mollema’s stage win last year was a bonus but will be hard to repeat.Team leader Mollema is one of those riders who makes the front group in the mountains on a regular basis but then doesn’t survive the next selection when the real GC contenders let rip. And he usually has one bad day which sees him tumble out of a podium challenge. However the Dutchman is a wily character and a stage win isn’t out of the question.After a disastrous Giro d’Italia, UAE willing be hoping Dan Martin and Alexander Kristoff deliver something in line with the budget that’s been committed to this project. The Irishman had a poor start to the season but things have improved with the warmer weather and he had a promising Dauphine. The current European champion, Kristoff is in a similar position and still searching for his top form. The first few stages will need to be good to him otherwise it’ll be all in for the GC.Founded 1990 Bike Colnago Manager Giuseppe Saronni Sponsor business Airline company Tours de France 20 Tour wins 0 Stage victories 13 Green jerseys 2 King of the Mountains 0 Days in yellow 2Tour heritage Started life as the Lampre team, who tended to come to the Tour worn out from the Giro, making the Tour something of an afterthought in their new guise they propelled Louis Meintjes to eighth overall last year and will look to improve again this July.Team leader Martin has made the transition from being mainly a one day hilly Classic type to become a solid top 10 GT rider. His last two Tours have seen him finish ninth and sixth so with that he’ll be aiming for a podium spot. Not as ridiculous as it sounds with so little time trialling.This Belgian outfit provides the entertainment before the main event kicks off so expect a man in every break and a few top 10 sprint results when it’s technical or dangerous. They are nothing if not tenacious although a stage win will be a surprise, so realistically the combativity prize is their daily objective and anything else will be a bonus.Founded 2008 Bike Cube Manager Jean-François Bourlaert Sponsor business Construction and recyclingconstruction materials supplierTours de France 1 Tour wins 0 Stage victories 0 Green jerseys 0 King of the Mountains 0 Days in yellow 0Tour heritage Last year was their first appearance and they rode it in the French way, getting in the break every day without fail and placing Guillaume Martin a consistent but unspectacular 23rd overall.Team leader Will be decided alphabetically or maybe Yoann Offredo because he’s French and that’ll get some media coverage.

Bartlett Sher’s much-lauded Lincoln Center production is handsomely mounted and boasts two star performances from Kelli O’Hara and Ken Watanabe but, in addressing the musical’s dated premise, it creates further problems.Normally we see the show as a closet romance in which a spirited young governess, Anna Leonowens, wins the heart and mind of the King of Siam whose children she has been hired to educate. In this version, however, the real battle goes on within the soul of the king himself. He is partly a testy patriarch, partly an anxious politician who sees his neighbours succumbing to colonialism. The conflict is expressed in the number A Puzzlement, which Yul Brynner often arbitrarily cut when he played the role. Watanabe makes it clear, however, that the king faces a dilemma as he asks: “Shall I join other nations in alliance, If allies are weak am I not best alone?” All this is fascinating and Sher’s production is at pains to point up the isions within the kingdom. In Western People Funny, the monarch’s wives highlight the absurdity of being dolled up in alien underwear. The celebrated ballet based on Uncle Tom’s Cabin – which, although derived from Jerome Robbins’s original choreography, goes on far too long – also seems like a calculated provocation: I was reminded more than once of the play scene in Hamlet. But the focus on regal insecurity and the threat to Siam’s integrity only serves to complicate the musical. I found myself asking a simple question: why on earth would Mrs Leonowens want to stay? If there is one thing worse than a despot, which the king undoubtedly is, it is a neurotic despot. Even if I never felt there was much kinship between the story’s dual protagonists, O’Hara, who won a Tony award for her performance, is a delight. She suggests a woman who is both spirited and sweet-natured and not only enunciates every syllable of her songs but invests them with emotion. I’ve never heard Hello Young Lovers better delivered: when O’Hara announces “I know how it feels to have wings on your heels” a light comes into her eyes as if she is reliving her past. O’Hara’s Anna is also at ease with the king’s multiple children, whom she swings merrily around, underscoring the point that her commitment is less to the king than to future generations. Watanabe presents us with a troubled tyrant who, in his idea of building a wall around his kingdom and his condemnation of “a false lie”, momentarily reminded me of you-know-who. It is a fine piece of acting but, aside from a moment when Watanabe mischievously smiles as he sees Anna courting his attention, it rarely made me feel the king was emotionally entangled with his employee. In a predominantly Asian cast, there is good work from Na-Young Jeon as a renegade lover and Naoko Mori as the king’s head wife Michael Yeargan’s colourful designs avoid false exoticism and the pit band, under Stephen Ridley, plays excellently. The musical itself, however, remains, a problem to be solved as much as a show to be enjoyed. •The King and I is at the London Palladium until 29 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e232d377d70f440a917d234e406dc9dd8556cef/0_374_5743_3446/master/5743.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a6647a865999383cf1957f29ecd84e4","title":"miss littlewood review joan littlewood rsc","story":"The Swan, Stratford-upon-AvonClare Burt passes on the trademark cap to six other actors who all share the role of the pioneering director in Sam Kenyon’s engaging musical tributeAs a nomadic theatrical pioneer who finally found a home at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, Joan Littlewood would be astonished to find her life and work being celebrated in a musical by the Avon. Even if the peculiar nature of her genius often eludes Sam Kenyon, who has done the book, music and lyrics, it is hard not to warm to a show that introduces a new generation to the huge debt British theatre owes her. Kenyon’s most radical idea is to have no less than seven actors represent his heroine: a way of signalling her ersity as well as being a nod to Shakespeare’s seven ages speech. Clare Burt is the mature Joan, supposedly in charge of proceedings. Joan’s trademark black cap is, however, passed from head to head as she looks back over her life. She starts out as an illegitimate south London kid, wins a scholarship to Rada and goes on to make BBC radio documentaries in 1930s Manchester. It is there that she gets involved in leftwing theatre groups, co-founds the itinerant Theatre Workshop and, after it settles in east London in 1953, is acclaimed for her productions of A Taste of Honey, The Hostage and Oh What a Lovely War. Kenyon rightly seizes on key aspects of Littlewood’s life, above all her belief in the ensemble principle that made her regard desertion as a personal betrayal along with her devotion to the company’s manager, Gerry Raffles, whose death in 1975 killed her creative urge. But in reminding us of Littlewood’s antiestablishment ferocity, championship of new writers and belief that theatre should be available to everyone, Kenyon overlooks other aspects of her credo. We forget now that Littlewood had a deep knowledge of the classics and characteristically advised a young Shelagh Delaney to go away and read Ibsen. The improvisatory fluidity of her productions was also deceptive. “Her shows,” the actor Murray Melvin once told me, “were as carefully structured as a Mozart symphony.” This show may not portray Littlewood in her entirety, but Kenyon pays due tribute to a tenacity that saw her in constant conflict with a miserly Arts Council. His songs also remind us that she regarded music as a vital component of theatre. In Stratford East, at the start of the second half, is a delightful hymn to the rat-ridden palace of varieties that she and Raffles turned into a theatrical mecca. A later song, A Little Bit of Business, is full of the pluck and cheek that shows why Barbara Windsor immediately became one of the discerning Littlewood’s great discoveries. Erica Whyman’s production reproduces the seamless mix of story, music and movement that was Littlewood’s hallmark. It is as if we are seeing Joan’s methods applied to her life. Passing the cap like the baton in a relay race, the actors who represent her – Burt, Emily Johnstone, Aretha Ayeh, Sophia Nomvete, Sandy Foster, Amanda Hadingue, Dawn Hope – admirably bring out multiple facets of her character, from her missionary fervour to her bullying possessiveness. But, if anything surprises me about this engaging musical, it is Kenyon’s stress on the ultimate solitude of this charismatic revolutionary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af4b382e9bbe9af38a2d1624c2e84d92a37ce611/0_46_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae844571c8e1923abbaef9edc6433c7b","title":"share your favourite family barbecue pics and win with birra moretti","story":"Celebrate the quintessential British summer tradition with Birra Moretti and you could win a countertop draught beer system for your home, plus a £250 Red Letter Days voucherWhat is it about summer that makes it so fantastic to cook in the great outdoors?

Across wide lanes of traffic – ceaseless, even at this hour – I can just about make out the dark silhouette of Hyde Park’s trees. But it is a dozen plastic-wrapped parking tickets, slapped on a primary-coloured Lamborghini beside me, that I can hear flapping in the breeze.I am at the Hilton Park Lane hotel, the super-rich heart of the super-rich centre of London. The sports cars are not only symbols of extreme wealth, but of the attitudes that accompany it, that allow the car-owners to treat parking fines as if they were an upmarket meter system.Tonight, the latter is prophetic. The velvet rope separating the “abnoxious” from the rest of us is struggling to contain a show-stoppingly beautiful black woman, who is shouting at the door staff.“They know me. They invited me down here. And now they don’t want to let me in because of my colour,” she yells. “Don’t deny the fact that black people are poppin’. You play our music. Do I need to say any more?”When I talk to the 24-year-old, she explains why she is so furious at being denied entry. “I’ve been standing in the line and seeing bare white people going in before me,” she says. “Personally, I think this is a colour thing. Black people are not allowed in central London, I swear to you. The way Mayfair works for me, you’ve got to look like a certain something – you have got to be white, tall, really slim.”She describes herself as an “influencer” and says she does not want to be named because she fears the consequences to her profile. But, she continues: “I’m a party girl, I go out all the time. And as black women, we are always being disrespected – we can’t go out there and have a good time, without them reminding us about our colour.”In this sentiment she is not alone. Last month, another young black woman, out clubbing to celebrate the end of her exams, alleged that she was charged twice as much for entry to Drama as white girls in the queue. The club denied that this was the case, saying that both white and black members of the group were charged £20 for entry.“We do not tolerate any form of discrimination against any inidual or group,” the club said in a statement. “The standard door charge at Drama Park Lane is £20. Promotions are offered for various reasons, but never on the grounds of discrimination of race, colour or national origin.” The club is now investigating both the allegations.But on social media, the young woman’s mother, TV producer Nadine Marsh-Edwards, said: “My daughter went to a club in the West End last night. Black girls got charged £20 entrance fee – white girls £10 … London life right now. They need to be reminded it’s London 2018 not Mississippi 1962.”The club contacted Marsh-Edwards, although her comments have led to further allegations, many citing almost identical experiences, throwing a spotlight on reviews of Mayfair clubs on TripAdvisor, where allegations of racism are common, stretching back several years.On the night I went clubbing in Mayfair I saw this flexible door policy at first hand. Drama’s £20 entry fee was quickly waved away when I made a vague excuse, leaving me the impression that it is considered small change when compared to the takings inside.Until about a decade ago, I was no stranger to the Mayfair and central-London club scene. Devotees of hip-hop and R\u0026ampB, my friends and I knew the DJ schedule at most of the clubs by heart, and would go wherever they were playing our favourite music. On a good day, we could blag our way in for free, but most of the time, we paid £10 or £20. But, as a black girl, you always felt your game had to be tight. Those of mixed race, like me, had an easier time than our friends with darker complexions who seemed to be judged more critically by doorstaff. The threat of exclusion was always lurking just under the surface.But, descending beneath the Lamborghini-lined entrance to Drama, those days seem like a more innocent time. The first thing that struck me was the prevalence of cosmetic surgery. Next, that this was a club devoted not to dancing, but to “tables” – booths topped with grey ice buckets for super-sized, frosted bottles of spirits that cost those enjoying them up to £1,000. The dancefloor is an afterthought – a few square metres of space we had to share with a disproportionate number of security guards and a couple of women in thongs, who occassionally burst into unprovoked episodes of twerking. Champagne, the drink of choice at the bar, was an eye-watering £17 a glass.About a quarter of the club’s floor space was shut off altogether – an unoccupied and unlit VIP area. It felt like a metaphor for the whole experience of going to a club that is always aspiring to a wealthier, more important and famous clientele.During the period I was in the club, out of about 150 clubbers, I saw just one group of five bored-looking black boys, slumped around a table, and one black woman in a large table-less group of white friends. Among the staff, we observed just one black man.When we moved on to nearby Scandal, a larger club closer to the heart of the West End, there were more people dancing. There were also slightly more people from minority ethnic groups and a black DJ. But with the exception of one dancer among the half-dozen or so women performing provocative moves in little cubby holes built into the walls, I could see no black women at all. The club declined to comment.It is black women, critics say, who are the net losers in the current Mayfair club game. Fashion blogger Fisayo Longe recently described her experience at Libertine, writing that she was denied entry and was told it was: “Maybe because you’re black,” and “… probably because you’re not good looking enough”. The nightclub has denied this, saying the records from their ID scanner prove they have a varied demographic. “We can categorically state that we do not have a door policy that is based on the colour of people’s skin.”In 2015, the nightclub DSTRKT refused entry to a group of black women who say they were told they were “too dark” and “overweight”. The nightclub denied this and says the club was full. The same year, Cirque le Soir rejected a group of New Orleans Saints NFL players, despite the fact that they had reservations. The players reported being told it was because they were “six big guys” (none was over 6ft) and “too urban”. The nightclub denied this, saying the men were refused entry because they were in an all-male group.TripAdvisor reviews of the past few years report clubs including Libertine, Drama and Cirque le Soir splitting up mixed groups of friends, with only the white members allowed in. “Eww, your kind isn’t allowed in here,” one girl reports a staff member telling her and an Asian friend. Other reviews of some Mayfair clubs dating back to January 2017 include the headlines “undercover Nazis” and “Racist Club! No black people allowed!” But in a society where British people of colour face discrimination at work, racist abuse on the streets and even deportation, do unpleasant experiences at a handful of nightclubs really matter?Marsh-Edwards thinks so. “This is the start of a young person’s life out in the world, and these sort of micro-aggressions tell you a lot about how you are seen by society,” she says. “Some of these girls are going to end up running companies, they are going to go into that boardroom one day, probably as the only woman and highly likely the only black person. And they have already been told they are not worthy, and not on a level playing field.”In a world where discretion is seen as a core asset, it was difficult to find anyone who works in the Mayfair club scene who would allow their name to be used for this article. One promoter, who is black, says he witnessed overt racial discrimination over more than a decade working in Mayfair and the West End. “I can go into any club with 10 hot, blond models and be given a table and a bottle,” he says. “But I can go with 10 black girls, who are beautiful, and be kept on the door.“I used to have so many fights with club-owners about this. My own sister got turned away on her 40th birthday from a club I was working at – she came with six black women, they had booked a table two months in advance and there was nothing I could do to get them in. Well-dressed, smart-looking black people getting turned away.” Despite his personal objection to the policy, he continued making money from it. “I was walking away with hundreds of pounds for bringing in girls. The clubs would do a ‘quality check’ – they would give you marks out of 10 for the girls that you bring. They just need to be hot. Hot, and predominantly white.A popular Mayfair club DJ argued that while there was undoubtedly racism, it was elitism that was the main issue. “I remember once bringing two black friends to a club where I worked, and being told: ‘You cannot bring two black people in here at the same time because it looks like a gang.’ So I’m not going to deny there is racism. Some of it comes from the way the media portrays black people. Some is similar to the racism you get in the fashion industry, with this idea that black people just don’t look good.“But this is not so much about race as about money,” he says, describing how a pair of Nigerian clients at Drama regularly spent £30,000 each visiting the club. “Clubs want to attract the people who are going to spend the most, so they want good-looking people, people who look desirable and enticing, because that’s what brings in the people with money. That can work against black people, but I’ve seen it work in favour of black people too.”The importance of catering to the tastes of the super-rich is a recurring theme. Another promoter, who specialises in bringing clientele from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states to London’s clubs, said it was deciphering their wishes that led to some of the most problematic decision-making in some Mayfair clubs.“The objective of these clubs is to sell alcohol, and club-owners have built up stereotypes based on spending patterns,” he explains. “So, for example, some owners will tell you that they don’t want Asians coming in because they drink before they come out. Black people don’t drink much either. The best clients are Norwegians, because they drink a lot. So there is a kind of logic behind the way they discriminate.“Right now, it’s ‘Gulf season’. Societies like Saudi are very restrictive, but Ramadan is especially strict, so as soon as it’s finished, wealthy young people go to the other extreme. All the luxury industries in Europe try to cater to them.” Essentially, racialised stereotypes are being cited as a business model.Yet the serious nature and sheer volume of allegations of racial discrimination have attracted the attention of the local authorities, which are now investigating. When I put the allegations to Amy Lamé, London’s first night tsar, appointed by mayor Sadiq Khan, she said she was in touch with those involved. “We take these allegations extremely seriously and are working with Westminster council and the politan police to stamp this out.”A spokesperson from the council, which has responsibility for licensing – powers some have suggested should now be used to sanction nightclubs who practise discrimination – explained its plans to tackle the allegations: “Racism has no place in Westminster. That is why we have this week launched a task group to look into the standards of inclusion and access to the evening and night-time economy. This will include trading standards and issues such as discounted entry and promotions. If we find evidence of any racial discrimination we will take action.”But evidence could be hard to find. One promoter I spoke to said he could see why black clubbers claimed racism was involved, but insisted: “These clubs are based on image. The reason people come here is because of the exclusivity and glamour. If we let all of them in, it would no longer be either exclusive or glamorous. So in a way, by coming here and getting upset when they get rejected, they are victims of their own fantasy.”Is racism, even if it can be proved, actually a symptom rather than the cause of what is really going wrong in Mayfair clubs? The clubs I visited – Drama and Scandal – are unapologetic about their intentions to be elitist and discriminatory, not on grounds on race, but desirability, beauty and wealth. Scandal, for example, describes itself as “the ultimate nightlife experience for a privileged few”. It is hard not to feel unwelcome in a club that plays black music, in a city with a visible black community, where black people are noticeable by their absence. It was uncomfortable for my friend Lola and I, doing our best to enjoy the music amid the tables, stunts and strippers. But, when you consider what it says about our society, and how we cater to the whims of the super-rich, it really means a whole lot more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/362643e5f82c08abf1a08de191be783ccba3e511/0_145_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e89d0c59e7d4be90dc035260ef4a181","title":"wednesday briefing unknown substance alert in wiltshire","story":"Two critically ill and major incident declared … England through to World Cup quarter finals … and include the neighbours in your nude sunbathing plansTwo critically ill and major incident declared … England through to World Cup quarter finals … and include the neighbours in your nude sunbathing plansHello, I’m Warren Murray with the news to start your Wednesday.Salisbury hospital is at the centre of another major incident this morning as a woman and a man lie critically ill from a possible poisoning.Authorities say the couple in their 40s were initially thought to have fallen victim to tainted heroin or crack cocaine after they were found unconscious at an Amesbury address on Saturday evening. “However, further testing is now ongoing to establish the substance which led to these patients becoming ill and we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding this incident,” said a police statement.

It will make the NHS the first health service in the world to routinely offer genomic medicine. The service will at first focus mainly on cancers and rare diseases but in future may be used to pre-empt adverse drug reactions and reveal the risk of severe early onset diseases such as Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis and dementia. The scheme comes in from 1 October in England, with discussions under way about possibly extending it to the devolved regions.Baby murder arrest – A healthcare worker is suspected of murdering eight babies and attempting to kill another six at the Countess of Chester hospital. In all, the police investigation covers the deaths of 17 babies and 15 non-fatal collapses between March 2015 and July 2016. The hospital was recently found to have had the highest neonatal mortality rate of all similar-sized facilities in Britain in 2015. Its maternity unit has been downgraded after an official report criticised staffing levels and procedures.Go for walks, they said – Doing 10,000 steps a day is not enough exercise unless you are carrying a decent load of shopping for at least some of it. Public Health England says strength and balancing exercises are also needed, especially for people aged over 40. As well as long walks “you should also do yoga or tai chi or racket sports or resistance training which could be in a structured exercise class. You can do two long sessions a week,” says Louise Ansari from the Centre for Ageing Better. Always using the stairs, making a point of carrying heavy things and dance of all sorts are also good, says Ansari. “As long as you are feeling the ache in your muscles.”Bums away – “The recent police advice about warning your neighbours if you’re going to sunbathe naked in your garden is fine if it’s general advice, but it’s not in any sense a legal requirement.” The bare facts from Andrew Welch of British Naturism, after Surrey police said those planning any gardening in the buff during the warm weather needed to be mindful of others.

File photograph: Nick BradshawThe gender gap at the top in the Department of Finance is “unacceptable”, Paschal Donohoe has admitted.He acknowledged there is “a lot of progress to make” to address the disparity between men and women in the most senior positions there, but said he expected that to change over time. Mr Donohoe said there was greater equality at principal officer and assistant principal officer level and he expected to see that over time at the highest level.He pointed out that women were in senior positions in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, at a level “above the Civil Service average”.But he agreed that women at all grades who take time out to have children are paying a penalty in terms of promotion, status and pay.He said the time taken for maternity leave and, to a far lesser extent for paternity leave, “is a sliver of an entire working life” and all Government departments are working to “ensure nobody is penalised in any way for taking maternity leave”.Mr Donohoe, who is Minister in both departments, was responding to Labour finance spokeswoman Joan Burton who said the cliché of “male, pale and stale” came immediately to mind in relation to the Department of Finance.During question time in the Dáil, the former tánaiste said in Finance “the men occupy a disproportionate amount of the senior positions while women are congregated in the lower pay scales and grades”.Figures released by the Minister show that four of the nine most senior positions in Public Expenditure and Reform are held by women, which is above the average for the Civil Service.But “the seven equivalent positions in the Department of Finance are all currently occupied by men”, he said.The statistics also show that women make up 54 per cent of all staff in Public Expenditure and Reform and just under 43 per cent in Finance.There is a clear majority of women (70.9 per cent in Public Expenditure and 62 per cent in Finance) working at clerical officer and executive officer grades.Women make up 47 per cent of those serving in the management roles of principal officer and assistant principal officer in Public Expenditure and 39 per cent in Finance.Mr Donohoe said a target of 50:50 gender balance in new appointments at senior level is now in place. The ‘best person for the job’ approach is still in place but where candidates are of equal merit, then priority is given to a female candidate.Ms Burton, referring to her own time in government, said she knew what it was like to sit in Cabinet where only four of about 18 people were female.She added that for every extra woman appointed “one changes the conversation and the lived experience of those who are making the decisions”.The Minister said the ision of leadership positions between men and women in Finance “is not where it needs to be” and he agreed with Ms Burton that “the leadership of our Government departments needs to reflect the ersity and strength of our country”.He said in Finance “we clearly have a lot of progress to make in that at senior level” but not in Public Expenditure."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3553406.1530687189!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"large breweries pay publicans not to stock smaller companies beer cider","story":"Labour TD Alan Kelly has alleged in the Dáil that large breweries are offering publicans incentives not to stock the beers and ciders of smaller competitors on tap in their premises.

Mr Coveney is also scheduled to meet Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer.His spokesman said that Mr Coveney would be “hammering home the consistent and identical message from the Taoiseach, Jean Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk, Michel Barnier and the EU27 that Britain must deliver legally on the commitments made in December and in March and in all circumstances must protect peace in Northern Ireland with the guarantee of no hard border.”Meanwhile, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland after the UK leaves the EU was about “much more” than trade and money.Speaking to reporters at the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street, Mr Varadkar was asked which was more important: a resolution to the Border issue that has ground down talks between the EU or UK, or a post-Brexit EU-UK trade deal.“They’re both important, but the issue of avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland is about much more than trade and about much more than money,” he said.“It is about maintaining our peace process and allowing people that live on either side of the Border to continue to lead normal lives and to lead peaceful lives.”He would not comment on the UK government’s so-called white paper on London’s latest proposal that is reported to keep the UK tied to European market rules for goods post-Brexit until he saw it.British prime minister Theresa May is aiming to sign off on the UK’s plan at a key meeting of her Cabinet on Friday.Mr Varadkar said that he believed a hard border would be avoided.The tricky part in Brexit negotiations was, he said, ensuring free trade between the UK and the EU, including Ireland, post-Brexit.“The only barrier to achieving those things is the UK’s own red lines, but if they soften, Europe will be flexible,” he said.Mr Varadkar said there were “real risks” from the potential impact of Brexit which was why it must be “as soft as possible and to have a transitional period.”“Any move towards protectionism is something that we oppose and a real risk,” he said.The Taoiseach said that he was unaware of reports that the Revenue Commissioners were scouting locations for possible border checkpoints in the event of no Brexit deal to avoid a hard border under contingency plans.“If they are, they are certainly are not doing it at the direction of Government and if they are, they can stop,” he said.“We are not contemplating a physical border between Northern Ireland and Ireland that is simply not going to happen.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

He said the Taoiseach and the Government strongly support a free and independent media. “I unreservedly support the operation and function of the media in our democracy,” the Dublin Central TD said. “It is essential that we have a free and independent media.”“Mr Varadkar needs to clarify his comments as a matter of urgency. If the object of the visit to New York was to project Ireland as a modern democracy then expressing sympathy with Donald Trump’s views on the media was a spectacular own goal by An Taoiseach. “Freedom of expression is a core principle of the United Nations. Donald Trump has shown nothing but contempt for the media and it is disturbing that Mr Varadkar should in any way align himself with the views of the American president on this issue.“An Taoiseach’s criticism of RTÉ is especially concerning since the public service broadcaster since it suggests a hostility towards an organisation which, by definition, requires the goodwill and support of government. His reported comments on Prime Time, if true are gratuitous and insulting.”Meanwhile, Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy said the Taoiseach’s comments were “taken out of context” and expected him to clarify his remarks in the Dáil later on Wednesday.Speaking on RTE’s Morning Ireland, Mr Murphy said:“From what I’ve seen about what he’s reported to have said I think he’s been taken out of context...I’m sure he’ll get an opportunity to clarify if it’s raised in the Dail later on. “I know in clarifying them he’ll be making a very robust defence of an independent media because that’s what he believes.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3552736.1530634201!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"athens keeps apprehensive eye on erdogan and dodecanese islands","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPoster for Turkey’s  president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, at Taksim Square in Istanbul: it reads “Thank you Istanbul”.  Photograph: Bulent KilicAFPGetty We are fortunate in Europe in the sense that we haven’t had a major military conflict since the collapse of Yugoslavia and the Bosnian-Serb conflict of the 1990s. Maybe we are also fortunate that the refugee crisis is making us aware of wars elsewhere and the need for conciliation and mutual respect.But there are invisible wars continuing: wars of attrition, wars of diplomacy, economic wars which don’t need bombs, gas masks or even verbal abuse but which thrive on factors which are just as insidious as ethnic cleansing, terrorism and religious prejudice.Turkey may not officially be at war, but the narrow victory of President Recip Erdogan in last month’s elections will certainly increase the levels of aggression on which he, as executive president, will be able to operate. At home, Erdogan has not only effectively declared war on the opposition (imprisoning dissident academics, teachers and journalists) but makes no secret of his determination to suppress, if not exterminate, the Kurdish minority.Greece is watching Erdogan’s success with apprehension. He has already carried his arguments into the enemy camp during his state visit here last December when he spoke of rescinding the international treaties under which the Dodecanese islands (including Rhodes, Kos and Patmos) became part of Greece in 1947.Twice in the past 30 years, Greece and Turkey have been on the brink of war over the ownership of such islands. And Erdogan has indicated that he regards the citizens of northeastern Greece, who happen to be Muslim, as more properly part of his own Islamic hegemony.Wars therefore do not require military violence to become acts of hostility. Turkish warplanes provocatively entering Greek airspace are a tragedy waiting to happen and could precipitate a territorial conflict.And wars are not always fought for their ostensible reasons. The Greek war of independence was more about weakening the Ottoman empire (the “sick man of Europe”) than about freedom for Greeks. Turkey was a threat to the Austro-Hungarian empire because it controlled most of the Balkan region including the lands that are modern Greece. The states of Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Macedonia came into existence as and when it suited the Great Powers to create them.The “war” of the Grexit, when it looked as if Greece would leave the euro zone and revert to the drachma, wasn’t about saving the Greek economy (which was almost “dead in the Med” anyway) but about safeguarding the euro itself and the German and French banks which had over-lent to Greece.It was about saving the architects of the euro zone from a horrendous own goal. The destruction of the Greek economy and the near-collapse of the Italian, Spanish, Irish and Portuguese exchequers were the result of war-by-banking and war-by-chicanery.The “war” of the refugee crisis is being fought not so much to protect the Syrians and Afghans but to test Europe’s capacity for humanitarian compassion against its equal and opposite capacity to repel what it does not understand. Syria’s internal war, the ubiquitous Islamic State and the Middle East conflicts are challenging Europe’s conscience by fuelling its fears.The next “war”, to protect Europe from itself, will be fought not to respect the democratic rights of Italians, Greeks, Catalans or Basques but to copperfasten the hegemony of the northern states.The situation in Turkey, with a virtual dictatorship sitting on Europe’s doorstep, must make both the European centrists and expansionists fearful for the alleged ideals of the European founders: democracy, justice, free trade and movement of peoples and ideas, all of which are challenged by Greece’s nearest and most aggressive neighbour, Turkey.Erdogan’s slim 52 per cent majority will probably enlarge, rather than diminish, his single-minded aggressiveness, since he still has much to fear at home. Although he has made many Turks more prosperous and has a strong domestic economy, his politics are scaring away the chance of capital investment.Nevertheless, bankers lend to strong men, not to wimps. Meanwhile he can afford, literally, to condescend to Greece, where the average worker pays well over 50 per cent of income in taxes – direct, indirect and social security – and the prospects of economic recovery at a national level remain remote.Turkey is outside the EU and is likely to stay there. But its virtual dictatorship mirrors the would-be dictatorships within the EU of Viktor Orban’s Hungary and Jaroslaw Kaczynski’s Poland. As President Michael D Higgins emphasised in Greece in February and again last month in Latvia, it is in the smaller countries that many of the answers to Europe’s problems may be found."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3552861.1530643423!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hammond to prioritise business at british cabinet brexit meeting","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond:  “I will argue for a future relationship with the European Union that protects our important supply chains, protects British jobs and protects British business.” Photograph: Simon DawsonReutersBritain’s chancellor Philip Hammond has told MPs he will press the case for a Brexit that prioritises business interests when the cabinet meets at Chequers on Friday.

I was very honest in my assessment, including when I spoke to prime minister May last week. The sooner we get a precise UK proposal on the Irish Border, the better the chance to finalise the Brexit negotiations this year.\u0026nbspPut simply: we cannot make progress unless a solid backstop is presented by the UK and accepted by our Irish friends,” he told the European Parliament in Strasbourg.As the government remained tight-lipped about Ms May’s new proposal for customs arrangements with the EU, Brexiteer backbenchers warned the prime minister against compromising her negotiating red lines. Former Northern Ireland secretary Owen Patterson said on Tuesday that Britain should be preparing for a no-deal Brexit.Meanwhile, pressure increased on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to back a referendum on the final Brexit deal after Unite the Union endorsed the possibility of a second vote. The union drew back from the most radical anti-Brexit position of calling for a fresh referendum but delegates at its annual conference backed a motion stating that the union should be “open to the possibility of a popular vote being held on any deal, depending on political circumstances”.The union’s leader Len McCluskey said that, although the majority of Labour party members don’t want Brexit, most of its voters do.“Let me be clear, we are not calling for a second referendum,” he said. “In or out of the EU matters less than getting the Tories out of office and Jeremy Corbyn into No 10.”"},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.Wiltshire \u0026#39major incident\u0026#39: Amesbury pair critically ill after exposure to \u0026#39unknown substance\u0026#39 near SalisburySon of Isil leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi \u0026#39killed fighting in Syria\u0026#39Thailand cave rescue: Meet the \u0026#39A-Team\u0026#39 of heroic volunteer British ers who led searchJuly 4th 2018: How a tax on playing cards and a thwarted tea shipment led to American Independence DayIsle of Bute murder inquiry: Locals warned to keep watch over children after girl, 6, found deadChester hospital baby deaths: Nurse Lucy Letby arrested on suspicion of murdering eight babiesMalaysia\u0026#39s ex-premier Najib Razak pleads not guilty to charges over corruption scandalMichael Gove says Electoral Commission will be \u0026#39challenged legally\u0026#39 as he distances himself from Vote Leave allegationsWoman, 92, shoots son dead over decision to put her in care home, US authorities sayPolish Supreme Court chief justice turns up to work in defiance of retirement law being challenged by EUWhat is the \u0026#39First Past The Post\u0026#39 voting system?What is Article 50?

Even firms who do not trade across borders backed alternatives to\u0026nbspmax-fac by a two-to-one margin.While big businesses were least likely to express support for max-fac, no size category of firm backed it overall, the survey by the Institute of Directors (IoD) found.The figures will be seen as a blow to the governments’ faltering Brexit plans and come just a day after the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) warned that the patience of UK businesses was reaching “breaking point”.It found that fundamental questions on trade, tax and customs had yet to be answered and that, out of 23 areas it identified as key for business, the government had made a start on addressing just two.Now the IoD\u0027s\u0026nbsppoll has heaped more pressure on Theresa May’s team.On standards and regulations, 55 per cent of directors said they believe that maximising EU market access and minimising regulatory ergence was most important for their organisation.Business pleads for Brexit sense but you know what Brexiteers will sayBusinesses\u0027 patience at \u0027breaking point\u0027 over BrexitMinisters told to ditch \u0027fallacy\u0027 of securing easy Brexit trade dealsUK legally bound to pay £39bn Brexit bill \u0027before EU trade deal\u0027That was well ahead of the 15 per cent who said tailoring standards to domestic needs was most important or the 12 per cent who backed realigning rules with other countries such as the US.HM Revenue and Customs warned in May that max-fac\u0026nbspcould cost firms £20bn\u0026nbspa year.\u0026nbspThe organisation’s chief executive, Jon Thompson, told MPs the option of a “highly streamlined customs arrangement” would be significantly more costly than a more comprehensive customs partnership.Cabinet ministers are set to meet at Chequers on Friday to discuss another new approach to Brexit from Number 10, details of which have yet to be revealed.“As the Government discusses options for post-Brexit customs this week, they should take note of the strong preference among business leaders for a solution which keeps trade friction to an absolute minimum,” said Stephen Martin, Director General of the IoD.\u0026nbsp“Pursuing an option that relies on facilitations and simplifications doesn’t seem to cut it for our members. In short, ‘max fac’ is not the favoured route for keeping trade in full flow.“We’re in uncharted territory here, and so far we have no clarity on what customs position the UK will adopt. What is clear, however, is that the firms who are actually responsible for driving forward \u0027Global Britain\u0027 want to see an outcome that avoids making trade with our biggest market more difficult, even if that takes longer to put in place.\u0026nbsp“They want to see the Prime Minister leading her Cabinet out at the end of this week with an agreed position, and then pushing on with negotiations with the EU.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The vote for Brexit was a cry for greater opportunity from those who feel that they and their children are mired in lives that offer little hope. \u0026nbspBrexit is a done deal, and the exact parameters of exit from the European Union will have limited and short-term bearing on the UK’s economic performance.The basic facts are uncontroversial. Britain will trade somewhat less than before, at least until British businesses redirect some of their trade away from the EU to more dynamic Asian and US economies.The expected decline in the extent of international trade will, for a while, reduce Britain’s overall economic welfare. But, as the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik has repeatedly emphasized, citizens’ economic welfare changes only modestly when countries with extensive trade relationships increase or decrease the extent of their international trade.Estimates of large (sometimes very large) costs of Brexit rely on the wildly unreasonable assumption that British productivity will decline precipitously and permanently.True, the UK\u0026nbsphas been growing slower than other advanced economies since the Brexit vote but that slower growth is almost entirely explained by senseless fiscal austerity being pursued by Prime Minister Theresa May’s government while other countries have neutral or even expansionary fiscal policy.There has been much handwringing about the depreciation of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote. Currency depreciation normally makes citizens poorer: they pay more for foreign products and receive reduced prices for their exports. But the UK was running a large (and growing) current account deficit.Put simply, the UK was not richer it was living beyond its means. Prolonged current account deficits would eventually have caused a sharper and, therefore, potentially more disruptive exchange rate depreciation. For now, the depreciation has helped narrow the deficit (precisely by making British exports less expensive for trading partners – stimulating demand for British goods – and making imports dearer for British consumers). Britain is on a more sustainable growth path.Moreover, as I noted at the time, the pound’s depreciation reflected an abrupt decline in “hot money flows” into the UK\u0026nbspThese foreign funds were being used by Russian oligarchs and Indian billionaires to bid up prices of property in London. After the Brexit decision, the rate of rise in London property price increases slowed markedly recently prices have actually dropped.Since the modest trade costs of Brexit are at least partially offset by favourable developments, it is crucial to recognise what is really at stake. The Brexit vote expressed the anxiety of those who felt that their prospects of rising up the income ladder were vanishing. In her October 2016 address to the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Theresa May seemed to understand that the vote was a plea for greater opportunity and fairness. But she seems to have lost track of that insight.As my student Rachel Lurie and I find in ongoing research, those who voted against Brexit were predominantly low-skilled workers stuck in dead-end jobs or unemployed in Britain’s rust-belt areas. As former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the days after the Brexit referendum, unable to face Asian competition, British manufacturing “collapsed,” and industrial towns “hollowed out,” leaving semi-skilled workers “on the wrong side of globalisation.”But rust-belt parents had a deeper reason to worry. They were bequeathing poor education and work opportunities to their children. Thus, not only were they themselves stuck, they also felt powerless to create more opportunities for their children and grandchildren.The children, for their part, are as dispirited as their parents. Commentators commonly point out that young British citizens voted more so than their elders to remain in the EU. This ignores the large numbers who did not vote: these were young citizens typically unemployed in socially dysfunctional urban communities.For example, in Greater London, the voter turnout was 79 percent in affluent Kingston upon Thames borough but only 65 percent in Hackney, where large pockets of deep poverty and alienation persist. The non-vote of the young living in bleak urban areas was as much a sign of hopelessness as the exit vote of older rust-belt citizens.Theresa May’s early reading was right: UK\u0026nbspcitizens were indeed pleading through their vote (and non-vote) for a fair shot at the future. They were urgently calling on British leaders to revitalize decaying industrial areas and bring hope to failing urban communities in which they were trapped.The message of the Brexit vote – and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since – was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitments.That crucial message has been lost amid the frenzied Brexit negotiations. Until it is heard, it will continue to haunt, and be repeated again and again.Ashoka Mody\u0026nbspis Visiting Professor of International Economic Policy at Princeton University and former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s European and Research Departments.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

blacklist communists information research department ird","story":"Created with Sketch.In 1949 the man who conceived Big Brother gave a semi-secret government department a list of 38 ‘crypto-communists’\u0026nbspand ‘fellow travellers’ –\u0026nbspa revelation that has given rise to a peculiar revisionism of his legacyClick to followThe Independent OnlineGeorge Orwell’s cooperation with the government’s Information Research Department has led to some on the hard left branding him a ‘reactionary snitch’To many, he came close to being a secular saint.George Orwell, born 115 years ago on Monday, was the writer who challenged the iniquities of imperialism and capitalism, who took a bullet in the throat fighting fascism, and who taught a Western audience about the horrors of Stalinist communism.That he died young, of tuberculosis at the age of 46, in 1950, served only to enhance his posthumous reputation.\u0026nbspHe became, in the words of one astute critic, “the James Dean of the Cold War,\u0026nbspthe John F\u0026nbspKennedy of English letters”.Death may also have saved him from curdling into the kind of bitter, contrarian conservatism that seems to have been the fate awaiting many a one-time youthful socialist.Instead, Orwell is often remembered as a man of “genius”, the “greatest political writer of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury”.The commonly accepted view of the man is encapsulated in the aims of the foundation bearing his name.\u0026nbspThrough the coveted Orwell Prize, the Orwell Foundation seeks “to celebrate honest writing and reporting, to uncover hidden lives, to confront uncomfortable truths, to promote Orwell’s values of integrity, decency and fidelity to truth”.And yet there is one blemish – or complication – in the reputation of St George.It lay hidden until 1996 when Foreign Office file FO 111189 was made public under the 30-year rule.The hitherto secret file revealed that in 1949 the great writer had, via his friend Celia Kirwan, given a semi-secret government propaganda unit called the Information Research Department\u0026nbsp(IRD) what became known as “Orwell’s List”.Orwell effectively handed over to the British authorities the names of 38 public figures whom he thought should be treated with suspicion as secret communists or “fellow travellers” who sympathised with the aims of Stalin’s Russia.When the existence of Orwell’s List was revealed in 1996, and when the Foreign Office finally ulged who was on it in 2003, the initial reactions seemed tinged with sadness and hedged about with qualifications.But the internet was young then.Now it has grown into a giant bristling with social media channels and anger\u0026nbspswift to judge, slow to reflect.And so George Orwell, a hero to so many, is now demonised online as a “fake socialist”, a “reactionary snitch”, a traitor, a McCarthyite “weasel”.“Orwell’s List is a term that should be known by anyone who claims to be a person of the left,” declares one fairly widely circulated condemnation.\u0026nbsp“At the end of his life, he was an outright counter-revolutionary snitch, spying on leftists on behalf of the imperialist British government.”“He was an anti-socialist,” asserts another indictment, “corresponding with British secret services and keeping a blacklist of writers.”So widespread has the vilification become,\u0026nbspthat “Orwell as snitch”\u0026nbspis sometimes played with – not entirely seriously – as an internet meme.“I can’t get very worked up about the list,” he says mildly.\u0026nbsp“I don’t see it particularly as a mistake. \u0026nbsp“You just have to see it in the context of the time.”And that context, reveals Taylor, was explained to him by the left wing former Labour leader Michael Foot.Taylor recalls: “Foot told me that the great difficulty if you were a left wing Labour MP in the 1940s was working out exactly where your friends stood.\u0026nbspYou didn’t know whether some were listening to you and agreeing, and then going straight to the British Communist Party’s headquarters in King Street and telling them everything.”“Another example of the kind of thing they were facing,” says Taylor, “was the man who worked in the Foreign Office in the room next to Orwell’s IRD friend Celia.\u0026nbspHis name was Guy Burgess.“There were at least a dozen elected parliamentarians taking their orders from a foreign country,” adds Taylor.\u0026nbsp“What could be more traitorous than that?”Years after Orwell listed him as giving the “strong impression of being some kind of Russian agent”, the Mitrokhin Archive of KGB documents revealed that journalist Peter Smollett had indeed been a Russian agent.Driberg, who was\u0026nbspnamed on Orwell’s List as well as the KGB papers (Getty)Also listed by Orwell, and as a KGB agent by Mitrokhin, was the leading Labour MP Tom Driberg.Laying aside the irony that Michael Foot was himself once falsely accused of being a KGB agent, it is, then, perhaps no coincidence that the IRD was in fact set up, not by a headbanging Tory, but by Labour foreign secretary Ernest Bevin.“This was at a time when the Soviet Union was swallowing up what had previously been independent East European states,” says Taylor. “The IRD was producing reasoned expositions, pamphlet literature, telling people on the ground in Eastern Europe why they should resist this kind of stuff. \u0026nbsp“But a lot of British people were still seduced by the idea of our ally ‘good old Uncle Joe Stalin’, when in fact the bloke was a mass murdering psychopath.\u0026nbspAnd you were also dealing with some really hardline ideologues.“So Orwell’s idea was, if you are going to get somebody to write these kinds of pamphlets, they have to be genuine democrats.“He was a democratic socialist who wanted democratic socialists, not right wingers, to be writing this propaganda.\u0026nbspBut he wanted them to be people who had seen through the Soviet illusion, not covert stooges for Stalin’s Russia.”And so Taylor’s anger – such as it is – is reserved, not for Orwell, but for those like the late Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, who greeted the revelation of the list with the “pathetic” remark: “Orwell was a Big Brother too”.“This wasn’t Orwell denouncing anybody,” says Taylor.\u0026nbsp“He wasn’t writing public articles in the press saying ‘these people are evil’.It should perhaps be noted that Celia Kirwan was a bit more than just a friend.\u0026nbspThree years earlier, Orwell had actually proposed marriage to her in the emotional turmoil that followed the death of his first wife Eileen.Kirwan rebuffed his advances, but some have suggested that Orwell, aware of his failing health, might have been seeking the comfort of a beautiful woman when\u0026nbspon 6 April 1949\u0026nbsphe wrote offering to name those who “should not be trusted as propagandists”. \u0026nbspHe certainly knew the list was not for Kirwan’s eyes only.\u0026nbspAs noted by Timothy Garton Ash, the historian who persuaded the Foreign Office to reveal the document in 2003, Orwell sent his list to Kirwan with a reference to “your friends” who would read it.And as Garton Ash also noted, the IRD did not confine itself to relatively innocuous pamphleteering.In the New York Review of Books article that formed the first detailed analysis of the list’s contents, Garton Ash wrote: “By the late 1950s, IRD had a reputation as ‘the dirty tricks department’ of the Foreign Office, indulging in character assassination, false telegrams, putting itching powder on lavatory seats\u0026nbspand other such Cold War pranks”.When he sent his list to Celia Kirwan in 1949, Orwell might not have known that this was the IRD’s direction of travel, but of all people, the author of 1984, who envisaged the Ministry of Truth, should surely have been aware of the possibility.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThat said, as Garton Ash also wrote, not much seemed to have happened to the people on Orwell’s List (apart from missing out on the IRD pamphlet-writing gig).\u0026nbspIt seems their names weren’t even passed to MI5 or MI6.In America, Hollywood actors blacklisted during the McCarthy era\u0026nbsphad their careers and lives ruined.\u0026nbspIn England, Michael Redgrave appeared on Orwell’s List in 1949 and starred in the film adaptation of Orwell’s novel 1984 seven years later.Peter Smollett, named by Orwell as a likely Russian agent, got an OBE.2017 isn’t ‘1984’ – it’s stranger than Orwell imaginedREAR WINDOW: COLD WAR:The British Ministry of PropagandaBig Brother with a high moral senseIn other words, what happened to those on Orwell’s List seems to have borne no comparison to the fate of Big Brother’s fictional victims or the real millions who died in the purges and repression ordered by Stalin.“The list invites us to reflect again on the asymmetry of our attitudes toward\u0026nbspNazism and communism,” wrote Garton Ash, whose own experiences of being spied on by the communist East German Stasi informed his book The File. \u0026nbspWhat if Orwell had given the government a list of closet Nazis, he wondered.\u0026nbsp“Would anyone be objecting?”And in truth, there does seem a certain asymmetry in the online articles of denunciation.Indeed it is hard not to sense the inspiration of Private Eye’s (fictional) veteran class warrior Dave Spart in some of the articles condemning Orwell as “a social democratic traitor collaborating with the capitalist state against revolutionaries trying to create socialism.”“Sure, the USSR did a lot of objectionable things,” says one writer.\u0026nbsp“But … Western imperialist countries commit much more heinous crimes throughout the world every day.”Which is one way to gloss over the Gulag.The 15 best opening lines in literature115 Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a

The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.A stronger charge against Orwell might be that of antisemitism.\u0026nbspThe private notebooks that formed the basis of the list he sent to the IRD included labels like “Polish Jew”, “English Jew”, and “Jewess”.But Orwell did also devote an entire 1945 essay to discussing how best to combat antisemitism, while having the honesty to admit – and regret – his own occasional lapses into jokes at the expense of Jews.And at the moment, antisemitism might be a problematic charge for some left wingers to level.Taylor, though, is convinced that some amongst “the newly emergent hard left” would secretly love to unleash something against Orwell.And yes, by “newly emergent hard left”, he does mean some Corbynistas.Younger party members, Taylor concedes, might not have the personal memories of the Cold War, still less an instinctive understanding of the context in which Orwell produced his list in 1949.But, he adds: “I am a Labour Party member.\u0026nbspI have been to hear Corbyn speak and noticed how an awful lot of the people there were aged left wingers for whom there had not really been a place in the Labour Party for the last 20 or 30 years.“An awful lot of the hard left these days would pay lip service to Orwell as a beacon of sanity, while secretly having doubts.“There are still a load of extreme lefties out there to whom Orwell is this snivelling little Trotskyite telling them things they don’t want to hear and pointing out things that shouldn’t be pointed out because they get in the way of the revolution.”And to the ideological, Taylor would add the psychological: “Tall poppy syndrome – Orwell is this secular saint, so let’s have a go at him.”This battle over Orwell’s reputation, of course, is more than just a matter of idle literary historical curiosity.Its relevance to the political struggles of today is suggested by the remark of one of the more ferocious online critics.“George Orwell,” he says, “was the first in a long line of Trots-turned-neocons”.It is certainly true that far-right commentators have started trying to co-opt Orwell to their cause, even to the point of suggesting that the man who once chased a fascist across a battlefield with a fixed bayonet would deplore the Antifa movement.This, says Taylor, is pretty much what Orwell feared.“At the time he was giving Celia Kirwan his list, 1984 was about to be published.\u0026nbspOrwell’s great fear was that right wingers would use it as a piece of anti-communist propaganda, and that’s what happened.\u0026nbspImmediately after\u0026nbsp1984 was published, it was used by the CIA as a propaganda tool.“Orwell wrote a very interesting letter to people in the US saying: ‘Look, this is not so much anti-communist as anti-totalitarian.’“He feared what right wingers would do with 1984, but thought it was the price you had to pay for exposing evils like totalitarianism.“And a writer can’t be blamed for how their books are used by people who are determined to twist meaning for malignant ends.”Taylor, though, can’t help wondering whether Orwell would really have been that upset by the comments of “slightly disconnected people” on the far left of the internet.Orwell himself, he points out, never sought secular saint status.\u0026nbspQuite the reverse: “He was very wary of that kind of thing.\u0026nbspIn an essay on Gandhi he effectively says that when people start being referred to as saints there is something very odd about them and it usually ends in disaster.”Instead Taylor has a sneaking suspicion that Orwell might have been rather amused by his online detractors.“People undervalue Orwell’s wry sense of humour,” he says.\u0026nbsp“David Astor, who used to edit the Observer and employed him, told me about the time Orwell came to him saying, ‘You should hear the abuse I have been getting from some of the communist newspapers.’“Orwell said: ‘They call me a fascist octopus.\u0026nbspThey call me a fascist hyena.“Then he paused: ‘They’re very fond of animals’.”\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We’ve done everything we could but no one seems to care.“It was a nightmare, the biggest you could imagine.”The couple booked their week-long holiday to the five star Atki Hotel on the island of Kos with First Choice and flew out on a TUI jet from Gatwick in June.Mr Mundy, from Portsmouth,\u0026nbspsaid: “It was the first holiday we had together.“We boarded the plane to go to Greece, it was very exciting. We sat to watch a film and chilled out on the plane to pass the time.”They put their passports in a transparent plastic bag and tucked them into the seat pockets for the duration of the four-hour flight.But within minutes of stepping off the plane they realised they didn’t have the documents and instantly tried to backtrack, but were told they couldn’t re-board.Instead a member of staff conducted a search but quickly emerged to say they could not be found.The couple pleaded with staff to have another look and gave detailed instructions about where the passports were, but still they could not be found.Ms Floyd, also from Portsmouth said: “I realised as soon as we got off the plane, it could only have been two minutes tops.“They told us we couldn’t get back on the plane and the made us wait by the door to the airport while someone went to look but they said there was nothing there.”Their surprise turned to horror when they were told they would not be allowed into Greece and would have to return to the UK.UK weather: Temperatures soar as heatwave intensifiesPeople relax in the warm weather on the beach in BrightonPeople enjoying the hot weather and sunshine on the banks of the River Thames in PutneySpectators enjoy the hot weather during day seven of the Nature Valley International at Devonshire ParkHot and sunny day in Hyde Park\u0027s Serpentine lakePeople relax in the warm weather on the beach in EastbournePeople sunbathe as they enjoy the warm weather on Bournemouth beachA person sunbathes on a blow up mattress in the sea off of Bournemouth beach in DorsetA couple relax in the sunshine on the beach in BrightonPeople play in water fountains in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east LondoChris Bryant from Basingstoke paddle boards at Boscombe Beach in DorsetPeople shelter from the sun beneath umbrellas as they walk in St James\u0027s Park in LondonArianna Espiritu Kelly, 2, eats an ice-cream in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park Victor the Polar Bear enjoys a dip in the water at Yorkshire Wildlife Park People on the beach in BrightonWoman relax in the sunshine on the beach in Hastings, SussexPeople enjoy their lunch break in the sunshine near Tower Bridge in LondonPolice horses drink from a water fountain during the hot weather in Green ParkAnglers fish on New Brighton beach on the Wirral, Merseyside as the sun rises over the Port of Liverpool and the River MerseyA family of lemurs enjoy an ice lolly at Yorkshire Wildlife Park People enjoy the sunshine in St James\u0027s Park in in LondonA duck swims in the algae covered lake in St James\u0027s Park, LondonA couple cycle in the sunshine around Bewl Water in KentA man takes a break in the sun on Southbank, LondonPeople relax in the warm weather on the beach in BrightonPeople enjoying the hot weather and sunshine on the banks of the River Thames in PutneySpectators enjoy the hot weather during day seven of the Nature Valley International at Devonshire ParkHot and sunny day in Hyde Park\u0027s Serpentine lakePeople relax in the warm weather on the beach in EastbournePeople sunbathe as they enjoy the warm weather on Bournemouth beachA person sunbathes on a blow up mattress in the sea off of Bournemouth beach in DorsetA couple relax in the sunshine on the beach in BrightonPeople play in water fountains in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east LondoChris Bryant from Basingstoke paddle boards at Boscombe Beach in DorsetPeople shelter from the sun beneath umbrellas as they walk in St James\u0027s Park in LondonArianna Espiritu Kelly, 2, eats an ice-cream in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park Victor the Polar Bear enjoys a dip in the water at Yorkshire Wildlife Park People on the beach in BrightonWoman relax in the sunshine on the beach in Hastings, SussexPeople enjoy their lunch break in the sunshine near Tower Bridge in LondonPolice horses drink from a water fountain during the hot weather in Green ParkAnglers fish on New Brighton beach on the Wirral, Merseyside as the sun rises over the Port of Liverpool and the River MerseyA family of lemurs enjoy an ice lolly at Yorkshire Wildlife Park People enjoy the sunshine in St James\u0027s Park in in LondonA duck swims in the algae covered lake in St James\u0027s Park, LondonA couple cycle in the sunshine around Bewl Water in KentA man takes a break in the sun on Southbank, LondonShe added: “We had people around us making sure we didn’t leave.“We were waiting for about 30 minutes for a flight back, we had to wait by the door.

Heres the truth about what youre actually entitled to.Employees are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) if you have started work for an employer, are sick for four days straight and earn £113 a week.You are not eligible if you are self-employed, have had SSP for 28 weeks, serve in the armed forces or are in legal custody - to name a few.If you meet the criteria, you can get £89.35 per week for up to 28 weeks but your employer may choose to pay you more.If you haven’t been given a contract or it’s not in there, you should ask your employer or check your staff handbook or intranet.A survey from Direct Line found 96 per cent of British workers do not know how much sick pay they are entitled to, the Mirror reported.It went on to say that more than 40 per cent of companies reduce salaries to SSP within two weeks.And one in six firms are reported to slash wages after just four days.Its important for people to be able to quickly secure sick notes or medical certificates when they’re unwell, said Direct Line head of life insurance Trevor Bush.Unfortunately yes, and Citizens Advice warned some businesses are exploiting confusion around the issue to avoid paying employees.It claims firms use tactics including cancelling shifts after staff have called in sick to appear as though they were not meant to be in that day.Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice told Sun Online: Sick pay is a basic right which many workers are entitled to.Although some employers make genuine mistakes... others are trying to confuse people about their rights so they can get away with not paying up.If your boss says that you arent entitled to sick pay but you feel you are, ask them to fill in the government sick pay form explaining their reasons.Once theyve handed it back to you, contact HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) on 0300 200 3200. The taxman will make a decision about whether you are owed sick pay or not.If your employer still refuses to pay, contact the Acas by filling in the early conciliation form (or calling them on 0300 123 1122) and they will negotiate with your employer.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last October, this column urged Mrs May to get the Cabinet to Chequers and not let them leave until they had agreed on the final deal with the EU they should be aiming for.This delay in setting out what the UK wants is one of the many mistakes that have handed the initiative in these negotiations to the EU.In an attempt to prevent any walkouts at Chequers, the Prime Minister will spend the next few days seeing senior ministers individually. “She’s peeling off people one by one,” I’m told.But I understand there has still not yet been a “model that has been selected to go forward for adjudication by the Cabinet”. I am told the approach at the meeting will be “to rule things out rather than rule things in”.Cabinet Brexiteers, though, are already nervous about getting bounced — of being presented with a done deal they will have to either accept or resign over.One of those co-ordinating the Brexiteer response tells me: “She’ll have to show her hand before Chequers. The idea of bouncing people with papers they haven’t seen is completely unrealistic as to where we are.It might have been possible six months ago, it is not possible now.”Brexiteers are worried about Downing Street’s direction of travel.One tells me: “They’re prepared to give away things, but they don’t understand what they are giving away.”The expectation is that the Government will essentially propose staying in the single market for goods.But what won’t be addressed is what this means for immigration.The EU will — at least initially — demand free movement in exchange for the UK staying in the single market for goods.I understand the current plan is for the white paper to say the UK acknowledges that labour mobility deals normally go alongside trade deals. But there won’t be much more detail than that.Sajid Javid, the new Home Secretary, takes the view that the Government shouldn’t put immigration on the table in these talks until it knows what it wants.He is also of the view that if the EU want a deal on immigration then they should have to ask for it.As a former banker, with experience of commercial negotiations, he — unlike too many people in the Government machine — understands the difference between bid and offer.Among Cabinet ministers there is a growing view that they will all be back at Chequers in September to discuss how much they are prepared to move on immigration.But any attempt to get the UK to allow any EU citizen with a job to come here will encounter resistance.“If you can come if you have a job, that’s basically free movement,” one ally of Brexit Secretary David Davis tells me.Getting the Cabinet to agree at Chequers, though, is only the first challenge for Mrs May.The next — and even more difficult one — is to get the EU to engage with what she is proposing. CONCERNS are mounting in Whitehall about the Nato summit, and what Donald Trump might say and do.Compounding the issue is that Trump will go straight from the summit to a dinner in Britain to mark the start of his visit here – meaning Theresa May won’t be able to avoid having to say what she thinks of his comments.One well-placed Government source insists to me that the Trump/May relationship is better than it is portrayed.But this source admits his telephone manner can be rather surprising.I am told that, in reference to Brexit, he regularly starts their conversations with: “Are you out yet?Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake. That the West’s security has relied on Nato for 70 years.And that it would be a disaster for the President to undermine it now, with Russia an increasing global menace.THE restoration work at the House of Commons has hit a snag.Some of the oil paintings, which need to be moved, are too big to go through the doors of the rooms they are in.This means that the oil will need to be rehydrated, a complex process, before the canvases are rolled up so they can be moved.This is another reminder of how difficult it will be to do these restoration works without going way over budget. MICHAEL GOVE has ripped up Theresa May’s plan for a new customs partnership with the EU.To the surprise of officials present, Gove tore the document in two at a meeting on Wednesday.After the Brexit inner Cabinet couldn’t reach a consensus on what customs relationship to have with the EU after Brexit, it was split into working groups to look at the two options.Gove was looking at the new customs partnership, which is Theresa May’s preferred model and would see the UK collecting tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Nearly all Brexiteers, including Gove, see this model as bureaucratic, unworkable and fear it will make Britain a far less attractive country to do a trade deal with.Gove and Liam Fox, the two Brexiteers on the three-man working group, had made these points repeatedly in the six weeks of meetings they have had on the subject.But on Wednesday night, when they were presented with the civil service summary of their discussions, they found these points had been downplayed to almost nothing.Instead, the document implied the group thought the new customs partnership was workable.Gove was livid about this and physically ripped it up to show he wasn’t prepared to accept the document as a summary of their discussions.This flash of anger shows that Downing Street would be making a very big mistake if it assumed Gove will accept – and sell to fellow Brexiteers – any deal with the EU, no matter how flawed it is and how much it tied the UK’s hands for the future.Customs will be one of the biggest bones of contention at Chequers.I understand there is talk the model favoured by Brexiteers MaxFax might be altered to include tariff alignment with the EU.But if that’s the case, then Britain WON’T be able to have a proper, independent trade policy.One of the Brexiteers close to the discussions warns this is the “breaking point of what people are prepared to accept”. THERESA MAY is making it clear to everyone in government that she intends to stay on as Prime Minister after Brexit day, March 30, 2019.Yesterday afternoon, Downing Street summoned the Government’s political advisers and told them to start working on measures to be included in the next Queen’s Speech, to take place in spring and after Brexit day.A Downing Street source tells me: “As you would expect, the Government is focusing on a comprehensive programme of domestic legislation for the next session of Parliament.This will include new plans for the country’s future outside the European Union.”This Queen’s Speech will be huge for Mrs May.It will be her last best chance to show her party she has a domestic agenda that justifies her staying on as Prime Minister.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To which the EU’s Michel Barnier will inevitably reply: “No. It’s full single market membership, including free movement of migrants, or nothing.”Then what? What else has No10 got?There are red lines Theresa May must not cross: free movement, independent trade deals, our courts’ supremacy. She won’t survive conceding on any of them.We weep for Downing Street’s tactics.They seem ­terrified that the PM might have to walk out of talks. Why? If the EU continues to demand everything on its terms, she must do exactly that.They’ll call back.GOBBY Irish PM Leo Varadkar has no idea how much damage he does with every Brexit utterance.His latest salvo revealed a patronising, pompous arrogance as misplaced as it was sickening.The mighty EU won’t change its rules for little Britain, Varadkar sneered.“We’re 27 member states — the UK is one country,” he said. “We’re 500million people, the UK is 60million. That basic fact has to be understood.”The Sun has some more basic facts:Ireland’s population is 4.8million. The UK’s is 66.5million.Ireland’s economy relies on us so heavily that a “no deal” is forecast to throw 2.5 per cent of its workforce on the dole. It is far more exposed than any other EU country, or the UK.Our billions bailed out broke Ireland in 2010. Has Varadkar forgotten?Is he happy to sour relations with millions of UK customers with long memories, who may take against Irish goods?A wiser man would have acted as peacemaker, constructively helping both sides forge a historic deal in all our interests, including those of his country and its wonderful people.Instead he chose another role . . . as the snivelling suck-up egging on the playground bullies.THERESA May must seize her crucial opportunity to save Nato next month.Donald Trump is rightly berating Europe’s major powers for failing, unlike Britain, to fund their defence. But Nato is not some unfavourable trade deal he can abandon at a stroke.Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake.

They must also achieve an outcome which allows the UK to take back full control over our laws, our borders and our money.Any wavering or compromise that keeps Britain as a cash cow for Europe, and our people and businesses subjugated to EU laws that hurt our interests, would be a spectacular own goal.Instead of pandering to those who want to keep Britain in the EU, the Single Market and Customs Union, the team at Chequers must now stand firm and not back down.Their strategy and game plan must be to stand up to the EU and stop letting their negotiating team walk all over us.So far we have been negotiating with the EU in good faith and we have conceded too much ground for little in return.We have pledged a divorce settlement totalling £40billion and while we have advanced a package to ensure that the rights of EU citizens currently in the UK are protected, the rest of the EU have made alarmingly little progress on protecting the rights of British citizens living elsewhere in the EU.Conceding further ground to the EU now will leave Britain exposed at the back and will let the greedy undemocratic EU leaders take advantage of our open goal.The country also decided to take Britain on a new path to future prosperity.Outside of the EU the world is growing at a fast pace.Expanding consumer markets present new opportunities for exciting trade and investment partnerships. Technological change and innovation happens worldwide and the EU’s place in the global economy is falling fast.Ministers must not allow Britain to slip in the world trade league by being chained in any way to Brussels as the EU sinks.Without the straitjacket of EU rules Britain will stand out as a strong place for businesses to invest.While an out-of-touch elite who want to keep Britain in the EU continue to spread fear and doom and gloom, in the real world our economy is doing well.We have some great foundations and since the referendum Britain has seen a surge in foreign direct investment to record levels which shows the high degree of confidence investors have in Britain.They see that outside of the EU Britain will be successful and everyone in the Cabinet should stop playing defensively and commit to that vision too.We are at a crucial moment in our history and Cabinet members need to understand the magnitude of the decisions   they are making.Now is not the time for grandstanding or for egos to get in the way. Ministers need to tighten ranks and play as a united team to achieve victory.The future of our country is far too important to leave to chance and if the Cabinet gets its act together this week then we will be in control of our own destiny.In years to come, people will look back at the decisions we make today and judge members of this Government on whether they have advanced the cause of freedom, prosperity and democracy with a well-executed match- winning plan . . . or left our country to the fate and uncertainty of a penalty shoot-out.Priti Patel is a Conservative MP, representing  Witham in Essex. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Way better, in fact, without wanting to sling mud, than many other commentators who — regardless of their gender — can barely string two words together.Because, of course, whether or not you are good at your job has got absolutely nothing to do with your gender, right?Until, that is, you are a woman in football, or some other realm that men consider belongs to them.Then, it turns out, it’s a problem. For some men at least.Just to be clear, the idea that football is a “guy thing” is totally outdated. More women watch football in the UK than watch EastEnders (and that’s when there isn’t a World Cup on).And that’s just watching it. I’ll get on to playing it in a minute.Still, Simon Kelner, the former editor of the Independent, wrote in a column this week that women talking about World Cup games “is like getting a netball player to discuss major league basketball”.Then former player Jason Cundy gave his five cents worth, saying that women are unsuited to commentate on football matches because “their voices are too high”.And — although I had to watch it from behind a cushion because I was cringing so much — former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra gave Eni Aluko an actual round of applause for her analysis of one match. . . because he was so surprised that women, you know, know stuff about football too.(Her face when he did so was priceless: Withering look personified.)In case you didn’t know, Eni Aluko has more than 100 caps for England as a player. She also has a first-class degree in law. She is super brainy, bright and articulate — and she knows an awful lot about football.I am full of admiration for her. She is such a strong woman. She is also more than qualified to comment on a football match.Sadly, “more than qualified” is often what women need to be to get ahead in a male world.Eni Aluko is a high-powered lawyer, a professional sportswoman who adds serious value to the commentary of any match.Patrice Evra must know her credentials. But some men, when they feel threatened by a woman, respond by patronising her. They try to put her down. Diminish her. Banish her back into her box.As a woman working in sport I am familiar with this.Lots of men who think women in football are encroaching on “their” territory do the same to me. The number of suggestions I’ve had to get back in the kitchen — and far worse — are too many to count.It doesn’t bother me. But it is tedious and annoying.Men who respond to women in this way can’t quite accept that a new generation of women are coming to the fore and using their voice.They really can’t get their heads around the changes that are happening so quickly — the emergence of women who are using their voice, taking “their” jobs.Luckily, they are a dying breed, these men who want to keep women in the Victorian ages.Plus, it is beginning to dawn on them that we aren’t going back into the box.And they’d better get used to it because it’s not just women commentating on football who are being taken more seriously. It’s women who are playing it too.I’m proud and excited to say that West Ham is one of 11 clubs with new Women’s Super League licences.This really is going to change the face of women’s football.Tier one, the Women’s Super League, starts next year and West Ham is part of that.And the Super League is going to mean a lot more money, professionalism and structure for women in football.So to anyone who is worried about female match commentators all I can say is: Hold on to your hats, boys.REBEKAH Vardy got slammed this week for speaking out about being in Russia.She said that she took the role of supporting her husband – and being there for him before a match – very seriously, saying: “I would be mortified if I was pictured leaving a bar absolutely p***ed, knowing that my husband was going to play one of the biggest games of his life the next day.”Of course, some wasted no time laying into Rebekah’s version of feminism since it included being present for her husband which – according to comments I read – undermines feminist values.I have to say I really disagree.Whoever said that you can’t be a feminist and also stand by your man?I LOVED reading about Christine Lampard, who is pregnant, saying she, “couldn’t care less” about putting on weight as long as everything’s OK inside.In an age when many pregnant women barely look like they are expecting, only to “snap back into shape” within days of giving birth, that’s such a refreshing attitude. I felt the same way and allowed myself to eat what I wanted.I know some women crave chalk and coal when they are pregnant but my craving was for Wagon Wheels.At one point I was on about 12 a day. Those were the days.JOOLS Oliver says that being a stay-at-home mum is ten times harder than Jamie’s job running a multi-million-pound cooking empire.She described her role as “brain numbing” and “hell on earth” and said no one respects her in the household. I’m sure lots of eyes will roll at that idea, but I have to say that I agree.The brief run-in I had with being a stay-at-home mum left me full of nothing but admiration and respect for those women who do it on a daily basis.And it made going back to work feel like a walk in the park.LET’S congratulate New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, for being only the second woman ever to give birth while in such senior office.Some people have questioned whether Jacinda can do the job as a new parent. Would that same question ever be asked of a man?WELL this is exciting. Scientists are apparently closer than ever to inventing an invisibility cloak.I’m sure it’s intended for use by top secret agents intent on saving the world.But all I can think about is what a great accessory it would be for any party at which there are people you don’t fancy talking to.Or for eavesdropping on Apprentice candidates.Or spying on the half-time huddle of any team West Ham is playing.In fact, the possibilities are endless.HONESTLY there is no pleasing some people. The number of moans I have heard this week about people who think it is too hot.Just cast your mind back to the past couple of years when it rained solidly for most of June and July – and count your lucky stars.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not Piers, who went on to issue a further challenge: “On Thursday night, you can watch England destroy Belgium, then watch me destroy Love Island straight after.”So I did. No further comment is needed on the first bit of Piers’ equation. But, hell on TV earth, I can’t ignore the second.A “one-off special” called Good Evening Britain which attempted to cash in on the breakfast magic and must have seemed like a great idea until England v Belgium became a loser-takes-all non-event, the wardrobe department shoved Susanna Reid into a Spanish Flamenco dancer’s outfit and someone lost control of the guest list.’Cos all of the pre-publicity for this one assured me there’d be just three present: Danny Dyer, the Labour Party leader and a slightly spooked Pamela Anderson, who set the first alarm ringing by claiming: “When they told me Jeremy Corbyn’s going to be here I thought this was going to be a serious political ­programme.”Why the hell a dissembling old fool like Corbyn would make anyone think that is a bit of a mystery, but ­serious was the last word you’d use to describe Good Evening Britain.They weren’t alone either. The joint was jumping, in fact, with David Ginola, Amir Khan, Ed Balls, Tory MP James Cleverly, Harry Redknapp, BGT comic Daliso Chaponda and live feeds from a reporter in Russia and Andi Peters at Emmerdale’s Woolpack pub.As GEB quickly demonstrated, of course, the reason chat shows don’t invite nine guests to appear is that you instantly have nine chaotic voices clamouring for attention and often talking at cross-purposes.All it then takes is one guest to throw a spanner in the works and the whole vibe collapses, as it duly did when Piers and Susanna started asking Pammie about her French footballer boyfriend, Adil Rami, who she claimed was “doing really well”.Susanna: “He’s not played yet.” I haven’t been watching, I’ve been looking after my father who’s just had a stroke.” When someone drops a bombshell like that, clearly, you need to steer the conversation away pretty sharpish which, in fairness, Piers did by asking Amir Khan: “Do you have a sex ban before fights?”Only with his wife, I’d imagine, Piers, but thanks for asking. It set the perfectly awkward tone for the entire evening. For GEB to be classed as a true TV disaster, though, it still needed three other things to happen.The first were technical glitches, which duly arrived when the satellite link to a bunch of drunk England fans went down. The second was Andi Peters referring to Emmerdale as “Coronation Street”. Check.The third and most important, however, was for one of the guests to get a bit sweary and lairy. Enter Danny Dyer who ensured GEB will enter TV folklore, when he launched into Brexit, asking: “What’s happened to that t**t David Cameron? He’s in Nice with his trotters up. He should be held to account for it . . . t**t.”The far more pertinent bit of his ­contribution, though, was the moment he addressed the host: “Just stop talking, Piers. Just talkin’ talkin’, ramblin’ on.”Breakfast TV would be a hopelessly dull, molly-coddling chore again without Piers’ ego and all his boastful predictions, which just for the record, ended with the following score, on Thursday.Good Evening Britain — 2.91million viewers. Love Island — 3.2million. Boom.Martin Keown: “When you play in midfield you’ve got to have legs.”Guy Mowbray: “We haven’t seen anything of Di Maria in Argentina’s first three games. Although he only played in two of them.”Alan Shearer: “Portugal were very much like Portugal.”And Lee Dixon: “We’ve had five balls that have gone flat. Three times that’s happened.”(Compiled by Graham Wray).WHATEVER our differences elsewhere, I hope there’s one thing on which we’re all agreed.The greatest quiz show in television history is Bullseye.An opinion confirmed when I tapped those magic eight letters into my Sky Planner’s search engine last week, and its back catalogue unfurled before me, including episode one of series one, which, for a TV critic, is like finding the source of the Nile.I don’t expect you to watch every episode, obviously, but if you have time for one, make it episode eight of series two.

Or B) the NHS needs a s***load more money.As righteous as it might make them all feel, however, deep down they know it makes for wretchedly dull television.Hence the presence, on this one, of Britain’s Got Talent winner Lost Voice Guy, who not even the resuscitation unit could help with gags like: “Laughter is the best medicine.

Brexiteers had feared that the PM would trade away the power – a key pledge by Leave campaigners – in exchange for a better trade deal.But the firm commitment for quotas to become a sovereign decision means only British ministers will decide who fishes in the 200 miles of our territorial waters, and how much they catch.No10 hopes the Brexit ‘red meat’ offer will calm a spiralling new rebellion among anti-EU Tories over Mrs May’s feared new red line climb downs on customs and Brussels rules on goods.Mrs May said: “As an island nation, our fishing industry is the lifeblood of coastal communities around the UK.“I have been clear that when we leave the EU we will take back control of our waters, while ensuring we don’t see our fishermen unfairly denied access to other waters. The plans set out today demonstrate the bright future in store as we build UK fishing industry for future generations by putting the importance of a healthy marine environment at its heart.”Environment Secretary Michael Gove will publish the plan in the Fisheries White Paper today.Mr Gove added: ““We will be able to put in place our own systems, becoming a world leader in managing our resources while protecting the marine environment”.Fishermen’s groups were delighted with the blueprint.National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisation CEO Barrie Deas dubbed the plan “clear and cogent”. He added: “I am sure that it will attract wide support across the industry and Parliament.“Outside the EU, the UK will be an independent coastal state and this will provide the basis to rebalance quota shares and implement effective and adaptive management measures for our fisheries.”Non-UK vessels currently take more than 50% of British fishing stocks, in a set up they have attacked as deeply unfair for years. EU Member States currently land around eight times as much fish in UK waters than the UK does in EU Member States’ waters.Under the plan, foreign vessels will be allowed some fishing in British waters, but only in exchange for access to their nation’s. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But they do.Remarkably, one in 20 British nurseries is banning superhero costumes because they believe these colourful outfits are making our children aggressive.This attempted taming of tots doesn’t stop there though.Four in five nurseries won’t allow any weapons — whether they are plastic pirate ­cutlasses or harmless pop guns.This is totally wrong.When I was with my mates on the school yard or messing about on building sites I ­pretended to be Superman or ­a soldier, replaying what I had seen in John Wayne war films.These games teach you vital lessons that you will carry on into later life, like I did with the military.There is kinship, holding your own and negotiating with the kid who is getting a bit rowdy.I learned right and wrong, how to ­interact with others and when I was ­stepping out of line.But it didn’t make me think: “I want to join the Army and kill everyone.” ­Everyone plays those games, and some become accountants.I certainly allowed my daughter to play “fighting” and there is no evidence such activities make people more violent.When kids get out their toy swords or bows there is laughter and joy.This is about the normal competitive urge. Whether it’s sport, watching The X Factor or wishing to be top in your class, there is a desire to win.It is wrong to pretend ­otherwise, because when these kids enter the real world of work they will face a very ­competitive atmosphere.If you don’t fight to get to the top, you will go under.We can’t all be soft and cuddly. ­Societies need people with different talents and attitudes.There is a clear antipathy towards the armed services as a career in these ­nursery bans.Britain is struggling to find new recruits at the moment, and the last thing we need is children growing up believing this is a bad choice.Being a soldier, sailor or part of the RAF are valid ­professions. We need these real-life superheroes.My daughter considered ­joining the Armed Forces. She looked into the idea of a ­military scholarship when she was 18.I was all for that, but in the end she decided upon ­something else.There is an idea that these games are just for boys, but girls want to be involved as well.Warfare is part of our genetic make up.It has been like this since the time of hunter-gatherers who had to defend their food sources — first their hunting grounds then later, when we became farmers, our lands.The reason we have been so successful as a species is the ability to defend ­ourselves.Back in medieval times kids would play with wooden swords and it was once ­obligatory for all males aged over 14 to practise the longbow on Sundays.We all go “ahhh” when we see puppies or kittens tussling and rolling about with their siblings, but what they are doing is learning to defend themselves.The idea that stopping any gameplay which involves ­fighting is going to change hundreds of thousands of years of human development is ­nonsensical.The complaint that toy weapons fuel a chaotic atmosphere in our nurseries is nothing more than a sign of laziness among the employers and employees.They are taking the easy route by simply banning lively games. This is more about making life easier for the staff than it is about helping our kids. They just want the ­children sitting there passively, possibly watching television or playing on a tablet.That is not what young ­children are about. They have a huge amount of energy to burn, and it is wrong to corral them into increasingly sedate life-styles.We have enough problems with obesity without demanding the next generation sit quietly all day long.The truth is that children will use up calories when they run around pretending to be in Star Wars or The Incredibles.The staff shouldn’t be bringing their own political ideas into the playground. They shouldn’t be making the children conform to what they think. Instead they should be focusing on ­fostering the imaginations of children by allowing them to explore these ideas.Steve Jobs, who helped to bring the iPhone and the iPad to the world, was inspired by Star Trek, and there were quite a few people getting zapped on that.By allowing children to play cops and robbers or pirates or cowboys or superheroes they are developing storytelling skills which will be vital in their ­education.Do we want them to come to read ­William Shakespeare with no prior ­knowledge of what conflict is?Any writer will tell you great storytelling needs drama and to have drama you need conflict.Going back as far as Greek literature there was greed, envy and jealousy underpinning the narrative. These nurseries fail to recognise the quality of the gameplay generated by young minds.They should be harnessing the roleplay and getting involved. The staff could ask why one person is always the baddie and what the kids enjoy about being the goodie.Superhero movies always contain a ­positive moral tale that children can learn from. There is good, there is evil, there is a recognition that someone has acted wrongly and they explore ways to improve our behaviour.When kids play cops and robbers, it is the police who win.The baddie always gets their comeuppance and the cops are the smarter ones.It’s not about arming our children with guns, it’s about arming them with the tools they need to be more creative.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the payments if youre part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £348 if youre single, £464 if youre part of a couple or £812 if you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, even if you stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Payments if your payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.The report said that a fifth of claimants payments are delayed, it costs more to run, is taking six years longer than planned to roll out, and is driving people to food banks.But the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions claimed that Universal Credit IS working.In a statement in the Commons in response to the report she dismissed the study, and said it was a unique example of great British innovation.Former Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan-Smith announced the introduction of a Universal Credit in 2010 designed to simplify the benefits system and improve work incentives - making it the landmark policy of his time in government.He backed his successor last week, saying the NAO report was a shoddy piece of work.The Department for Work and Pensions has been approached for comment.But the upfront payment is a loan which means youll have to pay it back.The repayments will be automatically deducted from your Universal Credit payments after youve taken the loan.You should ask for the advance if you dont think youll have enough money to live on between when you apply and when youll get your first payment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Vote Leave has itself gone public with the dramatic finding after a long-running investigation by the Electoral Commission. Ex-Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott admitted: Their initial conclusion is that we have overspent, that a donation we made to another group during the course of the campaign was incorrect, we shouldn\u0027t have made that donation. But he denied wrongdoing, accused the watchdog of not following due process by ignoring one side of the story and vowed to challenge it in the courts. According to the BBC, the Commission\u0027s probe - which is not yet finalised - will accuse Vote Leave of four charges of breaking electoral law.  It is a breach of electoral law if a campaign both exceeds spending limits and knew or ought reasonably to have known that it would do so. Any breach of the law, if confirmed, could lead to a fine and fresh accusations that the 2016 EU referendum was won unfairly. Vote Leave was the official \u0027out\u0027 campaign in the referendum - so was allowed to spend a maximum of \u0026pound7million persuading voters. But it has faced two years of questions after handing more than \u0026pound600,000 to a 23-year-old fashion student, to spend on advertising, just days before the vote. Today, the BBC reports that the Commission is due to find Vote Leave co-ordinated with the fashion student and exceeded its spending limit.  The BBC made its claim after speaking to Mr Elliott, who has seen the draft findings and submitted a 500-page rebuttal to the Commission. Mr Elliott said: I believe we acted both within the letter of the law and also the spirit of the law and the spirit of how you should conduct a campaign. The Commission had already carried out two assessments last year and took no action. But fresh claims about the group\u0027s spending emerged from whistleblowers Christopher Wylie and Shahmir Sanni.  Mr Wylie worked for Cambridge Analytica, the data firm at the centre of the Facebook privacy scandal, while Mr Sanni worked with Vote Leave. Mr Elliott told Sky News: (The EC) listened to these, quite frankly marginal characters who came out in March, and listened to their stories, but haven\u0027t had evidence from Vote Leave side of things. I think it is a huge breach of natural justice that they haven\u0027t wanted to listen to our opinions and our story and we were the people running the campaign. An Electoral Commission spokeswoman told the Mirror: The Commission has concluded its investigation and having reached initial findings provided Vote Leave with a 28 day period to make any further or new representations. That period ended on Tuesday 3 July.

Guests paid up to \u0026pound1,500 a head for the annual Summer Party, held on Monday at London’s exclusive Hurlingham Club and hosted by PM Theresa May. As her Cabinet teetered on the edge of implosion over Brexit, desperate ministers had to rattle the Tory donation tin. Boris Johnson, David Davis, Michael Gove, Liz Truss and Gavin Williamson were seen “working the room”, getting rich supporters to part with their cash. Scroll down to see the items up for auction  But Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: “Rather than swanning about at fancy dinners, ministers should be hard at work fixing the mess they are making of Brexit, the crisis they have created in our public services and the falling living standards of people across the country.” Anger among Remain-backing City donors has made this year’s fundraiser all the more crucial for Mrs May. Contributions from the party’s biggest hedge fund backers have collapsed as they fear she is “botching” Brexit. One Conservative donor reportedly said yesterday: “A group of us were at the Tory bash last night. We were all asking why we fund this sh**show.”   Speaking at the event, Mrs May pleaded with her party to “stand together”. She said: “The stakes are high - perhaps higher than we have ever known in our political lifetimes. We each have a choice to make. Will we come together and stand together as a party, as a government and as a country? “Or will we be divided, and allow the scale of the challenge, the complexity of the questions to overwhelm us?” Desperate Tories pulled out all the stops to appease disillusioned backers during the event, with guests dining on smoked trout and beef fillet. And I’m A Celebrity winner Georgia Toffolo posed for selfies with activists and ministers.    MPs and guests at the Conservatives’ Summer Party were served a starter of Oak smoked trout, semi dried tomatoes, avocado cream, shallot and lemon oil dressing. The main course was Scottish beef fillet, mini cottage pie, creamed spinach and oyster mushrooms. A ‘mix of desserts’ was served to finish the meal. The meal was accompanied by a choice of a 2015 Mas Rabell white wine, from Torres in Catalonie and a 2015 Montes Classic Series Merlot from Chile’s Colchagua Valley. Both wines retail for around \u0026pound10 a bottle.  The fundraiser was held at the Hurlingham Club, a Georgian private sports and social club set in 42 acres of grounds along the Thames in Fulham, West London. Originally a gun club which boasted King Edward VII as an early patron, it is also famous for having published the original rules of polo. The Duchess of Cambridge and her sister Pippa Middleton regularly play tennis on the club’s , and Prince Philip is the current patron. There is currently a thirty-year waiting list for membership, and new joiners must be proposed and seconded by two current full club members.

The sale’s brochure boasted the posh MP would also serve a “home-cooked meal”. Labour MP John Mann said: Rees-Mogg can only afford a Bentley through his second job. He should have it embossed with the logo ‘paid for whilst moonlighting’. My raffle prizes are being donated by retired miners, cleaners and textile workers. The price may differ, but the value is greater.

The Work and Pensions Secretary has been thrown into an extraordinary public spat with the National Audit Office after she disowned its report on Universal Credit. Ms McVey claimed the damning NAO study, which found the flagship six-in-one benefit has not delivered value for money and threw claimants into hardship, was out of date. But today Auditor General Sir Amyas Morse took the rare step of writing an open letter to clarify the facts. He accused the Cabinet minister of misrepresenting his report, branded her behaviour odd and suggested she has refused to meet him. Crucially, he added her claim that Universal Credit is working has not been proven. Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said: Things have reached a new low when the National Audit Office accuses a Cabinet Minister of lying.  Universal Credit is failing, and if Esther McVey is not up to the job of sorting it out – as seems to be the case – then she has to go. A spokesman for Labour\u0027s whips said: If Esther McVey knowingly misled parliament, the ministerial code is very clear that she “will be expected to offer [her] resignation to the Prime Minister”. Suggesting her own civil servants disagree with her, Sir Amyas wrote to Ms McVey: Our report was fully agreed with senior officials in your department. It is based in the most accurate and up-to-date information from your department. Your department confirmed this to me in writing on 6 June and we then reached final agreement on the report by 8 June. It is odd that by 15 June you you felt able to say the NAO \u0027did not take into account the impact of our recent changes\u0027. You reiterated these statements on 2 July but we have seen no evidence of such impacts nor fresh information.   I\u0027m afraid your statement that the NAO was concerned Universal Credit is currently \u0027rolling out too slowly\u0027 and needs to \u0027continue at a faster rate\u0027 is also not correct. Sir Amyas, head of the NAO, also raised the fact Ms McVey has still not met with him more than a week after he tried to make an appointment.  And he warned the DWP\u0027s own surveys showed 40% of claimants were experiencing financial difficulties. He wrote: I\u0027m also afraid that your statement... claiming Universal Credit is working has not been proven. The department has not measured how many Universal Credit claimants are having difficulties and hardship. We also know that 20% of claimants are not paid in full on time and that the department cannot measure the exact number of additional people in employment as a result of Universal Credit. It comes after Ms McVey was accused of being in absolute denial as she dismissed the devastating NAO study in the Commons last week. The spending watchdog found the six-in-one benefit has not delivered value for money and its rollout has been slower than promised.

Then she suddenly drops to the floor, grinding and thrusting as if her life depended on it. Unsure of where to look or how to react, I opt for a contemplative expression, pen in hand - relieved at least that the smoky room and flashing lights are hiding my blushes. Then, when her three minutes are done, she blows over a kiss before gliding off the catwalk - and I look down at the score-sheet in front of me.  Having to mark a woman’s bottom between 0 and 10 makes me feel like the worst kind of person. But as a judge at Brazil’s bizarre Miss Bumbum competition, this is exactly what is expected of me - and as I put pen to paper the hundreds packing the room strain to work out which score I’m awarding her. One of the strangest, yet most fiercely-fought beauty pageants on the planet, in Brazil the annual contest to find the nation’s sexiest bottom is taken deadly seriously. And with the chance to become an overnight superstar at stake, hopefuls famously go to desperate lengths to take the title - from stripping off in public to bribery and even sabotage. Some candidates have been known to sell cars and even houses to finance their campaign for public votes. And now for the first time, butt-proud women all around the globe will be able to compete for an even more illustrious crown - Miss Bumbum World. Organisers said they decided to launch an international version of the contest after being inundated by messages and photos from big-bottomed women around the world begging for a chance to take part. And emotions are expected to reach fever pitch at the star-studded event in Miami in March next year, when Brazil’s national winner will compete against representatives from other countries around the world to find out who has the best butt on the planet. As the only non-Brazilian ever to be a judge on Miss Bumbum, in November last year, I was able to get a unique insight into what the race to next year’s ultimate best bottom award might be like - as well as behind-the-scenes antics and intrigue. As a journalist working in Brazil, I’ve reported on the craziest aspects of the competition - which today makes more headlines around the world than every other beauty pageant put together.  They included one hopeful who strutted naked through a shanty town controlled by gun-wielding gangsters to canvass for votes, another who was caught paying a witch doctor to cast a voodoo spell on a rival, and others who upset the Catholic country’s Christians by recreating the Last Supper scene wearing sexy lingerie at Easter. And no Miss Bumbum season is complete without a fair share of scandals and intrigue. Previous high(low)lights include allegations that one contestant had paid organisers around \u0026pound18,000 for second place others caught using computers to cast thousands of online votes and claims some women had cheated by having butt implants - the competition’s only rule is you can\u0027t. The mix of big bums and bizarreness is a recipe for unprecedented media attention. According to organisers, there have been more than 10.3 million articles written about the contest since it first began eight years ago, as well as 48 TV documentaries, including one for the BBC due to be aired in September.  And according to Brazil’s government, only the Rio carnival generates more international news about Brazil than the annual best bottom competition, where winners often go on to become household names at home and abroad. The event is so huge that Miss Bumbum’s creator, Cacau Oliver, now has his own reality show on Brazil’s E! TV channel, called Fame Maker. But nothing could have prepared me for the pressure cooker final of Miss Bumbum in a Sao Paulo bar last November, when the last 15 hopefuls - whittled down from over 2,500 candidates - got their last chance to impress before a panel of judges. Expectation was in the air as hundreds of reporters, photographers and TV cameras packed in to the Noo Bar in the city’s famous Vila Madalena district. As a guest judge I was ushered by security guards into the VIP area, where free food was laid out and I mingled with famous Brazilian stars such as funk DJ Mr Catra and Youtuber Caue Moura. I was one of ten judges - others included TV presenters and reality show stars - invested with the power to send one of the women waiting nervously in the wings to stratospheric heights. As the clocked ticked down to the long-awaited ceremony, excited showbiz reporters rushed to quiz us about our bottom preferences in the hope of gleaming some clue as to which of the 15 finalists might be crowned Queen. But the actual judging process, for such a huge national event, was surprising less rigorous than I had imagined. Each of the judges were giving a sheet with the names of the women, in the order they would appear, first fully dressed in an outfit or costume of their choosing, and second shaking their booty wearing as little as they wanted. For each appearance we were to give a mark between 0 and 10. Most notably, though, it was all about the bumbum. Forget inner beauty, personality, or even a pretty face, we were told, the only thing that mattered was the shape, size, shake and aesthetic of the ass.  By the time the first bottom wiggled on stage, this one belonging to the candidate for Rio de Janeiro, the crowd were in a state of near frenzy. Before each candidate appeared, a video showed her wiggling her bottom on a beach, as the show’s glamorous presenter Gracyanne Barbosa announced their name, age, and ass size. Gracyanne herself, while not being a great presenter, does have a 43-inch wide backside, which appeared to matter more. While some women opted for an evening gown, others were more creative, like the representative of the state of Amazonas, Rosie Oliveira, who strutted the catwalk dressed as an Indian with a huge feather headdress, before unfurling a Brazilian flag with the words “Temer Out!”, a reference to the country’s hugely unpopular president. Some of the other judges squealed excitedly and immediately scribbled ’10’ in her box.  But it was the ‘free dance’ sequence, during which the women returned to the stage to wiggle, thrust and grind their prize asset to the beat of pounding booty music, which brought the crowd to delirium. Excited photographers climbed on top of each other to get the closest shot and each of the contestants made the most of their three minutes to convince us they should be the next Queen of the Brazilian bumbum. One contestant slowly untied her bikini top as she danced provocatively to a slow ballad, another flew onto the stage as Wonder Woman and another strutted down the catwalk dressed as a sexy angel. This time Amazonas’ Rosie was dressed as a sexy jester with harlequin bikini and feathered tickle sticks hanging from her arms. When another wearing the tiniest silver G-string suddenly got on on all fours furiously thrusting her backside to the pounding beat of her chosen funk anthem, the crowd erupted in whistles and applause.  And after each performance, the room fell quiet and all eyes were on me and my fellow judges as we discussed everything from their twerking technique, roundness of their bottom, number of thrusts per second, even the amount of cellulite - before each scribbled down their score. Meanwhile, social media was going into overdrive as Miss Bumbum fans around the country followed the evening’s events, desperately wanting to know who their next bumbum idol would be. Once all the performances were over, the women retired backstage, where many sat nervously biting their nails, or pacing up and down, knowing that one bum wriggle could have made or broken them. On the competition floor, presenters made live broadcasts with their impressions and predictions. It was past midnight when, with all votes counted, the moment finally came for Miss Bumbum found Cacau Oliver to declare the winner. First, an award was made to the candidate who was the least bitchy to the others during the competition, Miss Sympathy, who was voted for by the other women. Then, as the 15 hopefuls lined up on stage, he opened the envelopes containing the name of the runner up, and the winner. And as - unsurprisingly - Rosie Oliveira was declared Brazil’s next Miss Bumbum, there were gasps of surprise and looks of sheer hatred from the other women. The 28-year-old gasped in disbelief and wiped tears from her eyes as the news sunk in, while the remaining 15 women, barely able to hide their disgust, marched off backstage without even stopping to congratulate her. But she didn’t care - suddenly hundreds of photographers were crowded around her, yelling for her to look their way as flashbulbs popped and reporters shouted questions while scribbling in their notepads.

The man and woman, both in their 40s, were discovered on Saturday evening at a home in Amesbury - just miles from where the Skripals were poisoned - and remain critically ill in hospital. One of the last places they were seen in public was a hog roast and family fun fair organised by the Amesbury Baptist Church. Health officials don\u0027t believe there is a significant health risk to the wider public, and no advice has been issued to people who may have been in contact with the couple. Do you know the couple in Amesbury? Email webnews@mirror.  Wiltshire Police have declared a major incident and said it was not clear if a crime had been committed, but detectives are keeping an open mind. A number of places known to have been visited by the couple in and around Amesbury and Salisbury have been cordoned off as a precaution. They include the home in Muggleton Road, where the man and woman were found unconscious, and nearby Amesbury Baptist Church. Police also had cordons at a Boots store in Amesbury and a Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury.  Church secretary Roy Collins said a family fun day was one of the last places the couple was seen in public before falling ill. The free event was held from 2-5pm on Saturday at Raleigh Crescent Green, featuring a hog roast and bouncy castles, games and entertainment for families, according to a Facebook event listing. Drone footage posted on the church\u0027s Facebook page shows children playing on bouncy castles, people queueing for food and others gathered under gazebos or tents to stay cool amid this summer\u0027s heatwave.  Mr Collins said: Last weekend we held a community fundraiser and we understand this may well be the last event this couple went to in public. He said he woke to find the church cordoned off by police at 6am on Wednesday. We are all quite puzzled and shocked - naturally the connection with Salisbury and recent events there mean there is a heightened public interest, he added.  We are praying for the couple, one of our members knows them and clearly there are concerns for them and any others in the community. They are not church members or regulars. Wiltshire\u0027s Police and Crime Commissioner Angus Macpherson said there is no indication the incident is linked to the nerve agent attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia earlier this year. Tests are being carried out to identify the substance, which was initially thought to have been from a bad batch of heroin or crack cocaine.    Police said: It was initially believed that the two patients fell ill after using possibly heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs. However, further testing is now ongoing to establish the substance which led to these patients becoming ill and we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding this incident. Both remain in a critical condition at Salisbury District Hospital. It is believed the Muggleton Road address is in a new housing development in the town near Stonehenge.  Health officials who are part of a multi-agency response have assured the wider public that they are not at significant risk. A Public Health England (PHE) spokesman said: The current advice from PHE England, based upon the number of casualties affected, is that it is not believed that there is a significant health risk to the wider public. This will be continually assessed as further information becomes known. The couple were taken to Salisbury District Hospital, which is open as usual and is advising people to still attend routine appointments unless they are contacted to state otherwise.  Mr Macpherson told the BBC there\u0027s present indication that the incident in Amesbury is connected to the Skripal case at present, and police have been working hard to contain any risk that might be there. He added: I haven\u0027t seen anything in this incident yet that I would consider to be an overreaction, it all seems fairly textbook. A Government spokesman said: Ministers are being kept up to date about the incident in Amesbury. Mayor of Amesbury councillor Margaret Strange said she was in the dark about what happened.  After speaking to police at the address in Muggleton Road, she said: I know as much as anybody else. Asked if she was worried with this incident happening so soon after the Skripals, Ms Strange replied: Well, obviously, because when you think like that happening a few yards from your own home. I am not saying a single thing because I don\u0027t know anything. I only know there was an incident and I know nothing more than that. People with information about the incident are asked to call Wiltshire Police on 999. "},{"url":null,"title":"englands bravest fan solitary three","story":"NewsEngland\u0027s bravest fan?

The streets of Cardiff were littered with used textbooks, cutlery, furniture and even cars packed with rubbish.  Alleyways around the Cathays area, a hotspot for student living, became dumping grounds for wrecked sofas and mattresses, reports Wales Online .  As of July 1 hundreds of students have flocked from the city, ready for two months of bliss in the sunshine before embarking on a new year of studying. The car park at Cathays train station, used by thousands of students, was covered in rubbish overflowing from a YCMA donation bank.  At its foot lies a full deconstructed kitchen, Tupperware, chopping boards, bowls, pots and pans and bottles of ketchup and mayonnaise all piled up. Expensive-looking textbooks, chairs, hairbrushes and DVDs were also poking out of the throng. As Paleontolgy postgraduate student Richard Jones walks past he stops to take a quick picture on his phone. He said: I was walking past a few weeks ago and there was a guy saying there was a handbag there that was selling for \u0026pound30 on eBay. He said he was going back the next day and fill the car up. A few minutes walk from the station lies Miskin Street. On the corner two green and white striped deck chairs stand ready for their occupants to return and enjoy the sunshine.  On closer inspection, however, the seats are ripped, with a large bottle of Smirnoff vodka lying yards away. Meanwhile others have taken to twitter to share pictures of the mess, including a car left full to bursting with belongings. A few yards away builder Christopher Williams is hard at work, gutting a house under the beating sun. The plan is to turn the semi-detached house from separate flats to one big HMO, or house in multiple occupation. For him the state of empty student houses are something he has had to get used to, although the smell of rotting food never quite goes away. The 39-year-old said: When I started I was shocked. Mainly it\u0027s just dust and dirt but you do expect that. Then there\u0027s freezers full of stuff, food in the cupboards, in the fridges. It\u0027s all mouldy but what can you do? When you have a fridge with no electricity you just have to see what\u0027s in it. The smell just hits you. [My colleague] has got a really weak stomach. It\u0027s just sad for the landlords, they put their hearts into these places.  In a matter of weeks the house will be completely renovated ready for a new batch of inhabitants. Luckily, not everything inside it will be scrapped. The Cardiff builder said: Nine times out of ten I will take things to charity shops so they can make a bit of money. This morning someone came and picked up two cookers, gas hobs and extractor fans. If you give them a bit of a clean most of it can be re-used. Sometimes there are clothes with tags still on. A few doors down from Christopher postgraduate student Jessica Jones is busy scrubbing her front yard to remove the debris from last year\u0027s tenants. Today is her second day in Cardiff after moving from Manchester to study music. The 22-year-old said: The street looks derelict but inside the houses are quite nice. I come from Manchester so I\u0027m quite used to use but there are some messy students around here. A lot of people have left stuff they don\u0027t really want. There\u0027s a few interesting bits, chairs, barbecues. The amount of money that students get through is crazy, things become disposable after a year. Around Cathays other students have had similar experiences. Royal College of Welsh Music and Drama student Katie Bayliss has still got one more week before moving out.  She said: It\u0027s stressful. You have to make sure everything is spick and span while making sure you get your own stuff ready. Some people just don\u0027t care and the sea gullscome and open the bags. We try our best obviously because there are families near but you can\u0027t help it when the seagulls are ripping everything. The worst is the food left in the recycling bins. In this heat it\u0027s horrible, I have to hold my breath walking past it.  Around Cardiff there are thought to be 75,000 students across Cardiff University , Cardiff politan and the University of South Wales.  On Tuesday afternoon Cardiff council maintenance teams and members of Cardiff University are circling the area, determined to keep up with the volume of rubbish coming from each house. On Rhymney Street local landlord Michael Krokos is getting ready to go visit one of the seven HMOs he owns across Cardiff. Born and bred in the city, he claims to know every tenant on a first name basis to minimize the risk of nasty shocks when they move out. The 50-year-old Cardiff graduate said: It\u0027s quite spooky like this. It feels like one of those zombie movies. He added: The problem is not so much the students but relying on the duty contractors as you book them months in advance like the cleaners, painters, decorators. They know they\u0027ve got you in a tight position so they can mess you around or not turn up. A bigger problem still for Michael is absentee landlords who are not so quick to clean and update houses. He said: There are issue with landlords but the first thing I try and do if find out what the agents are and if the agents aren\u0027t going to be compliant I go to the registry office to find out who owns it.

She can come home and collapse at 4pm!   And user Speakout said that she let her kids have a \u0027monthly duvet day\u0027 when they could choose a day to have off school. But others were quick to disagree.

Madelon Guinazzo, 50, has been a professional ‘cuddlist’ since 2009 and earns \u0026pound60 per hour cuddling members of the public. Although she made a life out of snuggling with strangers, Madelon, from Chicago, US, admits that she has been in several uncomfortable situations - but suggests it is an expected part of the work she does. Despite this she claims that alongside being able to make large sums of money from cuddling, it makes her feel empowered in her everyday life.   Madelon now earns up to \u0026pound2,500 a month, working with cuddle company, Cuddlist , and often provides up to 10 hours of cuddling sessions per week.  Madelon said: “Cuddling is amazing – I get to see the best in people and enjoy the essence of who they are without demands or expectations for them to be different. “I have always been more comfortable than the average person with physical affection, so I do really enjoy cuddling! “However there are boundaries that have to be made, and I have a “trust agreement” with each of my clients to make sure someone says if they feel uncomfortable.  “My personal limit is having ten one-hour sessions per week – so that I don’t burn out and I can give each client my best. In addition to making money from cuddling alone, Madelon also trains others to become cuddlist\u0027s themselves. However, despite loving her job, she claims that she does continually receive controversy for her unique career. She said: “It is daunting to be controversial and a target for people’s discomfort around the need for closeness.  “The fear of things becoming sexual often leads to people calling this ‘paying for affection’ or labelling it as ‘pathetic’. “I often get accused of being something that I am not – it can look like I am selling intimate touching services. “Instead what we do teach is invisible – the skills necessary for healthy cuddling which are exercising choice, consent and boundaries. “Sometimes people need to take time to practise good self-care, take a break and just lighten up!” "},{"url":null,"title":"private gmail messages can read","story":"NewsPrivate Gmail messages \u0027can be read by third-party app developers\u0027Questions have been raised by reports in the US about the level of data that can be accessed and how aware people are that they are agreeing to share private emails\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByJamie Harris19:19, 3 JUL 2018NewsGoogle\u0027s API services policy states that any third-party must provide clear and accurate information explaining the types of data being requested (file photo) (Image: Getty Images AsiaPac)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Private Gmail messages can sometimes be read by third-party app developers, Google has confirmed following privacy concerns.

This summer, we should be trying to leave a heaped one in the garden as often as pssible.  It sounds bizarre - and unhelpful, given that sugar attracts ants and wasps , and we tend to not want them crawling and buzzing around too much.   But there is one creature who will really thank you for it.  Whether you think they\u0027re a nuisance or love them, the fact is we rely on bees a lot. In fact, almost a third of the food we eat is pollinated by these insects who are responsible for feeding 90 percent of the world’s population.  Remove them from the ecosystem, and we have a serious problem. Unfortunately, that\u0027s what we appear to be doing, as a combination of pesticides, urbanisation and climate change are causing bee numbers to drop dramatically. If bees were to disappear from the face of the earth, humans would have just 4 years left to live, Attenborough has said in the past.  Here\u0027s where a spoonful of sugar comes in.  This time of year bees can often look like they are dying or dead, however, they’re far from it, Attenborough said according to Country Living .  Bees can become tired and they simply don’t have enough energy to return to the hive, which can often result in being swept away.

The day - a federal holiday - marks when the US won independence from the British Empire after the Revolutionary War. The 4th July celebration commemorates the adoption of the Declaration of Independence 241 years ago on July 4, 1776. It\u0027s historically important for Americans, but it has also become a huge holiday celebration with parties and events across the country in every state. The day is commonly associated with fireworks, parades, barbecues and picnics, family reunions and baseball games. It\u0027s an excuse - or reason - to go all out and celebrate what makes the United States, well. the United States. When is Independence Day? July 4 or as they say, the 4th of July.  What is Independence Day and what\u0027s the story behind it? It’s one of the biggest holidays in the US calendar. The 4th July marks the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, which was signed in 1776. The Thirteen Colonies of America declared themselves states and no longer part of the British Empire. The Revolutionary War continued for awhile after though.  The history... The United States of American used to be Thirteen Colonies - a collection of East Coast states, they were Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut, Massachusetts Bay, Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Virginia, New York, North Carolina, and Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. The colonies were run by the British, who had been on the continent since 1587. At first the relationship between the Brits and the settlers was perfectly amicable, but soon their were complaints about taxes and the British influence. The settlers felt their own sense of pride and nationalism. In 1765 the settlers asked for \u0027no taxation without representation\u0027 which basically means they wanted a voice in Parliament. The British and settlers didn\u0027t exactly settle the issue and the disagreement often erupted into fights such as the Boston Tea Party in 1773, which was a protest against the Tea Act, which gave a British company monopoly over tea sales in the American Thirteen Colonies.  Further acts that took away power from states such as Massachusetts, which had been semi-autonomous, caused further friction. When things reached a head a meeting was called by the Continental Congress - the delegates from the Thirteen Colonies. At the second meeting the group decided to declare war against the British - it was 1775. The Declaration of Independence It was the next year, still during the American Revolution that the Second Continental Congress voted to approve a resolution of independence that had been proposed in June by Richard Henry Lee of Virginia declaring the United States independent from Great Britain rule.  The legal separation of the Thirteen Colonies from Great Britain actually happened on July 2, but the Declaration of Independence, a statement explaining this decision, which had been prepared by a Committee of Five, with Thomas Jefferson at the helm, wasn\u0027t signed then. Congress debated and revised the wording of the Declaration, finally approving it two days later on July 4. It was signed by 56 representatives from the thirteen states - known before as the Thirteen Colonies. The fighting didn\u0027t cease, it carried on until 1783 and the Treaty of Paris. The day the Declaration was signed was seen as the birth of the nation - and Independence Day was born.  How is it celebrated? It\u0027s probably easier to ask how it isn\u0027t celebrated! Fireworks, picnics, feasts, baseball, family gatherings, parties...the list goes on. Rhode Island saluted with 13 gunshots on July 4, 1777 on the first anniversary - the area has held the longest running Independence Day celebration in the United States. George Washington in 1778 - then a general in the revolutionary army - gave his troops a double ration of rum to mark the occassion. While you\u0027d think the first song to mark the day may have been Star Spangled Banner it wasn\u0027t. Psalm of Joy by Johann Friedrich Peter from Salem, North Carolina seems to be the first song attached to the celebrations.  How does Government mark it? It was made an unpaid national holiday in 1870 for federal workers, and then in 1938 it became a paid holiday across the States. A salute from one gun in each state called the salute of the union is fired at noon by military bases. What songs are linked with it? The national anthem The Star-Spangled Banner, God Bless America, America the Beautiful, My Country, \u0027Tis of Thee, This Land Is Your Land, Stars and Stripes Forever, and regionally, Yankee Doodle in northeastern states and Dixie in southern states. Some of the lyrics recall images of the Revolutionary War or the War of 1812.  Party ideas and items If you\u0027re staying in... Amazon do a pack of 30 US cupcake toppers flags for 89p.

The word was scrawled in red across the chest of a tribute to midfielder Fyodor Cherenkov, regarded as one of Spartak Moscow\u0027s best players ever. Moscow police said one person was detained after the statue outside Spartak Stadium was vandalised before Tuesday night\u0027s round of 16 match. Police did not identify the suspect or reveal the person\u0027s nationality, but local media claimed it was an England fan and the Foreign Office says it has offered assistance to a British man stopped by police in Moscow.  Photos of the vandalised statue sparked outrage on social media in Russia, with users directing their anger towards England fans. The red lettering was washed off afterwards. Police assured fans that the incident was being investigated and that a suspect had been identified and detained. A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: “Our staff have offered assistance to a British man who was stopped by police in Moscow last night.”     If the detained fan held a ticket for the England v Colombia match they would have missed the penalty shootout thriller. Cherenkov was a prolific scorer with FC Spartak Moscow, hitting the net 86 times in 344 appearances from 1977 to 1990. The footballer, who died aged 55 in October 2014, won four titles with Russia\u0027s most successful club, and also played for the Soviet national team, with 43 caps. He left Spartak Moscow in 1993 with a club record of 494 appearances. The two-time USSR player of the year was suffering from a brain tumour when he died.

It should be in the top division and I want to be part of helping the team to go up.”Siegrist confirmed a chat with his team-mate at last club Vaduz, Thomas Konrad, was a big help in him making up his mind to move to Scotland.Where he does disagree with the former Dundee defender is which is the No 1 outfit in his new home city.“I’ve played alongside Thomas for the last two years, so when I did make contact here I called him and asked him about the city.“It’s always good to get some information. He has told me some nice things about the city and he was very complementary about the place.“He tried to tell me the other team was the big one, so I didn’t listen. Obviously he played for them, but it’s all good.“He told me about some derbies but I believe he got sent off in one and did well in others. That’s him.“He did tell me that everyone is football crazy here and, when I arrived in the city myself, I couldn’t believe the stadiums are literally across the road from each other.“It’s good to be in a city where football is really a big thing.”With Slovakian goalie Matej Rakovan also signing up, Siegrist’s first challenge is to claim the No 1 jersey.It’s something he’s up for and believes having two keepers battling for a place in the team will prove a good thing for both men.“You come into a new club and you have to prove yourself. You’ve got to do all you can to earn the shirt. We’ve got to make it as hard as possible for the gaffer to pick one of us.“It’s his decision at the end of the day but I will be putting everything I can into making sure I play.“Everywhere you go you have to have competition. Especially the goalie position, there is only one who can play and, in every time you go, that’s how it is.“It is good to be on your toes, it’s good to have someone pushing you either way, so it makes you train that little bit harder.“It’s a long, tough pre-season and obviously my ambition is to be the No 1 goalkeeper and that’s Matej’s ambition as well. That’s how it should be.”Whether he’s between the sticks or on the bench, his focus is already on what every United fan wants to see – the team getting promotion in the coming season.And after a week working with the new-look squad, he’s feeling optimistic about that.“The main focus of the club is promotion.

Thankfully, it was and I’m here now.”Over the past week he’s been getting to know his new team-mates in pre-season training.He’s liked what he’s seen of them and is loving the workouts under his new boss Neil McCann.“I’m enjoying it a lot. The training has been very good. Sometimes you feel you are just running and running during pre-season but, to be fair to the manager, he’s had us doing ball work straight away.“With running as well, of course, but it’s been with the ball and match specific stuff so I am really enjoying it.“You can get that hard work when you have the ball as well and it is important because, at the end of the day, we are footballers.“We need to control the ball and things when we are tired in games, so, to me, it makes perfect sense to be training this way.“And I’ve only been here a few days now but already I’ve been impressed with the players. Technically, and in terms of the morale of the squad, they are very good.”While he wouldn’t claim to be an expert on the Scottish Premiership yet, what he’s already realised is that it’s a good place to be right now.With top English Premier League boss Brendan Rodgers already at Celtic and Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard taking the reins at Rangers, he knows it’s a league that’s being noticed.“I don’t know too much about the Premiership up here yet but what I do know is that it’s a good standard and it’s something I’ve been really looking forward to being a part of.“I’m stepping up and it will be a challenge, for sure, but I don’t think I will be out of my depth and I am looking forward to playing in it.“I’ve been told it’s definitely a good time to be coming to this league. There are a lot of good players and a lot of attention with what’s happened at Rangers.“Even without that it is still a good standard and a top league and this has all the makings of a good season for me.”Fans will got their first chance of a first look at Ralph last night when Dundee’s friendly programme kicked off with the short trip up to Brechin.Having finished playing at Woking back in April, he can’t wait to get back to a game situation.“I’m very keen to get started with the games and I’m looking forward to them, that’s what I came here for.“The Betfred Cup is coming soon but I feel with the fitness work we’ve been doing and, with the friendly games coming, we will be ready for them.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people job opportunities","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA local manufacturer has several positions available.Due to the steadily increasing demand for its products, the firm is looking to recruit city and guilds qualified bench joiners and wood machinists/CNC operators.Applicants who can demonstrate relevant experience of working in a joinery workshop environment may also be considered.The firm is also also seeking to appoint an experienced project coordinator to take responsibility for the preparation of the documentation necessary to enable manufacture to take place.

I love being able to tell the customer that the owners actually made the gift they are buying.”When it comes to working in retail Hannah says the most important thing is how you communicate with customers.She said: “The whole concept of the shop is to give customers that personal touch.“The most important part of that is how we interact with our customers.“The first thing you learn when you start work in the shop is everything else stops when a customer comes in and they become the most important thing.“We always say the staff in here love a chat but there is nothing better than a customer saying they have had a great experience in your store.“I really enjoying being able to serve someone well as that is what they will go and tell friends and family about and recommend the store to them.“You have to be approachable when working in retail and confident and comfortable speaking to people.“Confidence is something I have had to work on throughout my career, but it is something I would urge anyone interested in retail to work on too.”Although Hannah climbed up the retail ladder through working in several shops, there are many courses on offer in Dundee.Dundee and Angus College offer several in both retail and retail management.These include Introduction to Fashion Retailing where students get hands-on experience working within the college’s gift shop.HNC Retail sees students gaining a broad knowledge of the retail industry and the skills and qualities required for a diverse range of careers.The college also offers HND Retail Management where students have the opportunity to gain work experience managing and promoting the colleges pop-up shop, Tempus.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b39f0252c187-516x564.jpg ","title":"huge turnover of players has cost dundee united dear","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSince relegation from the top flight in 2016, Dundee United have seen a massive 86 transfers in and out of Tannadice.The remarkable turnover of players just shows what the price of failure is – by the club as a whole and those players, some of whom have been and gone with very little success.And, with business still to be done over the next couple of months in re-shaping the current squad, that total is expected to rise even further before too long.Since the departure of Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven at the end of January 2015 – the point where United’s downfall from cup finals and European football towards the second tier can be traced back to – the complete lack of continuity is an obvious factor in the club’s failure over recent seasons.Add in four managerial changes in that time and that’s a recipe for a whole lot of trouble.The number 86, obviously, includes a few players twice – i.e. they were transferred in and then transferred out – but since relegation the Tangerines have signed a huge 42 players in the past two years.Manager Csaba Laszlo has lifted the lid on how unorganised the club were last season and the number of ins and outs only strengthens that perception.This summer, Csaba, with help from chief scout Paul Sturrock, has brought in nine players already – with more expected.The big hope is this completely revamped team can finally get them back to the Premiership – something the 33 signings before them have distinctly failed to do.The pressure is on Nicky Clark, Callum Booth, Sam Wardrop, Fraser Aird, Craig Curran, Frederic Frans, Benjamin Siegrist, Matej Rakovan and Christoph Rabitsch to be the men that fire the Tangerines back up and have Arabs watching top-flight action come 2019/20.Last summer, 19 players were brought in by then manager Ray McKinnon and 13 the previous one immediately after suffering the drop.Of those 32, only 10 remain at the club and a few of those probably have a short future. They are Lewis Toshney, William Edjenguele, Stewart Murdoch, Fraser Fyvie, Deniz Mehmet, Billy King, Paul McMullan, Tam Scobbie, James Keatings and Sam Stanton. How many of them play a meaningful role in the push for promotion this coming season, however, is certainly up for debate.In the past two campaigns under McKinnon and Laszlo, United haven’t been a million miles away from getting themselves up through the play-offs.Add in a bit of continuity through their playing squad and around it surely can only help the club get back to where they feel they belong.A list of those 86 transfers, who have arrived, departed or done both: Harry Souttar, Darko Bodul, Eiji Kawashima, Chris Erskine, Michal Szromnik, Callum Morris, John Rankin, Paul Paton, Florent Sinama-Pongolle, Henri Anier, Edward Ofere, Guy Demel, Ryan Dow, Gavin Gunning, Toshney, Frank van der Struijk, Nick van der Velden, Willo Flood, Cammy Bell, Edjenguele, Murdoch, Tope Obadeyi, Alex Nicholls, Tony Andreu, Thomas Mikkelsen, Cammy Smith, Wato Kuate, Paul Dixon, Coll Donaldson, Simon Murray, Sean Dillon, Charlie Telfer, Luis Zwick, Blair Spittal, Brad Smith, Ali Coote, Grant Gillespie, Fyvie, Emil Lyng, Patrick N’Koyi, Paul Quinn, King, Scobbie, McMullan, Keatings, Craig Slater, Scott McDonald, Jordie Briels, Harry Lewis, Stanton, Brandon Mason, Anthony Ralston, Bilel Mohsni, Clark, Booth, Wardrop, Aird, Curran, Frans, Siegrist, Rakovan and Rabitsch.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b39f01324c04-e1530527591774-817x564.jpg ","title":"new boy elton looks to rocket dundee up the premiership table and says the skys the limit","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew boy Elton Ngwatala insists the sky’s the limit for Dundee as they look to make an assault on the Premiership top-half next season.The French midfielder, signed from Kidderminster Harriers earlier in the summer, made his second appearance in dark blue in last night\u0026#8217s 1-0 win at Cowdenbeath.This followed his debut on Friday night in a 1-1 friendly draw with Brechin City at Glebe Park.Fellow summer arrival, Senegalese striker Jean Alassane Mendy, got the visitors’ only goal just before the hour-mark as Kharl Madianga, Jack Hamilton, Nathan Ralph and trialist Brian Nana-Sinkam also got their first run-outs for Dundee.And 25-year-old Ngwatala believes there is no stopping him and his new team-mates from scaling the heights in the top flight next term – with a top-six finish a known aim of manager Neil McCann.“Friday night was my first game and it felt good to play with the new lads,” he said.“They are all new team-mates for me but, with 45 minutes in the tank, now I can improve.“Hopefully, within the next couple of weeks it will be perfect.“I think there is no limit next season. We have to take each game one by one and do the best we can to get the win.”Ngwatala admits the appeal to take his game to the next level was a huge factor in his move north of the border after playing in England’s sixth tier for the past three campaigns.As well as playing in front of terrific atmospheres at Dens Park, he is looking forward to testing himself on live television and under the spotlight of big crowds at Parkhead and Ibrox.He went on: “Dundee play in the Premiership so, for me, it was a big step up from playing in the Conference North in England.“It was important for me to move to Scotland and it feels like the right time to make this step.“I want to play at the highest level and going up against Celtic and Rangers is a big deal.“I have to test myself at the highest level.”Ngwatala also heaped praise on boss Neil and the rest of the staff at the club for welcoming him to the fold.The midfield man feels he has settled into the club with ease, though when asked if he has picked up on the local lingo yet, he said: “No, nothing yet!“The training has been nice to be fair, everybody has made me feel very welcome to the club, so it’s good,” he added.“The sessions have been good with the manager.”The Frenchman’s focus now is to show supporters more of what they can expect from him in the new campaign.He added: “I like to get on the ball, create things, make things happen.“Connecting and playing with my team-mates in short spaces is important but sometimes I do like a long shot!”Ngwatala’s new gaffer Neil was delighted his new boys got some valuable minutes under their belts despite drawing in Angus, saying: “I’m not really looking too much into the performances.“It was more just fitness and we had a number of new faces who joined us for the first time on Friday and it’s going to take a wee bit of time to get that understanding.“Overall, I was quite happy with the two 45 minutes.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2a29a52ebfe-668x564.jpg ","title":"paralympian cyclist hannah thanks all who contributed to championship funds","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Paralympic cyclist, who found her passion while studying in Dundee, has crowd-funded enough money to enable her to compete – and also a surplus to help other cyclists.Hannah Dines, 25, who has cerebral palsy, was recently chosen for the Paracycling Road World Championships.

We were given no notice about the closure and told we have less than a week’s wages to collect.“The team at Mayfly were almost a family, and to have been shown so little regard makes us angry, but it also made us aware of how unstable the hospitality industry is and something needs to change.”Those who had events lined up at the venue were also stunned.Joanna Susskind, founder of life drawing group All The Young Nudes, said: “It’s very sudden and unexpected and we’re looking for a new venue.”Chris and Gordon’s Pub Quiz said on Facebook: “Due to the out-of-the-blue closure of the Mayfly, we will postpone our next event until a later date.”The closure comes after the Ridgevale Bar and Kitchen, inside the Hampton by Hilton hotel at Marketgait, closed suddenly in February after just 10 months.

Those taking part are required to eat as many tea cakes as they can in four minutes.It doesn’t end there though – after consuming as many tea cakes as they can stomach, contestants will then be required to drink a can of Irn Bru in 60 seconds.Brechin has hosted the motorcycle festival for a number of years, due to the town being the home of the original Davidson family before they emigrated to the US.As many as 500 bikers are expected to participate in the highlight of the weekend, the Saturday ride-out, which will roar through the town before heading past the restored farm cottage which was once the home of the family which gave its name to the brand.Netherton Cottage, a few miles west of Brechin, was the house from which Sandy and Margaret Davidson emigrated to the US in the mid-19th Century, before their grandsons went on to found the brand.Restored by enthusiasts, the cottage at the roadside between Brechin and Forfar is now a place of pilgrimage for Harley-Davidson enthusiasts from across the globe.Originally established by the Bravo Brechin group, the festival is now led by a team of volunteers. Committee member Dean Walker said: “We got the confirmation yesterday that the tea cake event was going to go ahead.“We got in touch with Tunnocks and this is the first time they are going to do it.“I am going to give it a try but I don’t think I am going to win it.“It is something different on Saturday, a bit of fun for everyone.“I just want as many people to come out and enjoy the festival.“This is for the whole of Angus and we have people coming from all over the world too.“This year will be the biggest festival yet and it will be held over two days.“On the Saturday, Brechin town centre will be closed off and pedestrianised.“This year we are expecting more than 400 bikes and hundreds of Harley-Davidsons to head to Brechin.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3b4ebcc665e.jpg ","title":"travellers urged to abide by the law after plotting up again at camperdown","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA councillors is urging Travellers to make use of sites available to them instead of setting up camp illegally.Caravans have been spotted once again at Camperdown Leisure Park, next to Dundee Ice Arena.A motorhome, a caravan and two cars were parked in the car park across from the venue.Councillor Kevin Keenan, who represents the Strathmartine Ward, said: “I passed at the weekend and noticed them then.“There is a site at Tealing and there was talk of another site that was meant to be at Camperdown Park, essentially a bit fenced off. I know some people were a bit upset by that, as they did see it is giving away part of the park which was gifted to the town. But I suppose it puts people into one area which is designed for that purpose.“I think the idea would be to engage with the Travelling community more, provide skips for them to get rid of their rubbish and in return get some payment from them. Legislation is in place to remove people who camp illegally, and I do think any legislation has to work both ways.”The new camp comes just over a month after Travellers set up in the same location.The group had moved to the site after being evicted from a spot outside Toys R Us at Kingsway West Retail Park.The group had parked outside the store, which closed in April, across disabled bays, and had set up fixtures such as barbecues.The area at Camperdown Leisure Park is not licenced for the purposes of camping, therefore anyone who sets up caravans at the site is doing so against the law.Dundee City Council provides a purpose-built caravan park at Balmuir Wood in Tealing, for up to 20 pitches.Each site has its own utility unit, and a hook-up facility for electricity. The utility units contain a kitchen and a shower, as well as room for storage. There is also a children’s play area.The site is just six miles out of Dundee and has local shops, a doctor’s surgery and a primary school nearby.A Dundee City Council spokeswoman said: “We are aware of the situation and are continuing to monitor it.” A Police Scotland spokesman said the force had not been notified of the group at the leisure park.According to housing charity Shelter Scotland, Travellers staying on private sites can be evicted “fairly easily” by landowners if they do not have permission to be there.The charity said: “If you park up on private land without consent, the owner or legal occupier – for example, a tenant – can take steps to evict you.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/59dc8f56e5322-e1530277496193.jpg ","title":"volunteer drivers needed for dundee charity delivering food to impoverished folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new charity aimed at alleviating food poverty among families in Dundee is urgently seeking volunteers to carry out its summer programme.Dundee Bairns delivers breakfasts and lunches to impoverished families in the city during the school holidays.It is looking for delivery drivers and attendants to assist with deliveries during its Summer Fun and Food Programme which begins on Monday July 2 and ends on Friday August 11.The charity provides vans so drivers do not need their own car.

It also aims to guarantee that all commitments to suppliers are fulfilled.The Inverness franchise has been held for about the last two years by American Jack Alldredge who is understood to be from Florida.The company\u0027 managing director Mike Williams said Mr Alldredge had hoped to settle in the UK after visiting the country.\"He loved the idea of living here and fell in love with Inverness,\" Mr Williams said.\"But he has had immigration issues. Sometimes we make it difficult for people to invest in this country. It is a shame.\"For the past 18 months, Mr Alldredge has tried to manage the store from America but the shattering of a glass panel in the building \u0026ndash understood to be leased \u0026ndash was the final straw at the beginning of June.\"Fortunately, no one was hurt,\" Mr Williams said.\u0026nbsp\"In our 18-year history, we have never closed a store apart from relocation so it is sad that after the roof \u0026lsquoexploded\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash which was a glass entrance, leaving a very dangerous situation with other panels \u0026ndash Jack decided to call it a day.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMr Williams said he was disappointed for Mr Alldredge as well as the store\u0027 three employees including a manager.As the store was operated as a franchise, Ableworld is not obliged to step in but it is aiming to honour commitments to suppliers and customers.\"Although saddened by the situation, Ableworld will ensure that all suppliers of stock to the company will not lose out and either Highland Mobility (Ableworld Inverness) will settle all accounts or Ableworld UK will satisfy all the suppliers,\" Mr Williams said.\"Also no customer will lose out on their present deposits or product delivery of orders.\"Ableworld will be setting up support networks for past customers of products and writing to customers explaining the situation.\"Too many businesses in our industry and others pull the plug and leave their customers and suppliers high and dry which is something we will not do.\"He also revealed the company was actively looking to open another franchise in the Inverness area.Inverness MP Drew Hendry said the store\u0027 closure would be a great loss to many disabled people. Citing the high-profile case of city guesthouse owners Russell and Ellen Felber who are fighting deportation to America, Mr Hendry said this was another example of how immigration policies were not working.\u0026nbsp\"I am already working with countless other local families facing a similar fate, including the Felbers whose ongoing battle to stay in Inverness is utterly heart-breaking,\" Mr Hendry said.Inverness disability rights campaigner David Sansum said there were few mobility aid suppliers in the city while the next nearest store was about 40 miles away in Forres.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"I\u0026rsquom sure the closure of Ableworld will leave a big gap,\" he said. \"It is shame.\"\u0026nbspIn recent months, there have been a spate of incidents at Inverness retail parks where glass panels have fallen from overhead canopies.In March, Highland Council urged building owners with glazed canopies to check adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements were in place while Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans called for glass panels to be removed from canopies at all the city\u0027 retail parks.Wednesday 4 Jul 2018 11:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/01828000/01828031.jpg","title":"Druim Ba wind farm rejected","story":"Plans for 10 turbines at Druim Ba between Kiltarlity and Abriachan have been rejected today by the Scottish Government after a second public inquiry.\u0026nbspGeneral wind farm campaigner Lyndsey Ward was \"delighted\"She said: \"The community has had seven years of wind farm developers trying to get a wind farm in that area.

remains over funding formula","story":"\u0026nbspIMMINENT repairs to an Inverness road which has been dubbed the worst in the city have been welcomed \u0026ndash as a councillor renewed calls for changes to a funding formula which he claims leaves busy urban routes at a serious disadvantage.Milton Crescent in Hilton is to be completely resurfaced at a cost of \u0026pound100,000 and the work is due to start on Monday.Other roads across the city \u0026ndash including Midmills Road in the Crown area and Caledonian Road and Montague Row in Dalneigh are also set to have their potholes filled in.But Ness-side councillor Ron MacWilliam has called for a rethink on the way damaged roads are prioritised.At present, funds are allocated according to a formula which gives more weighting to length of road than traffic volumes.As a result, Mr MacWilliam said roads in Inverness were having less money spent on them than rural roads in the far north of Sutherland. He also said more needed to be done if city drivers were going to notice any significant difference.\"The fact the council is now looking to repair roads within the city is a start, but there are a lot of routes \u0026ndash particularly in areas such as Hilton and Lochardil \u0026ndash which are still very bad,\" he told the Courier.\"The roads budget is woefully inadequate. The roads office has a fantastic team but they are fighting a losing battle.\"With regards to the funding formula, Mr MacWilliam said he was continuing to press the matter but he faced strong opposition from the much larger number of Highland councillors who represent rural wards.However, residents in Milton Crescent are just happy that work there is finally going ahead.Edward Dyce (76) relies on his vehicle to get around and said: \"I have had a lot of problems with my car because of the road surface. It\u0027 getting worse because of the amount of traffic.\"A lot of people use the road and the potholes have become a real problem.

get into hostel dorm","story":"\u0026nbspA WOMEN\u0026rsquoS rights group has expressed concerns for the safety of guests staying at a Highland hostel after one of its bloggers was able to book herself into a male-only dormitory.Inverness Youth Hostel in Victoria Drive allowed Trina Budge to stay in a men\u0027 room after she told a receptionist she self-identified as a man.She went on to write a blog post about her stay and said she is concerned women could be at risk as a result of people taking advantage of the self-determination policy.She said: \"There are huge concerns over safety. When you book a single-sex room at a hostel you expect it to be exactly that.\"We are not anti-transgender but we are concerned there are people who will take advantage of the policy.\"There\u0027 a danger that people who are genuinely transgender will become scapegoats because of people who abuse the policy.\"I have emailed Hostelling Scotland with regard to what happened and have asked to discuss with them how they plan to protect the needs of all their guests.\"Mrs Budge\u0027 blog post included a screenshot of an email in which the hostel revealed it did not have \"a specific transgender policy\" but would book accommodation \"based on how our guests choose to be recognised\".A spokeswoman for the Highland LGBT Forum said: \"The hostel decided to take her at her word. I don\u0026rsquot think that was the correct decision.\"A person who identifies as a specific gender will always try and present themselves as such.\"This woman found a loophole in the way the hostel treats transgender people. It\u0027 a difficult problem, and the youth hostel need to look into it.\"The important thing that stuck out in the original blog post was that Hostelling Scotland does not have a specific transgender policy.\"They allocate rooms based on how guests choose to be identified but people who genuinely are transgender will present themselves as the gender they wish to be recognised as.\"Despite the incident, Hostelling Scotland insisted that it will maintain its policy.A spokesman said: \"Hostelling Scotland is an organisation open to all and we treat all our guests with respect and dignity.

Milne said: “This is one of the most important occasions for the club.“What we are going to embark upon over the next three to four years is this facility and then move on to the stadium.“That is really going to transform the club and set us up on a fantastic basis to move into the next period.“To finally get on site and see the diggers working is a massive day for the football club.“I am very proud that we have achieved that.”Aberdeen put the application for the £50m stadium and training facility on hold last October as they wanted more time to discuss the matter with planners.In January the plans were approved by councillors when members voted 32 to nine in favour of the application to build the new stadium and training facilities.“It has been a long, frustrating journey, the best part of 20 years that we have been trying to get a site for a new stadium and the much-needed training facilities,” said Milne.“At times you feel you are making progress and then for whatever reason things grind to a halt.“The fact this is the third site we have actually got planning permission for speaks for itself.“The other two we got the consents but for various reasons outwith the club’s control we weren’t able to go ahead with them.”The first phase of the £50m development will include the construction of the training pavilion, groundsman’s accommodation, three professional training pitches, two 3G pitches and two grass pitches.Milne confirmed the full £10m has yet to be secured but he is confident of raising the funds.He said: “We still have work to do to get the balance of the funding in place.“But we are confident that one way or another we will get that lined up.“Everyone knows it has been a really challenging last few years economically for everyone in the region.“It is not the ideal time to be raising funds but one way or another we will get that.”The No Kingsford Stadium protest group are pursuing a judicial review in a bid to stop the project going ahead.Aberdeen-based McIntosh Plant Hire now have the go- ahead to begin the initial earthworks and ground remediation in preparation for the building work, which is scheduled to start in October.Milne said: “This is the start of delivering the much-needed facilities for the club.“Hopefully this time next year we will be standing here and seeing the first phase come into completion.“Seeing the guys come back for their pre-season training next year with their base here will be absolutely fantastic.”Following the completion of the training complex the Reds will then have to secure the £40m for the stadium, which is scheduled for completion in 2021.At the club’s AGM last December Milne confirmed the sale of Pittodrie would raise 40% of the £40m, i.e. £16m.That still leaves a £24m shortfall.Milne said: “Once the first phase is delivered we will have to step back and take a deep breath before we tackle the stadium.“That will be a major challenge to raise all the funds that are required for that.“If we can deliver the first phase it will be a massive step forward.”Aberdeen are now the official owners of the 25-hectare site at Kingsford and contracts are due to be agreed in the coming weeks for work such as pavilion construction and the formation of the pitches.It is now almost two decades since Aberdeen first announced their intention to move from Pittodrie in January 1999.The club had earmarked a site on the road between Aberdeen and Kingswells to become the new home for the Dons.Planning consent was eventually granted, but on the condition that the Scottish FA were successful with a bid to host the Euro 2008 finals.When the Euro bid failed, so did the proposal.Aberdeen also planned on a move to a stadium at Loirston, but with an additional smaller stadium at Calder Park. But in August 2012 city councillors voted by 24-19 to retain control of Calder Park.Then aspirations to house the training complex at Balgownie, Bridge of Don, collapsed in 2015.Throughout all those setbacks Milne never gave up hope of delivering a state-of-the-art training complex.“You always have to believe that you will get there in the end,” he said.“It would be easy to give up when you keep hitting brick walls and are thinking you are not going to get there.“But we have a lot of good people around us as part of the team over the years and they have been a good driving force as well.“This is a reward for an awful lot of people who have put hard work in including Derek (McInnes), who has played a key role in helping us get consent.“He hasn’t just stayed there in the background to wait and see what happened.“He took very much a forward role in the whole thing and that has been very beneficial to us.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"boss mcinnes on kingsford we dont just want to do it we want it to be as good as it can be","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBoss Derek McInnes says Aberdeen want to have a stadium and training facilities that are the envy of other clubs.Work began at Kingsford yesterday on the site of the Dons’ new stadium, training and community complex.McInnes, club chairman Stewart Milne, AFC Community Trust chief executive Ally Prockter and Lord Provost Barney Crockett attended a ceremonial sod-cutting to mark the beginning of construction.The Reds hope to be able to start training at the new facility during pre-season next year.McInnes believes the training ground is a legacy project for the club and wants it to be the envy of other teams.He said: “I think in time what we will have will be the envy of a lot of clubs in having the stadium and the facilities together.“I think every club who have made that investment are proud of their facilities and we want this to be something we can be proud of and other teams can admire.“We want to do it as well as we can, we don’t just want to do it \u0026#8230 we want it to be as good as it can be.“Every day now there will be that step towards where we want to be and there will be that improvement. Today is a pivotal day for that. It’s got to start somewhere.“A lot of good work has been done by the legal team and the case we have put for having these facilities in the first place.“The actual physical part of it now begins and that’s just as important.”Currently the Dons train in a number of different places around the Granite City including Balgownie and Aberdeen Sports Village.Having been at Pittodrie for over five years McInnes wants an end to the days of ferrying his players around Aberdeen in minibuses to find somewhere to train.He added: “It is a significant day, it’s the official day of starting the work and hopefully everything can be quite smooth.“These things are never simple, but we have an idea in mind of when we actually visibly see ourselves there training, and hopefully that will be the case.“We are five years on, but the problem we have regarding training facilities is still clear even this week coming back from our pre-season tour.“Finding facilities is still a big concern for us as a staff, to try to get pitches of a certain level for players to train on.“This is an important reminder of just how important these facilities are going to be for everyone in the club.“Certainly in the professional department and also in the whole community.“I don’t think I was the only manager who was involved in talking about a new stadium or training ground.“This is something I’ve felt we’ve had to bang on about the importance of it.“It’s just far too important for too many people for a club like ourselves not to have up-to-date, modern facilities.“We want to be as good as we can be as a club and as big as we can be.“So to still to be going round the whole city in a minibus on different days of the week trying to find a piece of grass suitable to train on isn’t conducive to what we want to be.“We’re elite and professional in every aspect Monday to Friday, but a huge part of that is the training surfaces we train on. We’ve had to endure that the last five years.“Although it’s been spoken about over the last few seasons it’s gathered real momentum in the last couple years and this is where we are now.“Hopefully before too long we’re standing at the opening of the new training ground and talking about the benefits that is going to give to us.”McInnes also revealed that he and his staff have been involved throughout the project in deciding on the lay-out of the new complex.He said: “Myself and the staff sat down with the club at various stages along the way.“How it’s going to look is catered to what we think is right to not only satisfy the professional department on our practicalities but also the youth department and the community.“There are all these little issues, but once it’s built it’s built. We need to make sure it’s built exactly the way we want it.“We’ll try to use the space we’ve got as best we can.“The interior side of it and things like that can still be changed once it’s up and running, but the actual lay-out, we have been involved in that from day one.”McInnes also reckons the training facility will help him impress potential new signings in the future.“Once it’s built then it’s certainly something additional we can use to entice players and persuade players to come,” he said.“Once it’s up and built you can actually physically bring them here.“At the moment there’s nowhere to take the players and it’s one of those questions that’s asked.“If you’re trying to sign a Scottish player they know Aberdeen struggle for training facilities but other players from down south might not be aware of it.“But they soon are because you have to be open and honest with them.“Even recently the fact the club have been working towards this day of the training ground and new stadium being built, that indicates it’s an ambitious board and an ambitious club.“We’re making that financial commitment to get the facilities we should be having.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"first speakeasy in city set to bring spirit of jazz age","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen’s first-ever speakeasy is to open in the autumn after councillors gave the green light.PB Devco, which runs eight venues across Aberdeen, will launch the 21 Crimes “secret” bar at the former Filling Station premises on Union Street in late autumn.The bar – named after the number of offences that would result in deportation to Australia in the 1920s – will be at basement level and a grill house restaurant called Vovem will be on the ground floor.The project took a step forward yesterday when Aberdeen City Council’s licensing board met to grant the premises a licence.It means the bar can open until 3am at weekends. NHS Grampian asked PB Devco to explain how the premises would fulfil the licensing requirement of providing “significant entertainment”.In a letter to the board, NHS Grampian’s public health consultant Dr Tara Shivaji said: “I understand the basement bar will possibly be themed as a prohibition/1920s type premises with jazz, informal and recorded music provided.“The entertainment on offer at these premises would appear to be low key.”However, according to licensing board member Councillor David Cameron, PB Devco successfully argued at the meeting the bar itself would be a draw.“They put forward a very convincing argument and the idea of a secret bar with hidden entrances is very clever,” said Mr Cameron.He added: “Most importantly, they made a well-rounded argument to address all the concerns of NHS Grampian and the police.”PB Devco operations director Paul Clarkson said: “We are delighted with the licensing board’s decision.“It is great news. The venue will be exciting, though we want to keep certain details under wraps for now. It will create between 30 and 40 jobs and will be something completely new for Aberdeen.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"good causes meet in bid to learn from each other and get people into

like a coffee shop or what you would see on the continent – it’s more sleek and glossy and it really shows our products at their best.“And we have bought in a new machine to make the pie cases from South Africa, which is quicker and more professional than the 40-year-old machine we had before.”David continued: “From planning to completion, it’s taken about two years and we’ve spent around £60,000 to do the work but the results really speak for themselves.The inspiration for many of the changes came from mainland Europe.“My son Simon had seen what other bakeries were doing and ways that they were different and we used some of those ideas to plan the refurbishment of our premises.”The third generation family bakery has added a number of items to their offering, including new savouries (steak and cheese pies, as well as black pudding and sausage rolls) and ice cream – a perfect snack during the summer weather.But despite the many changes, David was keen to stress that one same has stayed the same.“Our customers will still get the same great quality and taste they have come to expect from Ross Bakery, although things may look a wee bit different.“The changes show that we are

NowThere are certain moments that just simply enchant us.One such moment happened this week when we were holidaying in Dunkeld.Almost every day we visited the wildlife centre at the Loch of the Lowes and delighted in our times watching the osprey.From the webcam we could see every detail.We watched with great anticipation to see when the chicks would emerge from their eggs, of which there were three.One of the days we went to the centre there was great excitement as one of the eggs was about to hatch.The staff there are dedicated volunteers who love sharing their knowledge of these wonderful birds.To our total delight we witnessed the birth first-hand as the shell cracked open and out struggled a tiny little chick as the mother bird looked on anxiously.I could hardly believe that this tiny scrap of life would be strong enough to fly to Africa in just a few months.Shortly, the father bird arrived with a very large fish and I was amazed at the tenderness of this great strong bird as he gently fed his baby.Since then we have been \u0026#8216hooked\u0026#8217 as we follow this wee family at the beginning of their journey of life.Soon the chicks will be given flying and fishing lessons and will leave the safety of the nest.My prayer is that they will all safely complete their long journey to Africa and that they will come back next year to enchant people once again.When they go, sometime in September, I fear that I will suffer from \u0026#8217empty nest syndrome\u0026#8217 till they come back again next spring.Scripture tells us: \u0026#8216Seek

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This is the same distance Mark averaged every day during his epic cycle round the world in 80 days last year.In other words the team of 80 intrepid cyclists will pedal the equivalent of Mark’s incredible feat – taking them around the world in a day.Participants are asked to raise a minimum of £240 each for the STV Children’s Appeal, which supports children and young people affected by poverty in Scotland, with the hope of raising as much as £80,000 for the charity.Mark said: \u0026#8216This stunning route from Argyll to Aberdeen was my last 16-hour training ride before I set out on the world challenge and it holds fond memories \u0026#8211 but it is very long and very hilly, so I’ll be impressed by everyone who signs up for this epic day of endurance.\u0026#8216The STV Children’s Appeal has gone from strength from strength, supporting so many brilliant charities and causes across Scotland.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction.

They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her.

After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

Collapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.  Now it is understood South Ayrshire Council bosses want to step in before it is too late. It is believed a last minute paper may go before councillors at full council in County Buildings on Thursday. The paper would ask politicians to approve the repair work. The council slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the hotel in March, which gave the owners 21 days to respond. There are fears Ayr train station could end up shut if no action is taken. And it has been slammed a risk to the public. The Post revealed earlier this month how the hotel has been bought by new Malaysian owners from Eng Huat Ung.  Station Hotel Action Group founder Esther Clark believes the hotel could be turned into a community centre and accomodation. She said it should be “split up and dispersed” but must generate an income. She has uncovered research, which reveals the hotel was built to a “high standard” with luxurious materials. One idea mooted by Ayr Renaissance is for a part of the building to be demolished and a new train station built. Others folk have called for the council to adopt the landmark for offices. It was hoped a big hotel group would step in and carry out refurbishment but it has failed to attract interest so far. Network Rail carried out scaffolding work on the building to safeguard the operation of the station and line in 2015. The hotel, a Grade 2 listed building, has remained shut since it closed suddenly in 2013. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company built the hotel, designed in the style of a French chateau, at a cost of \u0026pound50,000.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-braw-lads-gathering-2018-schedule-of-events","story":"EXCITEMENT is building in Galashiels as the town gets set for the Braw Lads\u0026rsquo Gathering.\nBraw Lad Greg Kelly and Braw Lass Kimberley O\u0026rsquoMay are leading this year\u0026rsquos festivities, with the big week getting under way on Monday, June 25.\nThe pair have already taken part in two Ride Outs so far \u0026ndash Spurs Night and Threepwood.\nAnd there is plenty more to come, with the traditional events taking place over the next week.\nHere is a full timetable, so you don\u0026rsquot miss anything.\nDon\u0026rsquot forget to keep checking \nwww.bordertelegraph\nand our \nBorder  Facebook page\nduring the Gathering to keep up to date and view our live videos.\nWhat\u0027s on:\nFriday, June 22\nSCOTTISH COUNTRY DANCE \u0026ndash at the Volunteer Hall. 7.30pm-11pm. \nTickets\nare \u0026pound7 and are available at the door.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716331864,16331716,16331598,16331405,16331392\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since.

closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep. It\u0026rsquos just amazing to see how some of them react.\"\nHaving embraced meditation and its healing benefits, I leave the studio feeling renewed, carefree and a little lighter on my feet.

window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity.

She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out.

An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes.

They were sitting lined up in their cars looking to see what was going on.  \u0026ldquoI have sat outside with my breakfast some mornings and have had to lift my bowl of cereal and walk back in the house.  Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p. We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.  Another resident, who declined to be named agreed, saying: \u0026ldquoWe are getting no privacy and I can\u0026rsquot even sit out in the back garden for people looking in.  Alan Glasgow, Dunedin Canmore housing director, said: \u0026ldquoWe are aware there are a small number of residents at Eskmills Road who have concerns about the garden fence.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to work with the community and local partners to see what can be done to help further increase privacy when people are using the nearby car park.  Dunedin Canmore stated that the pathway being used as a shortcut was the responsibility of East Lothian Council."},{"url":null,"title":"giant-mussel-sculpture-installed-in-musselburgh","story":"  The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"phonebox-removed-from-centre-of-haddington","story":"  The phonebox, outside the police station on Court Street, was removed by BT last Tuesday.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.

Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.

The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.

Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.

Students and staff were joined by other invited guests, including Dame Katherine Grainger - Britain\u0026rsquos most decorated female Olympic medallist - and singer-songwriter Midge Ure OBE.

The latest round of strikes involves waste operatives, who are members of the GMB, Unison and Unite. The striking employees are based at Hilton Depot and Mavis Valley Recycling Centre.  Local Unite Scotland convener Tommy Robertson said: \u0026ldquoStrike action is always a last resort designed to try and force management into reversing a decision that we oppose and reach an agreement. It is not something we want to do but we are being forced as the changes to member terms and conditions cannot\u0026nbsp be tolerated.  Staff are fighting against plans which include reduced annual leave and overtime payments.  Mr Robertson added: \u0026ldquoI would like to make it clear that we are not asking for anything to be added to our terms and conditions, only that what we currently have is preserved. Staff have already endured several cutbacks and are expected to provide services at the same levels even though many of their colleagues have left.

Joint Council Leader Andrew Polson added: \u0026ldquoThis notification of further strike action raises concerns over the unions\u0026rsquo commitment to resolving this dispute through constructive discussion.

Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  We were inundated with hundreds of votes from across Scotland, the UK and as far afield as the Netherlands, Sweden and the US, and our quest got folk talking and reminiscing in offices, pubs and on social media, revisiting and celebrating the music that has been the soundtrack to their lives.  So, here we have it: Scotland\u0026rsquos top 10 favourite albums.  10 \u0026ndash Raintown, Deacon Blue, 1987    The band\u0026rsquos debut is packed to the rafters with sheer quality and from beginning to end simply never lets up. Dundonian singer-songwriter Ricky Ross showcased his talent, intent and also a keen political and social awareness across 13 songs, among them Scotland\u0026rsquos other national anthem, Dignity.  9 \u0026ndash High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983    Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth and reimagined them as perfectly-crafted jangle-pop. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  8 \u0026ndash Strange Kind of Love, Love and Money, 1988    Though Love and Money\u0026rsquos particular brand of literate, glossy soul-pop looked to America for inspiration, lyrics about \u0026ldquoraining on Jocelyn Square were resolutely, affectionately Glaswegian. In another place, another time, Love and Money could have been the biggest band in the world.  7 \u0026ndash If You\u0026rsquore Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian, 1996    Second albums are supposed to be difficult but Belle and Sebastian arguably never surpassed the stunning collection of songs that comprised their sophomore effort, giving a masterclass in how to mix melody, melancholy, nostalgia and humour.  6 \u0026ndash Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991    The album that thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is This Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  5 \u0026ndash Heaven Or Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990    Elizabeth Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest musical pleasures and treasures, and this most accessible of Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is simply awash with blissed-out grandeur. Could they really have been from Grangemouth? Oh yes.  4 \u0026ndash A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984    Sounding nothing like anything else that came out of Scotland, the UK or indeed anywhere else in 1984, this debut fused spare synth precision with exuberant vocal sincerity to stunning effect. Tinseltown in the Rain, that bittersweet slice of cinematic perfection, remains the ultimate ode to Glasgow.  3 \u0026ndash The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008    Since Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos untimely death in May, listening to the music he and his bandmates created has been a particularly sad and difficult task. But this album is simply too good to stop listening to. Revisiting is painful but cathartic, and like all of the \u0026nbspHutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.\u0026nbsp  2 \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, The Trashcan Sinatras, 1993    From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  1 \u0026ndash Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989    Only seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. For almost 30 years it has offered endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  Here\u0027s what you said about Hats:  Christine Gardner, Rotterdam: Head and shoulders above the rest. A magnificent album that I continue to listen to regularly after almost 30 years. It is quite simply a masterpiece. It continues to draw you in, delight your senses, touch your emotions and somehow mirror your own very personal experiences. And yet it is also essentially Scottish \u0026ndash maybe something to do with our collective psyche, despite all our individual differences.  Martin McCarthy: Hats has so many layers, from dreamy songs like Over the Hillside and Let\u0026rsquos Go Out Tonight to more upbeat songs like Headlights on the Parade and \u0026ldquoThe Downtown Lights.  Saturday Night is just a sublime song, I love the pitch perfect bass, the stunning keyboards and Paul Buchanan\u0027s emotional voice. This was played at our wedding to a full dancefloor and will always be so special. The songs on Hats convey love, beauty, pain and loss, and can push me to tears of utter joy and euphoria.  Alex Watkins: It\u0026rsquos the album I always return to just something about the memories and emotions it always conjures up.  Kevin Jackson: Hats is the best album ever recorded anywhere by anyone. It touches you in a way that others must stand back in awe and adoration of. It is a thing of perfection. When some of the finest innovative talents of our time see it as one of the greatest albums ever, it is because it has no peers.  Peter Morgan: I\u0027m going to plump for Hats, that lush, aching, bruised and battered homage to love and loss.  John Reader: I listen to a lot of music, including lots of new stuff but always have Hats on at some point every week. Still hooks me in with its lush simplicity. I remember saying to someone more than 25 years ago that of all the music around at that time I reckoned I\u0027d be listening to Hats for the rest of my life. Not wrong so far.  Colin Lunn: I love A Walk Across the Rooftops, the best first album by any group, not only in Scotland but worldwide. However, Hats was probably a better, more perfect album although it didn\u0026rsquot have the same influence. Tough, tough choice but I\u0026rsquoll go for Hats by a very, very fine margin.  Here\u0026rsquos what you had to say about some of the other music on the list:  Kyle Wallace: I\u0027ve Seen Everything by the Trashcan Sinatras is part of the soundtrack to my life. Listened to it through my dad\u0027s death and the college years. So many great songs associated with great memories.  John Richards: This was a very difficult choice. Scottish groups (I\u0027m Welsh) have a disproportionately large place in my music collection \u0026ndash particularly those who came to prominence in the 1980s. My top 20 regularly features the work of the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue and Love \u0026amp Money. However, it\u0027s got to be an album from the year I turned 19, when I went to university and the myriad possibilities that life had to offer opened up before me. The song (and album) that soundtracked that life-changing period is still my favourite Scottish album: Strange Kind of Love by Love \u0026amp Money.  Stuart Duncan: My vote is for The Midnight Organ Fight by Frightened Rabbit. An album that, as your writer said, \u0026ldquomakes it feel it\u0026rsquos OK to be sad. The lyrics hit home more than any album I\u0026rsquove ever listened to. Scott Hutchison gave me a feeling that everything was going to be OK, that I would get through things. I\u0026rsquod say he helped changed me as a person. It still hasn\u0026rsquot stuck in that he\u0026rsquos no longer here [Hutchsion took his own life in May] but my vote would be the same regardless of the circumstances.  Danny Tennyson: My favourite album by a Scottish band \u0026ndash or any other band for that matter \u0026ndash has to High Land Hard Rain, by Aztec Camera. The fact that Roddy was probably only 15 or 16 when he wrote most of the tracks for the album makes it all the more remarkable. He continues to be a genius to this day.  Shane Brown, Illinois: Why is it that I live in the centre boring part of America (the states you fly over to get somewhere else interesting), and should by location and birthright be a huge fan of Slipknot, but instead find myself with a vast collection of Scottish indiepop? From the Cocteaus to the Fannies, Belle \u0026amp Sebastian to Teen Canteen, Scottish indiepop has been the soundtrack to my life. How and why the music of your land speaks to me, I\u0027ll never know, but no album speaks to my soul more than Cake by the Trashcan Sinatras \u0026ndash a record I find as comforting as a cup of coffee on a cold winter morning. I really, really love it to this day, and why those lads aren\u0027t universally revered as musical genius is beyond me to this day. I\u0027ve travelled hundreds of miles to see them live and I\u0027ll continue to do so as long as they grace us with the occasional American tour.  John Jauchler, Connecticut: Lots of good stuff on your list, but my vote goes to the Trashcan Sinatras\u0026rsquo I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything. Outstanding musicians and really nice guys as well. Their music has made a difference in my life.

The review is the second from a team led by the former Wickes and Iceland boss and comes amid a wave of closures and restructurings from major high street names including Toys R Us and Maplin and an ongoing shift to online shopping.  It argues that greater devolution and stronger local leadership is needed to give high streets a renewed sense of purpose and identity.  Among the 25 recommendations are calls to replace business rates, create a Town Centre Commission to develop a 20-year strategy for local high streets, and accelerate digital transformation in smaller towns.  Other recommendations include the appointment of \"high-quality\" designers to celebrate the historic character and local identity of town centres, 30 minutes\u0027 free parking in high streets with no paid extension option, improved street lighting and free public wi-fi.  Mr Grimsey said there had been some progress since his original 2013 review \"but not nearly enough\".

Take 1976, for example - a summer etched in the memories of many Scots, not just because the Wurzels\u0026rsquo topped the charts.  It was the year it was so hot the tarmac melted on Scotland\u0026rsquos roads and a hosepipe ban was put in place in parts of the country.    The summer of 1976 was the warmest in Scotland for more than a century, with temperatures reaching 29.5C at their peak, and one of only a handful of times when water restrictions were put in place north of the border.  While England and Wales suffered badly from drought that year, with widespread water rationing and the National Water Council advising people to only take a bath if necessary, most Scots escaped any such restrictions.  A hosepipe ban was put in place in the then Grampian region, which covered Aberdeenshire and Moray, but reservoirs were generally well filled because - as is often the case - the country had experienced steady rainfall in the spring and early summer.  There were large forest fires, in particular at Carrbridge near Aviemore, and the tar of the A9 between Perth and Inverness began to melt - prompting snowploughs to take to the roads in mid-July to spray sand onto the hot tarmac.  Many will also remember the swarms of ladybirds that infested towns and cities across Scotland that year, as well as the hikes in the price of salad items due to the heat - the Herald reported that tomatoes had increased by 10p per pound.  But while 1976 is the summer that sticks in people\u0026rsquos minds, Scotland has in fact experienced a drier one since then - in 1995.    As Scots listened to number ones from Robson and Jerome and the Outhere Brothers and watched Mel Gibson shout \u0026ldquofreedom in the cinemas, The Herald reported that teams of \u0026ldquowater-spies were out enforcing a hosepipe ban in the Highlands.  With just 141.6mm of rain falling that summer, the ban was put in place in the mid-Ross-shire area, and the then Highland region\u0026rsquos water authority warned it would not hesitate to prosecute persistent offenders.  Some households in the area got no water at all at times and the authority had to drive in tanker loads of water to fill up their tanks.  At the time, water director Jim Johnstone said: \u0026lsquo\u0026rsquoMy staff will be closely monitoring the situation and anyone found using a hosepipe in contravention of the ban will receive a letter.  \u0026ldquoIf they are caught for a second time, then we will report them to the procurator-fiscal for action.\u0026rsquo\u0026rsquo  Residents were told to use watering cans in their gardens instead, while motorists were encouraged to clean their cars using a bucket and sponge.  According to Scottish Water, which only came into being in 2002, water restrictions were also put in place in 1984 when a further long spell of warm weather gripped the country.  However, in more recent times, heatwaves have not caused much disruption for Scots.  The Met Office reports that the country enjoyed long spells of sunshine and high temperatures in 2006, which saw a new Scottish temperature record set at 29.8C in Dyce in Aberdeen, and 2013, but there were no restrictions put in place.  A year later, in 2014, a small group of Scots suffered a problem with their water supply, but it was not warm weather that caused it this time - it was the ice bucket challenge.  The craze became so popular with residents on the Hebridean isle of Colonsay that their water supply shut down.  Scottish Water had to make emergency supplies available to residents until it could be restored.    The recent spell of good weather has surpassed all other Scottish summers in terms of temperature, with the Met Office reporting that the mercury hit a provisional all-time high in Scotland as it reached 33.2C in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, on Thursday.  Wildefires have broken out in parts of the country, while lochs are losing water, including Loch Glascarnoch which has dried out in parts usually metres deep.  The longevity of the sunshine has also led some forecasters to draw comparisons with the summer of 1976, as it shows no signs of ending soon.  In response, Scottish Water yesterday issued guidelines on using water wisely, including asking Scots to take shorter showers and refrain from using hosepipes.  So, who knows? In years to come on a grey July day, we might all be reminiscing about the great summer of 2018."},{"url":null,"title":"sir-john-curtice-and-james-cosmo-receive-honours-from-queen-at-holyrood","story":"  Professor Sir John Curtice was knighted by Her Majesty at the Palace of Holyroodhouse on Tuesday, for services to social sciences and politics.

I was delighted when I first heard of this before Christmas of last year.  \"This is not something that I saw coming, not something I ever envisaged happening, but obviously heartening to have such recognition.  \"In truth, also, a lot of people have said a lot of very kind words over the last six months and for that I\u0027m undoubtedly very grateful.\"  Music at the ceremony came from the Countess of Wessex\u0027s string orchestra, with songs including Eleanor Rigby and Ed Sheeran\u0027s Thinking Out Loud.

It seeks to overhaul the current system \u0026ldquobased on fishing patterns from the 1970s, where EU states land eight times as much fish in UK waters as British vessels do in EU seas.  And it will set out a number of methods to explore \u0026ldquofairer allocation of fishing opportunities, such as zonal attachment \u0026ndash a system which would take the distribution of fish in national waters into account.  This would lead to a radical shake-up of the current system which reflects historic fishing patterns. British waters currently contain 88 per cent of adult North Sea herring, one of Europe\u0026rsquos most popular fish.  Mr Gove\u0026rsquos White Paper is expected to address concerns fishing could be used as a \u0026ldquobargaining chip in Brexit negotiations by making clear that market access for fisheries products is separate to the question of fishing opportunities and access to waters.  He said leaving the EU \u0026ldquocreates a sea of opportunity for our fishing industry in Scotland.  He added: \u0026ldquoOutside the Common Fisheries Policy we can take back control of our waters and revitalise our coastal communities.\"  But Scottish ministers raised \u0026ldquosignificant concerns over the proposals \u0026ndash which include charging for fish caught in excess of quotas \u0026ndash and slammed the UK Government for failing to engage, insisting they were only handed a copy of the final report days before publication.  Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: \u0026ldquoIt is deeply frustrating that once again the UK Government has failed to substantively engage with us while developing its future fisheries proposals.  \u0026ldquoThis near lack of formal engagement presents a significant and continued risk to the current devolved settlements and is totally unacceptable.  He said fishing is fully devolved, and insisted he would \u0026ldquoresolutely oppose any attempt to interfere with the established powers of the Scottish Parliament, the Scottish zone or Scottish vessels wherever they operate.  Until plans for a transition period, the UK will continue to follow EU fishing rules until 2020.  Mr Gove said the UK would end the \u0026ldquowasteful discarding of fish after Brexit and and make clear vessels will only be allowed to fish in British waters if they adhere to high sustainability standards.  His paper will also commit to publishing an annual statement setting out the health of fish stocks.  Meanwhile, access to waters and fishing opportunities would be negotiated on an annual basis, mirroring the approach taken in countries such as Norway.  Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen\u0026rsquos Federation, welcomed the blueprint but said governments now needed to show \u0026ldquoreal backbone to ensure the aspirations become reality."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-schools-are-being-swindled-by-toxic-legacy-of-pfi-claims-snp","story":"  Research shows councils will shell out nearly 10 per cent of their schools budgets servicing debt related to Private Finance Initiative (PFI) schemes this year.  PFI deals were used to build hundreds of new schools under Labour in Scotland, by contracting the work out to private firms.  But new figures highlighted by the SNP show councils will spend more than \u0026pound430 million this year paying off debt associated with constructing schools under the schemes.  The party said this amounted to a significant amount of Scottish schools\u0026rsquo total resource budget of \u0026pound5.159 billion, and slammed the \u0026ldquoshameful legacy of Labour\u0026rsquos years in power at Holyrood.  In 2016/17, total PFI repayments cost Scotland over \u0026pound1 billion.  SNP MSP Gordon MacDonald said: \u0026ldquoLabour\u0026rsquos toxic PFI legacy means the public purse is still paying heavily over the odds servicing their decade-old debts.  \u0026ldquoThey ought to apologise for their mistakes \u0026ndash which will cost our schools \u0026pound434.3 million this year alone, nearly ten percent of the entire schools budget.  \u0026ldquoMoney that councils could use to pay for teachers, books and facilities is being used by councils forced to pay for Labour\u0026rsquos mistakes.  PFI deals have come under the spotlight in recent years following the shock closure of 17 schools in Edinburgh after a wall collapsed at a primary school.  But Scottish Labour hit out at the \u0026ldquobreath-taking hypocrisy of the SNP, which scrapped the PFI system in 2007 and replaced it with a \u0026ldquonon-profit distributing (NPD) funding model.  The party\u0026rsquos economy spokeswoman Jackie Baillie MSP said: \"Despite campaigning for years to abolish PFI, the SNP simply renamed it. In fact, under the SNP there is now more involvement from the private sector than ever before and the cap on their profits has been removed.  \"Labour has repeatedly called for a wholesale review of public procurement in Scotland - but the SNP joined forces with the Tories to block it. That is shameful.  \"While SNP MSPs polish their brass necks, Labour will come up with the ideas necessary to protect workers and to ensure that taxpayers\u0027 money isn\u0027t going to line the pockets of shareholders.\""},{"url":null,"title":"seeds-of-hope-from-atomic-bomb-site-planted-in-south-ayrshire","story":"  But in the wake of the atomic bomb blast that claimed 140,000 lives, green shoots offered a lifeline to the devastated Japanese city.  Little gingko trees that had been seemingly scorched away to nothing suddenly began to sprout buds from their burnt trunks, going on to become a symbol of hope and courage for Hiroshima and the country at large.  Now 30 \u0026ldquopeace seeds, originating from the \u0026ldquoA-bombed gingko trees of Hiroshima are taking root in Scotland.  They were donated to South Ayrshire by Mayors for Peace, an international organisation - established in 1982 - which brings together cities and places dedicated to the promotion of peace.  It was created by the then Mayor of Hiroshima in response to the deaths from the bomb which fell three months before the end of the Second World War.  Seeds from the trees have been donated to a number of countries and locations, allowing the spirit, hope and courage that stemmed from Hiroshima at that period to be spread across the world.  South Ayrshire\u0026rsquos 30 peace seeds have now been planted by volunteers at Belleisle Conservatory in Ayr and will be looked after there, over the next two years, until the saplings are ready to be planted in the ground.  South Ayrshire Provost, Helen Moonie, was joined by the Consul-General of Japan, Daisuke Matsunaga, to mark the handover and planting of these remarkable seeds.  Consul-General Matsunaga, said: \u0026ldquoHiroshima is very close to my heart. In fact, my wife\u0026rsquos family is originally from Hiroshima, and one of her uncles, who was a 13-year-old schoolboy, perished near the epicentre on the fateful day of 6 August 1945.  \u0026ldquoOn the morning, my mother-in-law was about to go to school. She was 15, and her house was on the outskirts of the city, separated by a hill from the city centre. In the toilet, she saw a flash of light, brighter than broad daylight, and held on to the pillar to withstand the quake. Evidently, something extraordinary had happened. Several hours later, she saw a procession of atomic bomb victims shuffling along to evacuate. They were like zombies in tattered clothes. Townsfolk prepared rice bowls and gave them water.  \u0026ldquoThe following day, the town organised a rescue team, and my mother-in-law was on the team. They walked into the city to help the survivors without knowing anything about radioactivity. Later in her life, she developed thyroid cancer, but fortunately it is now under control.  Of the seeds initiative, he said: \u0026ldquoI highly appreciate the initiative of Mayors for Peace. I truly believe in the power of prayer. If people wishing for peace get together and send out their sincere wishes to the world and the universe, it will surely help us achieve peace. May the ginkgo seeds grow up to be a symbol of this admirable aspiration.  Provost Moonie added: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore proud and privileged to receive this very generous gift from Mayors for Peace, and it was a true honour to be joined by the Consul-General of Japan to mark the planting of these seeds, which travelled almost 6,000 miles to make the journey from Hiroshima to Ayr.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos very humbling to think that the seeds \u0026ndash which originated from the horrors of one of the most devastating events in world history \u0026ndash will grow into truly impressive symbols of peace for all to see.  \u0026ldquoThey will create a legacy for the people and communities of South Ayrshire, and we\u0026rsquoll be working with our schools and young people to get them involved with the project and spread the word about what it means.  \u0026ldquoThe seeds \u0026ndash and the trees they will become \u0026ndash will create a lasting link between South Ayrshire and Japan, and I hope they will grow and blossom just like the friendship between us.  Matsui Kazumi, President of Mayors for Peace and Mayor of Hiroshima, said: \u0026ldquoWe hope from the bottom of our hearts that these seeds \u0026ndash which will grow into second-generation A-bombed trees \u0026ndash will be raised carefully, and that, with the love of many citizens, they will come to serve as a symbol of peace."},{"url":null,"title":"ken-smiths-diary-waspish-comment-monkeying-around-mama-mia","story":"  STILL great weather out there.

Since then customer numbers have soared, with up to 200 hour-long sessions now running each week.                                                    Clients, who suffer from a range of respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and allergies, spend their time relaxing in one of two treatment rooms where the walls and floor are clad in salt. A specialist machine then finely grinds medical grade salt that is released into the air at prescribed concentration levels for the duration of each session.                                                    The therapy, also known as halotherapy, dates back to the ancient Greeks who sought the benefits offered by naturally occurring salt caves for improved health and wellbeing. Providing a 100% natural and drug free complimentary treatment, halotherapy, derived from the Greek alas, meaning \"salt\", is believed to loosen mucus and reduce inflammation making breathing easier.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

All we are now waiting for is confirmation that it’s fully legal and then we can get on with implementing it. Our lawyers have told us that because we are a commercial operation and currently receive no subsidy whatsoever, we have to be 100 per cent sure that this scheme complies otherwise our whole business is at risk. We are not sure why it is taking so long to get simple confirmation.“Although not one penny of the proposed subsidy comes to us, it goes directly to the passenger, we would be forced to pay it all back if it doesn’t comply, that could ruin us and we can’t take that risk. All we are asking for is for the Scottish Government to check that it’s legal with the EU and UK and then we can get on with it. We have written to the new Minister Michael Matheson MSP and invited him to visit the island and meet our staff so we can share our concerns with him directly and hopefully he will visit soon so we can get this unlocked.“We have also today asked for a meeting with our local MSP Liam McArthur to see if he can do anything to get things moving forward on our behalf. This is extremely frustrating but as a family run, fully commercial Orcadian business, employing 70 people and with exciting expansion plans, we cannot put at risk our business until we are certain the Scottish Government’s proposal fully comply.”            \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That is simply not acceptable.Whatever the outstanding disagreement there may be between the government and commercial operators, Mr McArthur feels that people in Orkney have every right to expect both sides to get this sorted without delay.\u0026#8220The Transport Secretary also needs to confirm that the fare reductions, once agreed, will be backdated to 30 June, in keeping with the firm promises made by his predecessor and the First Minister,\u0026#8221 he said.“This sorry saga has rumbled on for far too long. It is time for people in Orkney to get a fair crack of the whip when it comes to RET”.More updates to follow.            \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Garrie Island, in the River Conon, we have fantastic wet alder woodland, which is designated as being important at both a UK and European level.\"However, the woodland habitat has been under threat from invasive species, particularly Himalayan balsam, which spreads so quickly growing in dense stands, meaning no native wildflowers can grow.\"Head teacher Tania Mackie said: \"Outdoor learning is fundamental to the curriculum at Ben Wyvis Primary School, as is working with local partners.\"We are delighted to be working with Cromarty Firth Fishery Board and the SISI project.\"Not only are the children being supported by experts, but the pupils of Ben Wyvis Primary are also learning about their local environment.\"Learning in context is a valuable experience for all our young people and as

Pam\u0026rsquos paintings are absolutely fantastic and we hope this event is a great success.\"Since the age of 63, Pam\u0026nbsphas painted hundreds of pictures, been a member of art groups and exhibited locally.Until recently she also\u0026nbspknitted clothes for infants in the special baby unit at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and was a puzzle enthusiast, winning the Ross-shire Journal crossword at the age of 99.She celebrated her 100th birthday surrounded by friends and family at the Church of Scotland Hall in the village last year after a neighbour of 36 years\u0026rsquo standing, Joyce Fraser, decided to organise something special to mark the milestone event.Mrs Foster was also joined by friends from the local WRI and art group, along with\u0026nbspstaff and residents of the care home she was about to move to.

Her husband passed away in January 2012.Asked the secret of her long life, she said: \"I\u0026rsquove been asked this before and I always say \u0026lsquopure living\u0026rsquo, but of course it\u0026rsquos not!

The move is the first time Scotland’s water quango has acknowledged the severe impact drought conditions are having on the nation’s water supply.            It is also being seen as a possible first step towards mandatory water restrictions, similar to those imposed in Northern Ireland last weekend.Demand for water in Scotland has surged 30 per cent in recent weeks, with customers drawing an extra 140 million litres per day from reservoirs.Pumping stations are said to be working “near to capacity” to satisfy demand.The months of April and May were particularly dry and June ended with a temperature of 33.2C (91F) to record Scotland’s hottest day ever.Now, with no rain on the horizon as far as the middle of this month, water chiefs have issued a public appeal to cut down on the use of dwindling supplies.            The “simple, practical steps” recommend taking showers instead of baths, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants and using a bucket to wash the car.People are also being asked to turn off taps when brushing their teeth and to use washing machines only when they are fully loaded.A dripping tap loses 5,500 litres a year. While taking a bath uses 80 litres, a short shower consumes just a third of that.Peter Farrer, Scottish Water’s Chief Operating Officer, said: “Water usage levels during the current hot summer weather, particularly during peak times, such as morning and early evening, mean we are working around the clock to get water around the system quickly enough.            “Scotland’s public water \u2028supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers. We usually supply more than 1.3 billion litres a day to customers.“We have a strong and resilient distribution network to keep our customers supplied but we’re asking everyone to play their part in helping us as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in many years.“By encouraging simple but important changes to how people use water over the coming days and weeks of dry, warm weather, this will make a big difference to the flow of water around the network and protect supplies.”A hosepipe ban was imposed in Northern Ireland last Friday and has already led to rows.Councils and businesses are exempt from the restrictions and members of the public have been angry at park workers using hoses to water flower beds.            Businesses here have been advised to contact their “licensed provider” for advice.Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said:“Much of Scotland has been enjoying a period of warm and dry weather and, with this forecast to continue, now is a good time for all of us to take action where we can to ensure that we maintain the network’s stocks of water. “Scottish Water is managing current levels of water usage closely, and I encourage people everywhere, whether using water at home, or in their business, to work with Scottish Water and follow their helpful advice and suggestions to use water wisely.“This will allow the network to operate as normal, supporting all our water needs everywhere.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4754753.1528987528!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures how to make your own scottish morning rolls","story":"\t\tMorning rolls are one of Scotland\u0026#8217s best loved foods, Scottish food writer Fraser Wright provides a recipe on how to make your own.\t\t\t\tYou need to start these the night before you want to eat them, however they last well and toast very well too.            What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4763612.1530685998!/image/image.jpg","title":"major incident declared after pair exposed to unknown substance","story":"\t\tA major incident has been declared in Wiltshire after it was suspected two people might have been exposed to an unknown substance in Amesbury.\t\t\t\tThe man and woman, both in their 40s, are in a critical condition at Salisbury District Hospital, Wiltshire Police said.

I’m so tired I could cry. \u2028In the morning, we’re taking my son to Thomas The Tank Engine Land and we decided to drive down on Sunday evening to avoid the traffic.             I don’t want to have to work on what should be the first day of a family holiday, which means pulling an all-nighter, so I can file without missing quality time with my children.            This time last week, I was in another hotel in London. The week before that, Edinburgh. Or was it Salford? Or Dundee? It’s hard to say, if I’m honest. The workload has fried my brain to the point I often cannot recall the prior day’s events when asked what I’ve been up to. I feel like I am losing my mind. Every day bleeds into the next, with no respite in sight. But complaining about the fact I feel like I am on the cliff-edge of a mental health crisis seems utterly futile because, from the outside, it appears I am enjoying wonderful, unprecedented success. Success for which I ought to be grateful.Of course, I am grateful. If anything, I am in a state of permanent disbelief about what is going on. The truth is I haven’t had a minute to reflect on or even savour anything that has happened since November last year when the publication of my book began a chain of events that culminated, last Monday, in being awarded the coveted Orwell Prize.More people than ever seem to want to speak to me, for different reasons. Some just want to say, “well done” and others want to share their stories. Some want to me to come and visit their projects and others want to buy the film and TV rights to my life story.             I did some business in London last week that will make your eyes bulge out of their sockets when its announced, yet somehow, in this haze of physical and emotional exasperation, nothing feels real. I don’t even feel real.READ MORE: Scotsman columnist Darren McGarvey wins Orwell Prize for political writingPeople love a good rags-to-riches story. Hell, I know I do. But imagine how surreal it feels when you become the centre of one. You are suddenly inundated with requests, calls, offers and correspondence, without any frame of reference for what is going on. It’s incredibly disorientating and sometimes frightening, if I’m honest. But there is rarely an opportunity to express that truth, because you are always being prompted to describe how it feels to become “successful”. People want to hear a specific story. The story about a diamond in the rough, escaping poverty, surviving neglect and abuse to become an award-winning author. People are less interested in what it took to get into this position.             The fact I am struggling mentally and emotionally is even less interesting. The details about my cluster migraines, abscesses and insomnia are met with looks of confusion, as people instinctively attempt to direct me away from what I want to say and back to the “narrative”: my capitalist hero-journey. They don’t want to hear about the thousands I’ve spent on hotels, trains and flights, travelling this island by myself, with a heavy bag over my shoulder and a box of books under my arm, literally selling hand-to-hand. The hundreds of books I’ve purchased with my own money, to sign and post all over the world to plug gaping holes in my finances. They don’t want to hear about the anxiety attacks I often experience as notifications flood my devices or the fear I suffer every time I give an interview to a newspaper or broadcaster. Nobody cares that I live in constant dread that I will misspeak on a sensitive issue and become a target for people online. Nobody is interested in me describing what it feels like to come home after weeks of being on the road, to find my two-year old sitting with his back to me – his way of letting me know he isn’t pleased with my absence. I haven’t made a penny off my book yet. I am living off advances. But any time I try to express that these overwhelming mundanities – and not the successes – are what currently consume every moment of my waking life, I feel the weight of other people’s expectations bearing down on me.

I haven’t had a minute to take anything in. I run around like a mad-man, I fall asleep somewhere, and I wake up and do it all again. Every. Single. Day. No matter who I speak to, my constant refrain – that I am in urgent need of rest and fear I may be heading for a fall – never seems to be heard. The only thing I haven’t been offered in the last seven days is a good night’s sleep. I feel obligated to so many people, for different reasons, that my own needs fall to the bottom of the hierarchy of concern. My problems are marked as low-priority and so must remain hidden, revealed only in late-night social media outbursts when I feel trapped on Scotland’s decrepit public transportation network.All I need is a few days where I am not expected to do anything. Where I am not obligated to speak to anybody. Where I can gather my thoughts and rejuvenate after two years of non-stop, high-pressure work, couched in constant financial insecurity and stress. Anybody getting any ideas that I’m too far removed from the working class to write about it, ought to refer to my seven-day-a-week schedule for proof that I am more working class now than I ever was – with no holiday entitlement.

This is what I have tried to do in my book, Scots and Catalans. Union and Disunion, a comparative  history of two peoples without states of their own, whose attempts to define, reassess and perhaps transform their relationship to the larger polities to which they belong has been drawing headlines across the world.             The book begins with the Middle Ages and ends in December 2017 after the flight to Belgium of the Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont, following the failure of a unilateral bid to break away from the Spanish state and establish Catalonia as an independent republic.Many years ago I wrote a study of the origins of the Catalan rebellion of 1640 against the royal government in Madrid – a rebellion that inspired the creation of a Catalan republic which lasted for a week. As I contemplated the unfolding of today’s Catalan separatist movement and the simultaneous rise of Scottish separatism, I thought it might be illuminating to attempt a sustained comparison of the historical experience of the two countries and of the ways in which a sense of national identity has manifested itself over the centuries.READ MORE: Kenny MacAskill: Stop treating Catalonia as a proxy for ScotlandNaturally there are important differences between the two national histories, but differences can be as revealing as similarities in reaching historical conclusions. One obvious difference is that Scotland was for centuries an independent kingdom, whereas Catalonia was never a truly independent state. It was a principality that formed part of a federation, the Crown of Aragon, which was united with the Crown of Castile as a result of the marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile in 1469. This dynastic union created the country that came to be known as ‘Spain’. Dynastic union between Scotland and England came more than a century later, when James VI of Scotland’s inheritance of the English throne in 1603 created ‘Great Britain’.  The immediate effect of these unions was similar, in the sense that, although both Scotland and Catalonia preserved their traditional forms of government, they were now linked to a far more powerful neighbour. This produced inevitable tensions, and at the start of the 18th century attempts were made to resolve them, although in very different ways. The 1707 Anglo-Scottish Union created a British parliamentary monarchy, in which the Scots surrendered their Edinburgh parliament in exchange for access to England’s expanding commercial and colonial empire.             In 1716, following the surrender of Barcelona two years earlier to the forces of Philip V, who was the monarch of the newly enthroned Bourbon dynasty, Catalonia, like the rest of the Crown of Aragon, was stripped of its traditional laws and liberties, and was merged into what became an authoritarian monarchical Spain.Scotland and Catalonia both benefited economically from the constitutional changes of the early 18th century, although the expansion of Britain’s overseas empire gave the Scots many more opportunities than those enjoyed by the Catalans. The British empire of the 18th and 19th centuries was a joint Anglo-Scottish creation, whereas the Catalans remained on the margins of Spain’s long-established American empire. Instead, they turned their energies to economic development, and became the pioneers of Spanish industrialisation, based on a rapidly growing textile industry. READ MORE: Brian Wilson: Catalonia is evidence of the benefits of a UnionScotland, too, was being transformed by the growth of its industries in the same period, but, unlike Catalonia, it never became the main power-house of the wider, national, economy. The long-term effect of these differences is still to be seen. In Spain, economic and political development were out of kilter in the 19th and early 20th centuries. While Madrid was the country’s political capital, its economic capital was Barcelona. In Britain, London was both.            In the 19th century, Catalonia’s relationship with the government in Madrid soured. This was partly the result of Spain’s chronic political instability in the decades following the Napoleonic invasion and the Peninsular War. But it can also be explained by a pan-European phenomenon, the emergence of a new-style nationalism inspired by the Romantic Movement. The researches of historians, literary scholars and folklorists into the origins of their societies generated a sense of the nation as an organic community with its own distinctive characteristics. Such explorations of the Catalan past helped produce another significant difference between Scotland and Catalonia. It was language that became the point of reference for national identity in Catalonia, in a way that Gaelic would never be for that of Scotland. The Catalans clung to their language when the repressive regime of General Franco sought to replace it with Castilian, the predominant language of Spain. After Franco’s death in 1975, a reaction was inevitable. The autonomous Catalan regime created by the 1978 Constitution of the newly democratic Spain was determined, through its control of the educational system, to ‘Catalanise’ Catalan society in the face of the encroachment of Castilian through the national media. The resulting linguistic question has played a large part in creating the current impasse between Catalonia and the Spanish government.It is one of the ironies of this stand-off that the 30 years between 1978 and the financial collapse of 2008 have been the most prosperous and successful in Catalonia’s colourful history. But the economic crisis gave radical Catalan nationalists a chance to depict Catalonia as the victim of a malign Spanish state, and the inflexibility of a Spanish government determined to treat the secessionist movement as a constitutional question that should properly be left to the courts handed the separatists a propaganda victory that they have exploited to the full. Referendums, whether authorised or unauthorised, as in the Catalan case, are at best blunt instruments for determining the will of the people. In forcing binary choices they can be deeply divisive, and Catalonia is now a bitterly divided society, in which intimidation is being exercised by secessionists who claim to speak for all its inhabitants.

Mr Elliot went public with the draft findings, which have not been published, late on Tuesday night. The Electoral Commission said Vote Leave had taken an \"unusual step\" of going public with the findings of its draft report.            If found guilty of breaking electoral law, the campaign could be fined. Allegations against the official Brexit campaign centre on a donation of almost £680,000 made by the campaign to a youth Brexit group called BeLeave.It is alleged that the two groups coordinated on strategy, and that money was used to pay data firm Aggregate IQ for targeted messaging services that benefited Vote Leave. If the funds had been recorded as Vote Leave expenditure, it would have taken the campaign\u0027s spending over a £7 million limit, breaching electoral law.The Electoral Commission has investigated the allegations twice before. However, new information was provided by whistleblowers including Christopher Wylie and Shahmir Sanni. Mr Wylie worked for Cambridge Analytica, the data firm at the centre of the Facebook privacy scandal, while Mr Sanni worked with Vote Leave.According to the BBC, Vote Leave now admit that there was email correspondence between the donor who made the donation to BeLeave and Dominic Cummings, the Vote Leave director.Mr Cummings is facing a rare charge of being in contempt of parliament for refusing to appear before a Commons committee holding an inquiry into \u0027fake news\u0027.            Mr Elliot accused the EC of a \"huge breach of natural justice\", alleging that the watchdog had not listened to Vote Leave\u0027s version of events.He told Sky News: \"Their initial conclusion is that we have overspent, that a donation we made to another group during the course of the campaign was incorrect, we shouldn\u0027t have made that donation.\"\"[The Electoral Commission] listened to these, quite frankly marginal characters who came out in March, and listened to their stories, but haven\u0027t had evidence from Vote Leave side of things.\"I think it is a huge breach of natural justice that they haven\u0027t wanted to listen to our opinions and our story and we were the people running the campaign.\"            In an interview with the BBC he said: \"I believe we acted both within the letter of the law and also the spirit of the law and the spirit of how you should conduct a campaign.\"We got the designation, Vote Leave, as the officially designated campaign for Leave, on the basis that we would be working with other groups - we wouldn\u0027t just solely be working on our own, we would work alongside other groups and encourage them, and encourage their activities.\"READ MORE: SNP MP: ‘Dismiss Scottish people’s voice on Brexit at your peril’An Electoral Commission spokesman said: \"The commission has concluded its investigation and having reached initial findings provided Vote Leave with a 28-day period to make any further or new representations. That period ended on Tuesday 3 July.\"The unusual step taken by Vote Leave in sharing its views on the Electoral Commission\u0027s initial findings does not affect the process set out in law.\"The commission will give due consideration to the representations made to the commission, including those made by other campaigners under investigation.            \"We will then, at the earliest opportunity, publish a thorough and detailed closing report in order to provide a full and balanced account to the public and to Parliament.\""},{"url":null,"title":"tired old games jamie halcro johnston ","story":"Regrettably, Humza Yousaf has once again chosen to play politics and attack MSPs who have stood up for the interests of Orkney and Shetland at Holyrood while he and his SNP colleagues were trying for months to pretend that their long-standing commitment to fair funding did not exist.\nThere is little doubt that, without this issue being raised up the political agenda, the SNP would have dropped their pledge to the people of the islands like a stone. So it is a shame that Mr Yousaf continues to play the same tired old games, even after the commendable efforts of councillors and MSPs of all parties and none has secured at least some action towards correcting this patently unfair situation.\nThe transport minister is right in congratulating the island councils for their tenacity in pursuing this issue. It\u0026#8217s just a shame it was the actions – or inactions – of his SNP government which forced them to be so tenacious.\nAnd what is now abundantly clear is that, in spite of the SNP\u0026#8217s protests, the money was always available to address this issue. The SNP managed to magic up an extra £170 million yesterday which, apparently, they didn\u0026#8217t have when the budget was first presented. So the question many in the Northern Isles should be asking Mr Yousaf is why didn\u0026#8217t the SNP include fair funding in their draft budget in the first place?\nWhen SNP ministers were trying to dismiss fair funding, I was regularly questioning them in the Scottish Parliament on their commitment. I was meeting with representatives from the island councils – in Lerwick, in Kirkwall and in Edinburgh.\nI put forward the amendment which, accepted by the entire Scottish Parliament (including Mr Yousaf and the SNP), recognised the lifeline nature of our internal ferries. And I wrote to Mr Yousaf and to his boss, Nicola Sturgeon, on the issue.\nSo I suppose it is flattering that, of all the opposition MSPs who voted against the SNP Budget, Mr Yousaf has chosen to single me out in this way for his faux outrage. I would suggest it\u0026#8217s an indication of the effectiveness of my consistent and vocal opposition to the SNP\u0026#8217s attempt to sweep its own fair funding pledge under the carpet.\nAnd in relation to the vote itself, Mr Yousaf seems intent on misleading Shetlanders. The truth is that MSPs do not vote on individual parts of the budget, but rather on the budget as a whole.\nSo, even with the late U-turn on additional ferry funding, this budget remains, overall, a disappointing budget for people and businesses in Shetland. It will mean that many of my constituents – in fact, anyone earning over £26,000 per year – will pay more tax.\nIt will hit the incomes of local people and businesses, something numerous business organisations have warned will harm Scotland\u0026#8217s already sluggish economic growth. And it leaves our local councils across the region still having to make tough spending decisions. So it is for those local and regional MSPs who supported the SNP\u0026#8217s budget to defend their decision. I simply wasn\u0026#8217t prepared to back a budget which will leave too many local people out of pocket.\nAnd an inconvenient fact Mr Yousaf, too busy patting himself on the back for belatedly delivering something even the SNP in Orkney accept was always an SNP commitment, choses to ignore is that this is only a deal for this year and not a long term solution. So the real risk is that we will have to go through this process all over again for next year\u0026#8217s budget.\nI hope next year, the SNP will deliver a long term settlement on fair funding, not another one off. That a long-term solution will be found that will meet the needs of the local communities so reliant on these lifeline links. And that Mr Yousaf, Derek Mackay and the SNP will avoid the political theatrics that have dominated this year\u0026#8217s budget process.\n Edinburgh.\n If all politicians behaved in this manner it is likely that every budget in every parliament would fail, even though every single clause had enthusiastic and popular local backing no one was willing to support the package as a whole.\n Clearly these are not the section of his constituents Mr Halcro \u0026#8211 Johnston is interested in.\n The tartan Tories are living up to their name for sure and their blind supporters still try to defend them.\nMr Halcrow objects to political parties playing games?\n\nWhich party does Christopher \u0026#8216up-skirting\u0026#8217 Chope belong to again?\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct.

One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf.
