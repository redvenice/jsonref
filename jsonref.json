Is there, for a novelist, a wariness about it?BE: The interesting thing is that I’m not usually called a political writer. And I am a political writer! There is a political underpinning to\u0026nbspGirl, Woman, Other, which is to explore as many black British women as possible in a single novel. The intention is for the reader to enjoy the book on the level of story, but at the same time, they’re engaging with all these issues. This is my eighth book, and all of them have been very political in terms of the ideas, the context of my characters and the subversive way in which I’m exploring the Afro-diasporic experience and black British history and society. But the context for my work has altered. After I won the Booker in October, everything changed. People are reading my book now, irrespective of the labels that are imposed on it. So, I’m not concerned that seeing it as “political fiction” will challenge people to such an extent that they won’t want to read it.\u0026nbspAG: Orwell’s aim was “to make political writing into an art”. Do you think this ambition hints at the slight delicateness around what is literature and what is political tract, and the need to disguise the political message in something that is valuable in its own right?BE: If we think of politics with a small “p” in terms of power relationships and hierarchies, then I think we could categorise most literature as political. But what I’m doing is writing a book about black women and stating it as such – that’s not really the case when you’re talking about white writers. Is it not political, for example, for a white male writer to write books only from the perspective of white, middle-aged, heterosexual, middle-class men? To me that is a very political act, but we never look at it like that. When I’m writing about black British women, it’s seen as very consciously being about blackness. Which it is. But it becomes something that we’re beaten up with – the idea that we are somehow writing about social issues and politics, and therefore it is not real art.Obviously it’s very different for you, because you’re a journalist, so your mission with your journalism and your book is to educate people. So how does politics play out in your work?AG: As journalists, we’re meant to be objective. We’re not meant to reveal anything about our own politics, we’re meant to be asking questions and giving a voice to people who otherwise aren’t able to directly seize the attention of politicians and people in power. That’s what I think I’ve done in my book and why I really wanted to write it. A lot of issues in\u0026nbspThe Windrush Betrayal\u0026nbspwere highlighted in the  and attracted a political response in 2018. But the importance of putting it in a book is to make sure that people really understand the long roots of the problems that caused the Windrush scandal, and have a bit more time to engage with the very complicated and very different stories of so many people affected.BE: There are connections between what we both do, because I’m deeply interested in history. In your book you go back and explore imperialism and colonialism because you need people to understand the situation we’re in today, which I think is one of its strengths. We need to understand the foundations of Britain’s relationship to its former colonies.AG: I was really interested to see the report into what caused the Windrush scandal, written by Wendy Williams. One of the key findings was that ministers and Home Office officials had very little understanding about Britain’s colonial history and our immigration laws going back throughout the 20th century. So she called on the Home Office to begin a whole programme of education for its workers and ministers. And that’s in part what I’m trying to do in this book, because you can’t understand why this whole mess happened without knowing that, in 1948, a system of free movement was created between people in Commonwealth countries and Britain people were invited to come here, and it was only gradually, through increasingly restrictive immigration legislation, that their position invisibly moved from being legal to being illegalised. Ministers themselves just weren’t aware of this, which is why when all of the hostile environment policies began to be introduced, there was so little knowledge of the catastrophic consequences they could have.BE: It is shocking though, isn’t it, to think that people working in government don’t understand recent history? We have the Black Lives Matter movement and still, today, people don’t understand Britain’s involvement in the slave trade. That’s why it’s so important that it should be taught.AG: Well, one of the most amazing parts of the reporting for this book, for me, was going to Jamaica and meeting a lot of politicians and historians there who were still feeling quite wounded by the relatively recent visit of David Cameron in 2015. He went over there and was surprised to be asked by a lot of people about whether or not Britain was considering paying reparations for slavery. And I think he just hadn’t realised that was still a topic for discussion.BE: Winsome, one of the characters that are more familiar to people, is somebody who comes to Britain in the 1950s, and she is the only Windrush-generation character in the book. Until the Windrush scandal blew up through your journalism, I had no idea this was going on . If I had known, I would have created Winsome as a character who is forced to go back to Barbados. She’s perhaps one of the more familiar characters to people. So to have everything taken away from her at the end, and to have her feeling confused, betrayed and powerless, would have been very impactful.AG: Tell me a bit about the 12 characters. Because you were quite explicit in saying that you wanted to bring 12 very different characters into the light who haven’t frequently been part of British fiction.BE: I wanted to expand the representation of who we are in this country, rather than define it or reduce it. They are aged 19 to 93 and every generation in between, and that was really important. Some of them are migrants who have come from another place. A lot of them are born in Britain, because I wanted to make the point about people who were born here and raised here and this being the only country they know. I also decided that the women could not all be straight, because that’s not true to life. A quarter of the protagonists are on the queer spectrum. Class came into the book without me even thinking about it, because I was exploring a number of women who start their lives at the bottom of the ladder and then work their way up. I was also keen to explore a wide range of black women who live in a society where there are certain perceptions of who they are based on stereotypes. So, one character, Bummi, is a cleaner but she has a degree in maths. Her daughter Carole goes to Oxford and becomes a banker.BE: No! No, Carole wouldn’t. Carole is somebody who has sold herself to the corporate world. She’s left her working-class origins behind in order to succeed. Amma, who is the theatre director, is a lesbian and a radical activist – she would have been out marching.AG: Carole might have been watching the news and thinking about it.BE: You’re being too kind to Carole! Carole’s on a very narrow path to success. Amma and her daughter Yazz would be marching, and probably MeganMorgan, the non-binary figure too, but I think that’s probably it.When you were writing your book and your articles, you were encountering people who were just being seen as numbers. They had been dehumanised. That ties in directly with my project as a writer, because there are so few portrayals of people of colour, particularly black people and black women, in our fictional world. So, how did you bring people to life?AG: The need to have people’s human experiences was obvious to me right from the beginning, because a lot of the policy problems that lie behind everything having gone wrong are incredibly complicated, very head-spinning, quite boring if you’re not engaged with Home Office policy issues, and, to be frank, quite hard to get anyone excited about. And in that way, I think I was fortunate that the first person I interviewed about all of this had had such an extreme experience. That was a woman called Paulette Wilson who had been here for 50 years, who’d come from Jamaica as a child, who was twice arrested and sent to Yarl’s Wood detention centre and who was about to be deported to Jamaica. It was really important to explain to readers the details of her life so that they could understand that this wasn’t just a minor error by the Home Office, but a really staggering mistake that they had made.BE: As a writer, I know what my intention is and there’s a lot of freedom in terms of how I express it. But I don’t really know how my work is going to be received or its impact. It’s very different, for you: there is a goal, especially with this, wasn’t there?AG: There was a goal: to make the Home Office and ministers realise that there was a huge problem. Even though we’ve had two years now of apologies from ministers, there’s still a refusal to engage with the legislation that underpins all of these issues.How do you feel about the impact of your work, having won the Booker and being No 1 on the bestseller lists?BE: I love the fact that my work is out there and being read by so many people. That gives me such joy. I have been publishing since 1994, and I really wasn’t reaching many people. And now I am. And I’m reaching them with a radical, experimental book, about 12 primarily black British women. And the fact that I got to No 1 in the paperback hit parade, and won the Booker, might mean that the doors finally do open to a bigger number and variety of writers and genres. Next year I’ll start writing a new book.

How long these drivers can remain positive depends much more broadly on the jobs market moving forward with cliff edges seen as the furlough scheme winds down and some consumers face claiming universal credit instead of their government-supported wage.”Petrol sales also played a part in the recovery after the biggest fall in consumption on record in April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a488976bac790e54d68b2ed88df5c644d7426b90/0_17_3079_1848/master/3079.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0952561e6b81fb5aac0b927c159ec074","title":"john lewis to reopen a further nine stores on 25 june full list coronavirus","story":"Full list of more shops the retailer plans to reopen after coronavirus shutdownJohn Lewis is to reopen nine further shops next week in addition to 13 it opened this week.The department store chain will reopen at Cribbs Causeway, Leeds, Liverpool, Milton Keynes, Newcastle, Southampton, Tunbridge Wells and York on Thursday 25 June. The group’s Peter Jones shop in Chelsea, London, will also open on the same day. It will take the total number of its stores open to 22, nearly half of the group’s 50 outlets.Bérangère Michel, the director of customer service at John Lewis’s parent group, said: “The overwhelmingly positive feedback from both customers and partners on our first 13 department store reopenings this week has given us confidence to open in more locations.“We found that in some shops we were able to increase the number of customers and still maintain robust social distancing.”The company will provide hand sanitiser and limit the number of shoppers in store, in line with government guidelines for the reopening of non-essential retail in England during the coronavirus pandemic.Changing rooms will remain closed and beauty services are suspended but John Lewis said shoppers would be able to lie on beds and try on and test wipeable products such as sunglasses, prams and tech products.“Although we are not able to offer every single experience that we used to, we are still managing to offer customers a really varied shopping experience that is as close to normal and as enjoyable as we can possibly make it,” Michel said.The latest reopenings come as retailers hope shoppers will snap up summer stock that has been languishing in stores and warehouses throughout the sunny spring season after clothing and footwear retailers were forced to close their doors when the UK went into lockdown in March.While shoppers queued up at chains such as Primark, Zara and Sports Direct when stores reopened on Monday, it is clear that there has not been a sustained surge back to shopping centres and high streets this week.Department stores are expected to be among the slowest to recover from the downturn because their large shops rely on services including cafes and beauty treatments – which are still closed – to draw in the crowds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f65f04fe8f24007254a70bdd5fd2103549638233/14_392_6680_4008/master/6680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=325f2891f718c2b1eb01576145f00882","title":"the 12 per cent rise in uk retail spending should come with note of caution coronavirus","story":"Jump seems consistent with idea of V-shaped economic recovery but is too soon to tellNor should retail sales be confused with consumer spending. Retail sales are the goods that people buy, either in the shops or online. Consumer spending includes services such as eating out in restaurants or staying in hotels – and those bits of the economy remain shuttered.Retail sales account for only about a third of overall consumer spending and there is, as Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Consulting notes, every possibility that some of the money that would have been spent on services was instead spent on retail goods. He gives the example of people using the money saved from gym memberships to buy fitness equipment instead.Back then, of course, the debt ratio was coming down from the much higher levels caused by the borrowing during the second world war. Record levels of peacetime borrowing and a rising debt ratio make the treasury uncomfortable, which is why the furlough scheme is being tapered from the start of August and will be wound up in October.The big unknown is whether households are going to carry on spending as the wage subsidies are removed and unemployment continues to rise. If they do, the chances of a V-shaped recession will be greatly improved – but it is premature to say that they will."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c0b5ee7f8f8123812a8015d386ebf89ca7ab391/0_71_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84d05535bdbf915cb7ac63831a4d3321","title":"three meat factories in england and wales closed over coronavirus","story":"More than 100 staff test positive in West Yorkshire, Anglesey and WrexhamThree large meat factories have closed in England and Wales after more than 100 workers tested positive for coronavirus.Mobile testing tents have been set up outside an Asda-owned meat processing site in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire, after several workers fell ill with Covid-19.The Kober plant, which supplies bacon to Asda supermarkets, has closed until next week and around 100 contacts of workers have been traced. It was unclear on Friday how many workers had tested positive for the coronavirus.On Thursday the UK’s main supplier of supermarket chicken, 2 Sisters Food Group, said it was closing its huge Anglesey plant for 14 days after 58 people tested positive for coronavirus.In Wrexham, 38 staff have tested positive at Rowan Foods, which makes food for supermarkets across the UK. Bosses said the cases reflected an increase in the local area rather than a spread within the site.The cluster of new cases in meat processing plants will raise concerns about a potential outbreak similar to those seen in France and the US. In the latter, as many as 5,000 meat and poultry workers have contracted Covid-19, according to an estimate last month by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The confined working conditions and long periods spent by workers in close proximity – often 10 to 12 hours per shift – mean meat factories are at substantially heightened risk of spreading the coronavirus through human-to-human transmission, the CDC has said.Unions have said the living conditions of many low-paid workers in the factories is another contributing factor, as is time spent by colleagues in communal spaces such as locker rooms and shuttle buses.In the UK, four meat factories are reported to have been affected to date. Three workers died from coronavirus after a small outbreak at a meat processing plant in South Yorkshire last month.The family member of one of those who died accused Cranswick, the company that owns the plant, of failing to adequately protect workers, citing a lack of face masks, lack of physical distancing, and the provision of only the statutory sick pay of £95.85 a week for those too ill to work. Cranswick said it had rigorous cleaning procedures, that distancing had been in place in the plant since the middle of March, and that visors were now available for anyone who wanted to use them.A  analysis last month found that almost half of the Covid-19 hotspots in the US were linked to plants where poultry, pigs and cattle are slaughtered and packaged. The outbreaks led to calls for urgent reforms to an industry beset by health and safety issues.The United Food and Commercial Workers union said recently that at least 44 slaughterhouse workers in the US had died from the virus and another 3,000 had tested positive, lower than the CDC estimate.Public health officials in Germany are grappling with an outbreak among hundreds of workers at a meatpacking plant in Rheda-Wiedenbrueck. At least 730 workers have tested positive at the Toennies Group plant, it emerged on Thursday. Germany’s agriculture minister called for an official investigation into the outbreak."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71ace7f4d865fdef31303c1a1093add79f786110/0_48_4649_2789/master/4649.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7d2abbb3062271bae886409db9d8585","title":"watchdog investigates possible overcharging for hand sanitiser in uk","story":"Four unnamed stores suspected by competition regulator of profiteering during Covid-19 crisisThe competition watchdog is to investigate suspected profiteering by four pharmacies and convenience stores for over-charging shoppers for hand sanitiser during the coronavirus pandemic.Stocks of hand sanitiser were among the first items the British public cleared off the shelves as the coronavirus pandemic took hold in the UK. The Competition and Markets Authority, which announced the investigations, has previously identified hand sanitiser as the product suffering the biggest price hike.The coronavirus lockdown has prompted some of the UK’s most prominent companies to announce large-scale job losses. The aviation, automotive and retail sectors have been among the worst hit, as businesses adjust to dramatically reduced revenue projections.While the government’s job retention scheme has so far protected millions of jobs, fears are mounting that unemployment will rise as the scheme begins to be phased out from August.Since lockdown began on 23 March, some of the UK’s largest companies have announced plans to cut a total of 60,000 jobs globally, many of which will fall in the UK.Rolls-Royce - 9,000 jobsThe jet-engine manufacturer has confirmed that\u0026nbsp3,000 job cuts, of a planned 9,000 worldwide, will be made in the UK.

The BP chief executive, Bernard Looney, said that the majority of people affected would be those in office-based jobs, including at the most senior levels. BP said it would reduce the number of group leaders by a third, and protect the “frontline” of the company, in its operations.Centrica- 5,000 jobsThe owner of British Gas announced in June that it intends to cut 5,000 jobs, mostly senior roles, and remove three layers of management, in a bid to simplify the structure of its business. The energy firm has a total workforce of 27,000, of whom 20,000 are in the UK.Bentley- 1,000 jobsThe luxury carmaker intends to\u0026nbspshrink its workforce by almost a quarter, slashing 1,000 roles through a voluntary redundancy scheme.

The CMA has not reached a view on whether there is sufficient evidence of an infringement of competition law for it to issue a statement of objections to any of the parties under investigation.”The CMA did not name the companies involved.Last month, Marks \u0026amp Spencer was accused of exploiting the Covid-19 pandemic by selling bottles of hand sanitiser for twice as much as equivalents elsewhere. The supermarket chain advertised 500ml bottles in stores for £11.50, after initially accidentally pricing them at £15. Another brand’s bottle of the same amount of hand sanitiser was available at Boots for £4.15.The CMA taskforce on coronavirus-related issues said it has been contacted more than 60,000 times between 10 March and 17 May.In April, the CMA sent advisory or warning letters to 187 firms after receiving 2,500 complaints about large price rises on food and personal hygiene products such as hand sanitiser. As of 21 May that number had reached 7,000.The CMA said that since mid-April, the biggest source of complaints had been about cancellations and refunds relating to holidays, with consumers dissatisfied with their treatment by some airlines and travel companies. In May, cancellations accounted for three-quarters of all complaints to the CMA, with nearly 20,000 by 21 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdebc0aff7a9fb21747eafb0f09960b57587326f/0_118_3737_2242/master/3737.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8114be12987a0691aafa300787e45ec8","title":"labour report ed miliband","story":"People want fundamental change. Yet our new report shows they must believe we can deliver it• Ed Miliband is a former leader of the Labour partyThis is a moment of profound economic and social distress for the country. Bold action is desperately required to cope with the crisis. Yet we are six months on from another election that Labour lost badly.This is the backdrop for the Labour Together report on the 2019 defeat, which we are publishing tomorrow. Our report is clear that the party cannot abandon its commitment to bold economic transformation – indeed we believe there is a winning coalition to be built for it. To deliver that transformation, Labour must learn the deep lessons about why the public did not believe in the change we offered in 2019 and the deep roots of our defeat.There is a broad consensus about the immediate reasons for our defeat. Just like when I lost in 2015, issues of leadership mattered so, too, did the dramatic wedge that Brexit drove through our coalition and a sense that, whatever the popularity of inidual policies, our manifesto package as a whole was not seen as credible.However, our report concludes that these issues conceal much deeper forces. In 2019, the so-called red wall crumbled but the bricks had been gradually loosening over a long period through a combination of industrial change and alienation from the Westminster party. In the seats we lost in 2019, such as North West Durham and Rother Valley, the gap between the Tories and us had been closing for two decades.At the same time as we have lost our old heartlands, we have a new core vote, of younger graduates, mostly in our big cities. But they are not enough on their own to win us the election. Every leftwing party across Europe is facing a similar challenge, often recording historically low vote shares.The deeper forces that have led us to this point require deep thinking to lead us out, as Keir Starmer has said. Our task is to build a new coalition of younger, metropolitan voters, along with those in our former core vote who deserted us over time, as well as swing voters, including those in the south of England.Listening to voters does not lead to abandoning a belief in economic transformation. We are clear that people want real, profound change and Labour must be the agent of it.The party conducted detailed polling analysis of hundreds of thousands of people and organised a citizens’ jury, bringing together town-dwelling leave voters who had left us and urban remainers who had stayed. The shared concerns included investing in public services such as the NHS and education building social housing and creating decent jobs and fair taxation and redistribution.This sentiment for big economic change was seen in the Brexit referendum, among millions of leavers who felt neglected by politics and wanted an economic transformation that spoke to their community and town. This desire is still evident among leave and remain voters.Since my defeat in 2015, I have learned lessons about the appetite for greater boldness compared to what I offered. Today, the lessons from 2019 are that we must have change that people can believe in. People simply did not buy into the idea that the transformation we were promising last December would be delivered. Whatever our good intentions, if people think change won’t happen, they won’t vote for us.Winning the case for change is also about the work done in the years between elections, not the months before. Our report recommends that we use every part of our movement to rebuild the bonds that link us to voters. Unless we make our politics more relational, less transactional, we will be deeply vulnerable to simplistic, populist arguments from the other side.Our organisation and campaigning is not fit for purpose: our methods still owe more to the 1990s than the 2020s. And while we prided ourselves on digital innovation in 2017, the Conservatives were miles ahead of us last year. A top-to-bottom transformation is required.To make the most of our wider movement, we must put aside the factionalism and ision of recent years. We owe it to the people whom we represent to look outwards to the country rather than inwards.There is no consolation in defeat – only a country that has grown more unequal, more unfair and more ided. The Herculean task of winning the next election will require vision, imagination, discipline and unity. Every part of our movement must be part of it. We hope our report can be a starting point not just for winning an election but what really matters: a radical transformation of our country.• Ed Miliband is shadow business secretary and former leader of the Labour party"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60b6b521f7c0acb4f44872dbb254ee8398edbce8/0_287_8660_5199/master/8660.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c62e50395e0663a57bcc2590825f736","title":"i thought i was coping with lockdown but suddenly everythings going wrong","story":"A wrecked laptop, a collapsing ceiling: it’s getting harder to pretend I’m on top of things My dad died more than 15 years ago, so the details of that week are a little sketchy, but it went like this. I had only recently passed my driving test and I didn’t yet have any idea how long driving took – I basically thought I was in a Harrier jump jet. I made myself so late for some unmemorable obligation that I was trying to do my mascara while driving, missed a give-way line until seconds before, braked suddenly and got rammed from behind by a driver whose fault it categorically was not (whatever the rules say).I got towed to a garage, was super-late for whatever it was I had been rushing to, left whatever I had bought in the boot of my totalled vehicle and never saw it again, got given a replacement car and ran out of petrol in the fast lane of a lesser-spotted five-lane segment of motorway and, narrowly escaping with not only my own life but also those of most of my siblings, had to get towed again. What were the chances, I railed to the skies, that in what was already the worst week of my life I would also end up on the back of a flatbed truck on two occasions?Here is some crucial wisdom, from one middle-aged adult to any adults who are slightly younger or have had a less mishap-strewn life: the chances were really high. When something like this happens, it is neither karma nor coincidence: it is you. You are having the problems because you are the problem. It is like “You are not stuck in traffic, you are traffic”, only worse, because at least then there are other people suffering with you. It is nature’s way of telling you that you are tired and you should stop doing things, only, because nature is an incredibly quiet and subtle messenger, you will already have mucked a bunch of stuff up before you hear her.I took it to my reputable local computer-mender, where they were signalling their one-person-at-a-time coronavirus policy by keeping their security shutters half-drawn, so you had to crouch down to get in, like the lift in Being John Malkovich. I managed that perfectly, even gracefully, on the way in and we had a nice catchup – I know them pretty well from all the times I have smashed my phone – and talked a bit about water damage, until one of them said: “Why does it smell like beer?”I noticed, on my return, that the ceiling in the living room was wet and chalked this up to yet more beer, soaking through the floorboards. This was a complete overestimation of how much damage the last dregs of a single beer bottle can do, not to mention a radical misunderstanding of the layout of the house, in which the bedroom is not above the living room.It transpired a day later that there was a leak, which had by now done all the damage in the world. The ceiling was sagging like a hammock and there was the ominous smell of plaster that really wanted to succumb to gravity. “Definitely don’t sit underneath it,” said the plumber who arrived the next day. I thought: “Huh, what kind of idiot does he take me for?” But when it came to the bit where he disappeared for parts, and I tried and failed to find my phone so I could pay him, it turned out – this bit of deductive reasoning took a really long time – that I had stored my phone, carefully, at the bottom of the outdoors recycling bin.I saw, or thought I saw, a lot of thoughts running across his face: who does that? Is this some elaborate grift, where she borrows my phone to find her own, then somehow escapes with my van and all my tools that I don’t leave in there overnight? Or is this simply a person in a high state of tension because parts of her house are falling down?It is just enough, is what it is. This isn’t nature’s way of telling me to sleep more. This is nature’s way of telling me to stop saying: “Fine, actually – I don’t mind it,” whenever anyone asks me how lockdown is going. Because the true answer is something different from that, something that does not sound like words, just a string of consonants, not even looking for a vowel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5ddea272531837a8e45b090245d4ce4e9d92ea2/0_37_5470_3282/master/5470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ef7613d21eaaf01027dd9bc5a77a69b","title":"proud scientist sage secretive advice","story":"The group has published much of its advice - but it’s not there to make political judgments about how this advice gets used• Ian Boyd is a contributor to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies Some of my earliest memories are of wanting to study science. It has been a privilege to have had the opportunity to make this my career, and it has been a pursuit in search of making the world a better place.Scientific research is built on the idea of learning from mistakes in order to come closer to the truth. It involves a combination of ambitious conjectures, blunt criticism and humble admissions of error. Misunderstandings arise when the scientific method meets social and political intolerances uncertainty and doubt can be interpreted as a sign of weakness or vacillation.Right now, during one of the most serious pandemics in recorded history, this mismatch has serious implications. Those who have looked to science for answers may be confused: rather than asserting facts, science is about understanding and narrowing down uncertainty. There have been mischaracterisations of the scientific advice informing the government’s coronavirus response, and of the researchers involved.The scientists involved in this endeavour are legitimate subjects of critique and scrutiny, but it’s worrying to see the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) – a largely voluntary group of scientists who have spent the last few months crunching data and giving free, frank, politically neutral and objective advice – described in increasingly sinister terms, from “opaque” to “secretive” – and even “like a virtual black box”. These are unjustified descriptions.In past emergencies, such as the Ebola and Zika viruses, evidence from Sage has been published when the group finally stood down. At the time, this was a reasonable approach. Coronavirus is different, so Sage has published its workings and advice, albeit with a time lag between its production and publication. As the group exists to inform government, it’s right that the government should be the first to receive its advice. Some have suggested that publication could be quicker, but we’ve learned during this fast-moving situation that hindsight is the cheapest commodity for critics.The scientists involved in Sage are sensitive to this criticism, but it will not ert them from providing their best advice with as much transparency as can be mustered in the time available, so long as this doesn’t undermine the very purpose of the group. Aside from serving public interest, transparency sharpens and improves scientific thinking.In the past four weeks, more than 300 pieces of evidence have been published from the efforts of hundreds of scientists who make contributions to Sage in some form. The people who produce this material, and who attend Sage meetings, are doing this out of a sense of duty rather than pleasure. They value their independence from the political process and want to solve pressing problems.Sage is not a monolithic body. Nor is it the arbiter of truth. None of those who attend its meetings would see it that way. The group and its members aren’t there to make judgments about how the government uses its advice. There are plenty of other mechanisms for holding the government to account. Inidual contributors are free to hold their own opinions and to talk openly about them, but Sage works by consensus, recording where necessary when there are disagreements.A small army of scientists has been helping us navigate this crisis. Many have nothing to do with Sage, but the vast majority will be acutely aware of the responsibility and trust invested in them. In the years to come, when this awful disease is no longer shaping all of our lives, they will probably once again merge into the background, but I hope they will not be forgotten.• Ian Boyd is a professor of biology at the University of St Andrews and a contributor to Sage"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08453be9114b9edc5684a529e92824530a1b147b/0_191_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52804ea0e2fc2df8bcbc0be8d0ea17f9","title":"venice tourism covid 19 coronavirus green tourism","story":"Coronavirus has given hotspots like the besieged Italian port breathing space – and a vision of a new, greener kind of tourismBefore Covid-19, the tourist industry was the largest employer by sector on the planet, giving work to one in every 11 people. And when the emergency ends, it will surely resurge – but should it return in the way it was before? Maybe now, finally, is a good time to rethink what tourism should be.Before the coronavirus outbreak, the number of global tourists was predicted to balloon to 1.8 billion international arrivals a year by 2030. In 1950 that number was at 25 million. That huge increase cuts two ways. Tourism supports jobs, often bringing vital economic sustenance to historic or remote places. But over-tourism has a clear downside for the frailest destinations, like Machu Picchu in Peru, for many historic city centres, like New Orleans or Dubrovnik, and for the location I know best, Venice. There, 30 million annual visitors exert enormous demands on the residents, the heritage and the environment, changing tourism into a corrosive force.In the years just before the coronavirus outbreak I spent months in the city of canals and culture interviewing Venetians about their lives. Invariably, the first thing they wanted to tell me about was the effects of mass tourism how, since the 1990s, it has pushed out residents how streets and squares can become dangerously overcrowded how it has pushed up housing costs and destroyed local shops that now all cater to sandwich-eating, souvenir-buying tourists and little else how it allows overweening sightseers to invade weddings, baptisms and funerals at its religious places. The social ties Venice once enjoyed, its rhythm of life, even the vibrant artisanal trades, are now almost a thing of the past.On top of all that, the millions of tourists coming to Venice put pressure on the environment by generating mountains of refuse, through the heavy use of the vaporetti water ferries and taxis, by over-stressing ancient buildings, and with the moisture in their collective breath on artworks. The hundreds of visits from floating resorts – massive cruise ships each with up to 4,000 passengers – add to air pollution and cause erosion of the area’s sensitive lagoon environment.The population of Venice, more than 170,000 after the second world war, has dropped steadily to some 52,000 today. Remaining residents still feel fortunate to live in a city of such beauty, many believing their culture survives despite the onslaught, but they also grieve at the losses, lose heart, and move away at a rate of 1,000 a year to homes on the mainland. A Venice without Venetians – without significant numbers of permanent residents – is predicted for as early as 2030.It is no exaggeration to say that mass tourism – adding to Venice’s existing issues with mismanagement of the environment, corruption, political stasis and now the climate emergency – is bringing the community, the lagoon and a fabulous heritage to within a hair’s breadth of collapse.Tourism was a fairly benign source of livelihood for Venice until the world itself took a step-change some 30 years ago, when a new economics helped bring on cheap air travel, faster communications and an accelerated globalisation. When management of the city was handed over to the market with few controls, Venice was turned into an asset for stripping. Regional changes to Italian laws in the 1990s unleashed rampant property trading that deepened the effects of mass tourism.Yet Venetians believe that they can still save Venice, and many are fighting for it and demanding that politicians do more. They want them to manage tourist numbers and pass new laws to govern property sales and rentals and put an end to the Airbnb-led free-for-all that is pushing residents out. They call for a focus on long-term accommodation at sustainable costs and more jobs through economic ersification. They want more environmental measures, especially a ban on outsized cruise ships, and improved treatment of the lagoon that is vital to Venice’s life.This has come into sharp focus in the months-long Covid-19 breathing space, when the sudden emptying of the city restored a lost tranquility, along with fish, swans and cormorants to canals no longer churned by excessive traffic. Most of all, it ignited the hope that this difficult moment for the world could eventually offer a turning point. The need in Venice, and in so many other destinations, is for a new tourism, one that also benefits residents – not one organised around speculators, landlords, and traveller’s demands. We visitors must see tourism less as an unquestionable entitlement and more as a part of our responsibility to sustain life on Earth. This must ultimately include limiting tourist numbers. Tourism after coronavirus requires a new mindset. Maybe we can’t visit places so casually maybe we will need to sacrifice the freedom to drop in at any time and go anywhere as fast as we can or by whatever means suits us. We need to accept life – and visiting – at a slower pace.Beyond that we need to end our passivity as tourists and see destinations as people’s homes, not just attractions. We should acquaint ourselves with local conditions and be ready to refrain from travelling if authorities listen only to monied interests and fail to foster local livelihoods and protect the local environment. Greener attitudes will help fragile destinations to live on – and allow masterpieces such as Venice to survive for generations to come.• Neal E Robbins is the author of Venice, an Odyssey: Hope and Anger in the Iconic City, out in July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/234229e8249e9429790af78b7cdcd9c10e3561f3/0_0_1698_1020/master/1698.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2d29d7b7fe63a269939f9932da982e4","title":"jon pointing funniest things","story":"The actor, writer and character comedian on the things that make him laugh the mostThe first one that came to mind was Sally Phillips hiding a slice of toast between her toes in Smack the Pony.I, Partridge: We Need to Talk About Alan is probably the only book I’ve read that really made me laugh without also being a bit depressing.When we were kids we made a trilogy of gangster films.

All of her year 12s have turned up online to learn about the acid-catalysed elimination of an alcohol. “They’re pretty good at getting out of bed, but they’re 17-year-old boys,” she says. “If one is missing, I get one of their friends to text them and they soon turn up.”Like all teachers at the UK’s biggest independent boys’ school, Roberts has been offering a full timetable since the school closed on 20 March – up to 49 lessons a fortnight.All 1,600 pupils, aged seven to 18, have been expected online for their usual six daily classes, with everything from PE to organic chemistry taught over the internet instead of in the warren of buildings that sprawl across a large chunk of Rusholme, one of the most deprived and erse wards in central Manchester.Five days before Boris Johnson announced the closure of English schools, Martin Boulton, the high master, decided he needed to make sure all his students were online, fast. Around 120 pupils did not have access to their own computer. Many, but not all, were among the 200 boys on full bursaries at the school, which otherwise charges fees of £12,930 a year.Staff rounded up all spare laptops, dismantled a bunch of desktop computers and dropped them off at pupils’ homes. Boulton’s ambitious plan to transfer the entire curriculum online could only work if every boy could log on to Microsoft Teams.The fact that most state schools could not follow suit is the main reason, Boulton believes, that an estimated 2 million children in the UK – one in five of the total – have done little or no work since lockdown.“The one thing the government needed to get right – and still needs to get right –\u0026nbspis ensuring that every child has access to a computer and the internet. The government announced its centralised scheme offering laptops to disadvantaged children on 19 April. I had a couple of state school heads come in to share ideas yesterday and I know one of those hasn’t received a single laptop,” he said as he gave the  a tour of his almost empty school.He believes the government should have announced a national drive to get computers to all children, like it did with ventilators for hospitals. “Think of how many offices will have laptops lying around surplus to requirements.”Ten miles away in Salford, in a modern complex next to the M60 ringroad, Ben Davis, the head at St Ambrose Barlow Roman Catholic high school, has yet to receive any of the laptops he applied for via the government scheme. Only 10 children qualified, despite more than half of his 1,000 pupils not having their own computer. Many have been sharing with siblings or home-working parents, and a small number – fewer than 20, he thinks – have no suitable device at all.The school quickly gave out all its spares but there were not nearly enough to go round. This is partly why the school has not been offering regular lessons live online in most subjects (“it’s a basic equality issue”), and why at Easter it decided to go analogue, buying hundreds of textbooks to deliver to families where internet and computer access was “compromised”.Live teaching is not the holy grail, insists Davis, who has been head for almost five years. “I do think it’s perfectly possible for kids to have a really valuable experience of learning without live teaching.”He decided early on that the wellbeing of his students had to come first. “Lost learning is serious but it’s not as serious in the long-run as damaged wellbeing, which is fundamentally a real problem for children and families. We were very concerned about the effects of isolation and the likelihood of domestic violence increasing, of families coming under strain.” Though teachers are not marking work, as advised by the National Education Union, the main teachers’ union, they phone every pupil at least once a week and give feedback whenever they can.On Monday this week, Davis’s newly sterile school – water fountains taped off, yellow footprints in the corridors to mark out 2-metre spacings – reopened for year 10s to come in with a parent or carer for a pastoral chat with their form teacher. Half an hour each was allocated, “but some have taken an hour and a half. People have a lot to say. It all comes pouring out.”The year 10s won’t be taught anything in school until 29 June, when they will return for one day a week in bubbles of eight pupils for private study and support with wellbeing and home learning, which will remain the predominant form of education for all St Ambrose pupils.At MGS, which normally has 233 pupils in its Swiss chalet-like wooden junior school, year 6 pupils have been back for three weeks. Children who are at home shielding themselves or a family member are able to log in from home to a classroom rigged up with a camera so they can see their teacher and friends, chipping in when they know the answer and asking for help in real time.The sophisticated set-up has not cost much, Boulton says. “We’ve not thrown a lot of money at this issue to make it work. We’ve asked an immense amount of our teachers.” Regardless of their own caring commitments, teachers have had to work full time, though those with children at home have been allowed to encourage more independent learning, which they mark when their own offspring are in bed.The results, he says, have exceeded expectations. “Because we have stuck to our normal timetable, lessons have gone on as normal, but we haven’t been doing cricket fixtures, athletic meets, all of those things that would take children out of school. The focus of pace and teaching is different using the technology. Everybody has come to me and said we’ve got through the syllabus and are doing a lot of extension work.Davis and his team decided that three hours a day was a realistic target for their pupils to learn during lockdown, down from the five they would have normally. “Fairly quickly we realised – and I realise this as a parent as well – that a lot of kids can do the work quicker – though not necessarily better – at home than they can in school, for the simple reason that they are not having a teacher stand and take a register and explain things. If you say to all the kids: ‘You must be working from 8.40 until just after 3pm,’ that’s going to create huge pressure in families. How is that practical if everyone else is working from home?”Could St Ambrose offer a full timetable like MGS? “If we took the step of saying everything is going online, we would risk cutting out quite a large proportion of our catchment area – and we are not a school with a disproportionate level of disadvantage,” says Davis.“If I knew all children had access to a computer and broadband, you would still need to manage the workload and the expectations on the teacher and also how you do period after period with 30 kids. In theory I can see it would have some merits. My concern is that I can’t see everyone having that provision. It’s a lovely aspiration.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b17e0029fd49d882db07997b37bd61ddf65cfea8/8_104_1272_763/master/1272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=855e4070722b3fe4b502d0ad9beef611","title":"tiny plankton tell the oceans story this vast marine mission has been listening","story":"Since 1931 ‘citizen scientists’ on ships have enabled data collection on the tiny building blocks of the sea. Now this research could shape how we tackle the climate crisisOn a clear day, from their small, unassuming warehouse on the south Devon coast, Lance Gregory and Dave Wilson can see right across Plymouth Sound to the Eddystone lighthouse. Today, they’re watching a ferry from Brittany, the Armorique, pull into dock.Behind it, the ferry is towing a one-metre-long device shaped like a torpedo. It doesn’t look like much, but it’s part of the planet’s longest-running global marine survey.The device is called a continuous plankton recorder (CPR), and it’s one of 53 such devices that Gregory and Wilson manoeuvre using forklifts in their warehouse, surrounded by racks of distinctive yellow boxes and clipboards covered in spreadsheets.They dispatch these CPRs in bright yellow boxes to “ships of opportunity” – ferries, cargo or container vessels that have agreed to volunteer for the mission. Once a ship leaves port, the crew attach the device to the stern using steel wire, then toss it overboard.Trailing along behind the ship, it collects data for the CPR survey. The mission is vast but the subject is minuscule: plankton, the tiny organisms that drift in the ocean. Every marine ecosystem relies on plankton for its basic food source, and it generates half the oxygen we breathe. Perhaps more than any other organism, it is crucial to all life on our planet.The CPR survey is the longest-running marine science project of its kind. It began in 1931 when the scientist Sir Alister Hardy investigated how herring were influenced by plankton in the North Sea. This month the distance surveyed will reach an impressive 7m nautical miles, equivalent to 320 circumnavigations of the Earth.Since that first tow from Hull to Germany 89 years ago, the equipment has hardly changed. So far a quarter of a million samples have been analysed, representing a vast geographical spread over the course of the past century. The immense scope has allowed scientists to see dramatic patterns in ocean health, across both time and space, building a much clearer picture of how our marine environments are changing.It is also, says Gregory, “one of the oldest citizen science projects in the world”. Although it is coordinated by the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth, which houses the world’s largest biological library of microscopic plankton, the survey relies on the goodwill of the merchant ships who agree to take the recorders with them as they cross the world’s oceans.“We have a navy of volunteers,” Wilson says, “from the crane operators to the ship’s agents and terminal managers in ports, right through to the boatswains and captains on the ships that tow our equipment.”He’s known as the “Milk Tray man” in British ports, because he often takes chocolates as gifts for the sailors to thank them for their help.“Because most crews and port staff remember us, a glitch at sea or tricky courier logistics are much easier to resolve,” he says. “We also realise that while it’s mission critical for us, for these guys in ports, it’s an add-on –\u0026nbspand they’re under more pressure than ever right now.”Covid-19 has posed the biggest threat to this research in 90 years – even more so than the second world war, organisers say – because the logistics of getting the CPRs to and from ports is very difficult with current travel restrictions.\u0026nbspBut while the pandemic has scuttled much biological research, the plankton survey has been able to continue on essential shipping routes, because no special scientific knowledge is required of the crew volunteers. CPRs are designed to be robust, failsafe and very easy to use. And because this low-tech piece of kit is mechanically driven by a small propeller that spins while being towed, it’s low maintenance.Seawater flows in through a small aperture at the front for every 10 nautical miles towed, it filters three cubic metres of water. Inside, plankton are collected between two layers of silk on a “cassette” that moves constantly onto a collection spool, which sits in formaldehyde to preserve the sample.\u0026nbspTried and tested for decades, the little torpedoes can be towed for up to 500 nautical miles at a time, with each 10cm of silk representing one 10-nautical mile sample.“We’ve recorded more than 200m biological records of inidual species from the samples we’ve analysed,” says David Johns, head of the CPR survey. “This resource is freely available online to everyone, from schoolchildren all the way up to top-flight scientists, who use our data for a myriad of different reasons.”Plankton are defined as organisms that drift in the ocean, unable to swim against the current. Because they are so dependent on ocean patterns, studying them can teach us about the health of not just the seas, but of the planet itself. The longer the research continues, the greater its value for predicting future trends – and confronted with a climate crisis, that predictive power has never been more valuable.\u0026nbspDr Clare Ostle, one of the CPR research scientists, has analysed more than 800 different types of plankton, from plant-like phytoplankton – which photosynthesise to produce oxygen – to the animals known collectively as zooplankton, which include fish larvae and jellyfish.“With the spring plankton bloom kicking off right now, it’s a critical time for collecting samples,” she says. “A lot of people will be relying on this data, as their own monitoring programmes aren’t able to continue during the pandemic. So it’s a big deal for us.”\u0026nbspThe scope of the survey has evolved over time. Since 2017, tows have included shipping routes along the north-west passage, as a result of ice melt in the Arctic. Meanwhile, as research questions change and new technologies come into play, fresh data can be collected from old samples. “We’ve had people come to us wanting to look back in time, to study plastic pollution, for example,” Ostle says. The first complete plastic bag caught by the records was recorded in 1965, and studies since then show an increasing amount of plastic fishing debris getting caught up in the recording equipment.Indeed, in collaboration with the University of Plymouth’s Prof Richard Thompson, Ostle’s studies of plankton dating back to the 50s were able to confirm the significant increase in plastics in the open ocean since the 80s. As a result of this pioneering study in 2004, Thompson coined the phrase “microplastics”, for fragments smaller than 5mm (and which are now so ubiquitous that some plankton have been found to ingest them).The study also provides insight into the spread of disease. After a form of cholera was contracted by people eating contaminated fish eggs on the west coast of Canada, scientists used the plankton survey to map the spread of cholera bacteria, which they found clinging to the surface of some plankton such as fish eggs.The most crucial thing plankton can help us understand, however, is likely to be how the climate crisis is affecting our oceans. The shifting distribution of plankton is a measurable effect of rising sea temperatures. By studying samples over 30 years, Ostle has found that plankton living in colder waters have significantly smaller areas where they can thrive. Meanwhile, plankton living in warmer waters are moving towards cooler conditions in the poles.“This has major impacts on fish stocks, seabird populations and so many other marine animals that feed on plankton,” says Ostle. “Plankton also absorb CO2 emissions, so they are a massive natural carbon sink that we need to protect.“It’s so important that we maintain this unusual dataset, because there are still so many discoveries to be made, and stories that haven’t yet been told.”Wilson and Gregory, for their part, are working hard to make sure the “golden thread of volunteers in ports around the world” know they’re more appreciated than ever. During the pandemic he has been packing goody bags, including sweets and ing or football magazines, to send off to the crews as a special thanks.“Everyone involved knows the value of the health of our oceans, because this is their livelihood,” he says of the citizen-scientist sailors who’ve been crucial to the mission since 1931. “They have the sea in their heart. And they really appreciate the chocolates.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b66387f580eb0154d8074e0f2c43d364c7cc26c5/3_0_9490_5696/master/9490.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67c2f7be4eede3b92fcebe42d091d48a","title":"why you should go animal free arguments in favour of meat eating debunked plant based","story":"Unpalatable as it may be for those wedded to producing and eating meat, the environmental and health evidence for a plant-based diet is clearWhether you are concerned about your health, the environment or animal welfare, scientific evidence is piling up that meat-free diets are best. Millions of people in wealthy nations are already cutting back on animal products.Of course livestock farmers and meat lovers are unsurprisingly fighting back and it can get confusing. Are avocados really worse than beef? What about bee-massacring almond production?The coronavirus pandemic has added another ingredient to that mix. The rampant destruction of the natural world is seen as the root cause of diseases leaping into humans and is largely driven by farming expansion. The world’s top bioersity scientists say even more deadly pandemics will follow unless the ecological devastation is rapidly halted.Food is also a vital part of our culture, while the affordability of food is an issue of social justice. So there isn’t a single perfect diet. But the evidence is clear: whichever healthy and sustainable diet you choose, it is going to have much less red meat and dairy than today’s standard western diets, and quite possibly none. That’s for two basic reasons.So what about all those arguments in favour of meat-eating and against vegan diets? Let’s start with the big beef about red meat.This is true only when compared to intensively-reared beef linked to forest destruction. The UK’s National Farmers Union says UK beef has only half the emissions compared to the world average. But a lot of research shows grass-fed beef uses more land and produces more – or at best similar – emissions because grain is easier for cows to digest and intensively reared cows live shorter lives. Both factors mean less methane. Either way, the emissions from even the best beef are still many times that from beans and pulses.Methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas and ruminants produce a lot of it. But it only remains in the atmosphere for a relatively short time: half is broken down in nine years. This leads some to argue that maintaining the global cattle herd at current levels – about 1 billion animals – is not heating the planet. The burping cows are just replacing the methane that breaks down as time goes by.But this is simply “creative accounting”, according to Pete Smith at the University of Aberdeen and Andrew Balmford at the University of Cambridge. We shouldn’t argue that cattle farmers can continue to pollute just because they have done so in the past, they say: “We need to do more than just stand still.” In fact, the short-lived nature of methane actually makes reducing livestock numbers a “particularly attractive target”, given that we desperately need to cut greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis.In any case, just focusing on methane doesn’t make the rampant deforestation by cattle ranchers in South America go away. Even if you ignore methane completely, says Poore, animal products still produce more CO2 than plants. Even one proponent of the methane claim says: “I agree that intensive livestock farming is unsustainable.”NFU president, Minette Batters, says: “Sixty-five percent of British land is only suitable for grazing livestock and we have the right climate to produce high-quality red meat and dairy.”“But if everybody were to make the argument that ‘our pastures are the best and should be used for grazing’, then there would be no way to limit global warming,” says Marco Springmann at the University of Oxford. His work shows that a transition to a predominantly plant-based flexitarian diet would free up both pasture and cropland.The pasture could instead be used to grow trees and lock up carbon, provide land for rewilding and the restoration of nature, and growing bio-energy crops to displace fossil fuels. The crops no longer being fed to animals could instead become food for people, increasing a nation’s self-sufficiency in grains.Furthermore, research shows this carbon storage reaches its limit in a few decades, while the problem of methane emissions continue. The stored carbon is also vulnerable - a change in land use or even a drought can see it released again. Proponents of “holistic grazing” to trap carbon are also criticised for unrealistic extrapolation of local results to global levels.That is probably true but misses the real point. A huge driver of the global wildlife crisis is the past and continuing destruction of natural habitat to create pasture for livestock. Herbivores do have an important role in ecosystems, but the high density of farmed herds means pasture is worse for wildlife than natural land. Eating less meat means less destruction of wild places and cutting meat significantly would also free up pasture and cropland that could be returned to nature. Furthermore, a third of all cropland is used to grow animal feed.But animals can play a role in some parts of Africa and Asia where, in India for example, waste from grain production can feed cattle that produce milk. In the rest of the world, where much of cropland that could be used to feed people is actually used to feed animals, a cut in meat eating is still needed for agriculture to be sustainable.Soya milk also has much smaller emissions and land and water use than cow’s milk. If you are worried about the Amazon, not eating meat remains your best bet.Some almond production may well cause environmental problems. But that is because rising demand has driven rapid intensification in specific places, like California, which could be addressed with proper regulation. It is nothing to do with what almonds need to grow. Traditional almond production in Southern Europe uses no irrigation at all. It is also perhaps worth noting that the bees that die in California are not wild, but raised by farmers like six-legged livestock.Like soya milk, almond milk still has lower carbon emissions and land and water use than cow’s milk. But if you are still worried, there are plenty of alternatives, with oat milk usually coming out with the lowest environmental footprint.Again, the problem here is the rapid growth of production in specific regions that lack prudent controls on water use, like Peru and Chile. Avocados generate three times less emissions than chicken, four times less than pork, and 20 times less than beef.If you are still worried about avocados, you can of course choose not to eat them. But it’s not a reason to eat meat instead, which has a much bigger water and deforestation footprint.The market is likely to solve the problem, as the high demand from consumers for avocados and almonds incentivises farmers elsewhere to grow the crops, thereby alleviating the pressure on current production hotspots.Quinoa is an amazing food and has seen a boom. But the idea that this took food from the mouths of poor farmers is wrong. “The claim that rising quinoa prices were hurting those who had traditionally produced and consumed it is patently false,” said researchers who studied the issue.Quinoa was never a staple food, representing just a few percent of the food budget for these people. The quinoa boom has had no effect on their nutrition. The boom also significantly boosted the farmers’ income.There is an issue with falling soil quality, as the land is worked harder. But quinoa is now planted in China, India and Nepal, as well as in the US and Canada, easing the burden. The researchers are more worried now about the loss of income for South American farmers as the quinoa supply rises and the price falls.Palm oil plantations have indeed led to terrible deforestation. But that is an issue for everybody, not only vegans: it’s in about half of all products on supermarket shelves, both food and toiletries. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature argues that choosing sustainably produced palm oil is actually positive, because other oil crops take up more land.But Poore says: “We are abandoning millions of acres a year of oilseed land around the world, including rapeseed and sunflower fields in the former Soviet regions, and traditional olive plantations.” Making better use of this land would be preferable to using palm oil, he says.A vegan diet is generally very healthy, but doctors have warned about the potential lack of B12, an important vitamin for brain function that is found in meat, eggs and cows’ milk. This is easily remedied by taking a supplement.The rapid rise of the plant-based burger has prompted some to criticise them as ultra-processed junk food. A plant-based burger could be unhealthier if the salt levels are very high, says Springmann, but it is most likely to still be healthier than a meat burger when all nutritional factors are considered, particularly fibre. Furthermore, replacing a beef burger with a plant-based alternative is certain to be less damaging to the environment.There is certainly a strong argument to be made that overall we eat far too much processed food, but that applies just as much to meat eaters as to vegetarians and vegans. And given that most people are unlikely to give up their burgers and sausages any time, the plant-based options are a useful alternative.Most vegans would say it’s just silly to say fruit and veg are animal products and plenty are produced without animal dung. In any case there is no reason for horticulture to rely on manure at all. Synthetic fertiliser is easily made from the nitrogen in the air and there is plenty of organic fertiliser available if we chose to use it more widely in the form of human faeces. Over application of fertiliser does cause water pollution problems in many parts of the world. But that applies to both synthetic fertiliser and manure and results from bad management.Piers Morgan is among those railing against “hypocrite” vegans because commercially kept bees die while pollinating almonds and avocados and combine harvesters “create mass murder of bugs” and small mammals while bringing in the grain harvest. But almost everyone eats these foods, not just vegans.It is true that insects are in a terrible decline across the planet. But the biggest drivers of this are the destruction of wild habitat, largely for meat production, and widespread pesticide use. If it is insects that you are really worried about, then eating a plant-based organic diet is the option to choose.A “planetary health diet” published by scientists to meet both global health and environmental needs was criticised by journalist Joanna Blythman: “When ideologues living in affluent countries pressurise poor countries to eschew animal foods and go plant-based, they are displaying crass insensitivity, and a colonial White Saviour mindset.”In fact, says Springmann, who was part of the team behind the planetary health diet, it would improve nutritional intake in all regions, including poorer regions where starchy foods currently dominate diets. The big cuts in meat and dairy are needed in rich nations. In other parts of the world, many healthy, traditional diets are already low in animal products.Livestock farming is massively subsidised with taxpayers money around the world – unlike vegetables and fruit. That money could be used to support more sustainable foods such as beans and nuts instead, and to pay for other valuable services, such as capturing carbon in woodlands and wetlands, restoring wildlife, cleaning water and reducing flood risks. Shouldn’t your taxes be used to provide public goods rather than harms?So, food is complicated. But however much we might wish to continue farming and eating as we do today, the evidence is crystal clear that consuming less meat and more plants is very good for both our health and the planet. The fact that some plant crops have problems is not a reason to eat meat instead.In the end, you will choose what you eat. If you want to eat healthily and sustainably, you don’t have to stop eating meat and dairy altogether. The planetary health diet allows for a beef burger, some fish and an egg each week, and a glass of milk or some cheese each day.Food writer Michael Pollan foreshadowed the planetary health diet in 2008 with a simple seven-word rule: “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” But if you want to have the maximum impact on fighting the climate and wildlife crisis, then it is going to be all plants."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10da2fd9bdb0c46c0f6101f9f1cd9c22bdbc2c8b/302_716_2615_1569/master/2615.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52d02256fd59dbb00325362700ae8b47","title":"ive never seen con air","story":"Bare-chested fist-fights, loud guitar riffs, a billowing American flag and Malkovich turned up to 11. This is a cheese-filled treatI was prepared to like Con Air and, happily, I was not disappointed. The overall impression of watching the 1997 action classic is a lot like riding the Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith at Disney World: a sandblasting assault on your senses to a thrashing rock-music soundtrack. Con Air is bombastic and overblown, but always entertaining. I enjoyed it tremendously.What I most enjoyed about Con Air is how straightforward it is. Director Simon West sensibly realises that, in the best action films, the plot is simply the connective tissue between the fight scenes, and he doesn’t overcook things. The film’s entire premise is set up before the opening credits roll, and exposition is kept light throughout.And what fight scenes they are. A jet takes off with a convertible tied to its rear! It crash-lands into the Las Vegas strip! Cage and Malkovich duke it out on top of a moving fire truck! Just when you think the film can’t throw anything else at you, someone says “Call in the attack helicopters!” and a fleet of aircraft hover into shot.The one-liners zing faster than the bullets punching the hold of the plane. “Looks like you missed your connection,” announces Malkovich, before immolating a traitorous fellow con. “Make a move and the bunny gets it,” Malkovich says, holding Casey’s stuffed toy at gunpoint. (Malkovich has all the best lines.) Modern action films are often overly serious – I’m looking at you, Tom Cruise – but Con Air is enjoyable precisely because it is ridiculous. I can’t think of another action film as campily self-aware or entertainingly silly.The film isn’t perfect: there are racial and transphobic slurs, and the female characters are basically just plot points. But the casting of Cage is an inspired touch: he brings levity to a character who might in other hands be a flat-footed demonstration of masculinity’s worst excesses. I can’t think of another action lead who’d play the role with the vulnerability on show when he breaks down in tears during Poe’s reconciliation with his wife. (I welled up.) Cage’s famously flamboyant acting style also works well in a movie that is, for want of a better word, hammy (how else can you describe a film that features John Malkovich holding a bunny rabbit at gunpoint?)At its heart, Con Air is a quixotic fantasy about the responsible expression of masculinity, in which rapists have the misogyny knocked out of them by bare-chested hunks with free-flowing hair, and law and order can be restored by the efforts of one heroic man acting alone. Poe always identifies on the side of the authorities despite the fact the system imprisoned him unjustly. (In his jail cell, an American flag hangs from the bunk bed.) When Poe is trapped on the plane with a gang of marauding criminals, he instinctively works to thwart their efforts, becoming in effect a proxy for law and order itself.I don’t agree with Con Air’s masculinist world view, but I certainly enjoyed the stunts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09a289a688bf1347c17cfa8f937c41f1f07f2251/0_61_8620_5173/master/8620.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6583b57f291fba196e9861561a50419","title":"ian holm a virtuoso actor of steel sinew and charm peter bradshaw appreciation","story":"Alien, Lord of the Rings, Chariots of Fire and so many more extraordinary performances in classic films – what an exemplary career the actor Ian Holm, who has died aged 88, leaves behind • News: Ian Holm dies aged 88• Gallery: Ian Holm – A life in picturesThere was always a cool, rational, weighted intelligence in Ian Holm. On screen, he was never exactly a heart-on-sleeve performer he did not need or even appear to want the audience’s sympathies. Holm could be a mandarin and almost priestly presence, but always with a pressure cooker of emotion inside. He brought a commanding strength and a stillness to his work, a less-is-more economy that gave him what few theatrical knights have had since Olivier: equal success on stage and screen. He was a character actor with star quality.It is funny that younger cinema audiences knew and loved Ian Holm for perhaps the most atypical casting of his career: as Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies.He plays the older Bilbo, who potters and maunders about the place with great geniality and charm, like a distracted Oxford don who happens also to run MI6. There was something beguiling in seeing Holm’s habitually stern features transformed into Hobbity gentleness.His other roles were rather different. He broke out in his mid-40s, having already established an accomplished career in film, TV and theatre. Ridley Scott cast Holm in his legendary 1979 sci-fi classic Alien, about the spacecraft that gets an unwelcome, parasitic visitor. Holm played Ash, the ship’s science officer: he is a calm technocratic figure who remains notably unemotional for reasons that will become plain in the film’s great shocking reveal. In unforgettably gruesome circumstances, the crew ask Ash what he thinks about their prospects and in a frazzled and gurgling voice he says: “I can’t lie to you about your chances. But you have my sympathies.” It was a great moment for Holm.But his biggest success came a couple of years later, in the colossally successful British movie Chariots of Fire, written by Colin Welland and directed by Hugh Hudson. He played the Geordie-born professional sports trainer Sam Mussabini who, controversially, coaches the ambitious Cambridge undergraduate sportsman Harold Abrahams, played by Ben Cross. It was a heartwarming performance by Holm, and it earned him an Academy award nomination as best supporting actor.Mussabini is fussy, tetchy, but fierce about his work – with a vocational teacher’s insistence on high standards and a tendency to take pupils’ failings personally. Mussabini wears his straw boater at all times indoors, even when he’s massaging Abrahams. And when Abrahams wins, he punches a hole in that hat for sheer joy. Holm allows us to see how emotionally vulnerable Sam has become, and that Abrahams is like a son to him.In the 1980s, Holm developed a steely, sinewy presence in the cinema: he brought a definite stringency or severity. Holm was the hard-drinking solicitor Stanley Pilborough in David Hare’s haunting drama Wetherby (1985) and the same year he was in Terry Gilliam’s surreal fantasia Brazil, in which he played Mr Kurtzmann, the boss of Sam (played by Jonathan Pryce), the film’s hapless hero. In that, Kurtzmann was a stressed bureaucrat in a tight suit and with an odd little moustache. He looked like Peter Sellers’ shop steward Fred Kite in the Boulting brothers’ I’m All Right Jack.It was his third film in 1985 that gave us one of Holm’s best performances: the superb crime drama Dance With a Stranger, written by Shelagh Delaney and directed by Mike Newell. It featured Miranda Richardson as Ruth Ellis, the brassy blond nightclub hostess and the last woman in Britain to be hanged for murder Rupert Everett played her sulky, haughty boyfriend, David Blakeley. Holm has the thankless but fascinating role as Desmond Cussen, Ruth’s poor lapdog gentleman caller – humiliated and emasculated – who remains slavishly in love with Ruth, despite her obsession with the younger and more glamorous Blakeley.It is Cussen who cares about the children Ruth has from a previous marriage, and he can see Ruth’s self-destructive vanities all too clearly. He hates himself and hates her for how he feels – and very much hates arrogant smoothie David.There is unforgettable ferocity in his rage when Everett’s David upsets Ruth’s young son, Andy, by inventing horrible things that are going to happen to him at boarding school. “He’s teasing you, Andy!” Desmond snaps, a whiplash of emotion. Interestingly, it is Holm’s Desmond who looks like the one capable of murder.Holm went on to have great roles in David Cronenberg’s eXistenZ and Naked Lunch, in Luc Besson’s The Fifth Element, in Kenneth Branagh’s Frankenstein and also Martha Fiennes’s Chromophobia, in which he had a startling, black-comic sex scene with Penélope Cruz.For me, his greatest and most complex role was in Atom Egoyan’s 1997 film The Sweet Hereafter, playing Mitchell Stephens, the lawyer who mysteriously shows up in a small Canadian town where locals are grieving the deaths of dozens of children in a school-bus crash. Stephens tries to persuade everyone to work up the righteous rage necessary to sue the bus manufacturers.He is cool and lawyerly, even passionless in rimless glasses: a rare instance, in any movie, of being a figure who is disturbing yet not obviously evil. His lawyer is partly an angel of vengeance, partly a bizarre destructive parasite who appears in the community stirring up unimaginable pain, reopening psychological wounds that had begun to heal, encouraging the bereaved parents to feel angry and then to channel that anger into a class-action lawsuit – and he will take a third of whatever payout results. However, it appears that his entire vocation is displacement activity, a need to right the wrongs in his personal life.This was Ian Holm’s finest hour. But I have the softest spot for his lovely performance in Chariots of Fire, as the kindly yet strict teacher who lives to see his pupil become a world beater – and becomes a world beater himself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0afdda0eeb7980edac26cab0b14c73f041c48ca4/130_0_3824_2296/master/3824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=502486e0ba66f0146acd04b3c9400c85","title":"football fans premier league return","story":"It was not the best night for Hawk-Eye or David Luiz.

Before I knew how to stand up, I would sit on my cousin’s old board and roll down the hills of Cáceres, my home town in Spain. My mum always worried I’d break a bone.When I was at university, I heard about Skate-Aid, an organisation that builds skateparks for children in disadvantaged communities. I’ve always wanted to make a positive impact on the world, and if there was a way to do that through skateboarding, then I was in. Every project is different. In Rwanda and Kenya, I worked with orphans and children from very poor backgrounds. In Namibia, I taught kids who were visually impaired. Part of the reason skating is good for kids psychologically is that it is challenging. If you want to learn a new trick you have to practise, and if you persevere, you’ll get there. The philosophy is simple: get up and try again. It’s an amazing form of self-development.I got a call in early 2019 to say the next project would be in Syria. I was apprehensive. While I was living in Africa, I got used to walking past soldiers with guns slung over their shoulders, but Syria was a different story. When I told my family I was considering going, they thought I was crazy, but I wanted to see the country with my own eyes.We flew to Lebanon and drove the rest of the way, taking a half-destroyed road from Beirut to Damascus. We stopped at military checkpoints every few minutes. I was anxious – I didn’t understand Arabic, and all the men I could see were armed. But our driver would hand over water or cigarettes, and we’d be allowed through.Our destination was Qudsaya, a city 7km west of Damascus that was held by rebels until 2016. As we drove through the centre, the scars from the fighting were everywhere: roads were puckered with cracks buildings covered in bullet holes, in which birds had built nests.I was immediately touched by people’s generosity. The area where we were building the skatepark had been largely destroyed, except for a small concrete structure where a family of four were living. They’d had to flee their home in the north. The mother was so welcoming, bringing us tea and coffee every morning before she even knew why we were there.It took our group 28 days to build the park. We’d get up early and spend all day working. Most people didn’t understand what we were doing at first – this was going to be Syria’s first skatepark – but once we showed them videos of our other projects, they wanted to help.We stayed in a house close to the site, and on the walk home from work we would buy falafels and fruit from nearby shops. Someone would always start speaking to us in French, Italian or German, because many locals had family abroad. The first time we went in, they wouldn’t let us pay. No tourists had been to the city in years and they were grateful we were there.We only had power once a day, so there wasn’t much electricity or hot water, but everyone in the area was in the same situation. We didn’t need luxury our days were so exhausting we’d just come home and sleep.There were moments I’ll never forget. One night I was woken by a huge blast and told there had been a missile strike on a military store 50km away. You fear for your life in those situations, but then you look at the children and realise this is what they face every day.The kids would watch us skating down the street and were so excited. When we finished the bowl, I put them on a board one by one and they were amazed by the feeling of rolling along. One boy was a natural he had never skated before, but within a week he was already dropping in from the edge. It can take kids months to do that.We stayed for two months, then local volunteers took over. I keep in touch with the kids on Facebook and they send me videos of the tricks they’ve learned. When we left, there were 400 children involved, going to the park every day. I’ve been to so many countries, but Syria was special. I built friendships with people even if we could only communicate with gestures. I’ll go back as soon as I can. • As told to Pip Cook.Do you have an experience to share?

A glinting maze of coins hosting different faces: Amy’s beehive, Attenborough, Shaznay from All Saints.Make statues that stand at our height and meet our gaze.

Provided you have a few ageing bananas hanging around, it’s easy to throw together with other ingredients you’re likely to have. What’s more, it’s perfectly acceptable to eat at any time of day and, thanks to those ageing bananas, it stays moist and toothsome for days longer than most other cakes.In spite of its timelessness, however, banana bread has had a serious moment during lockdown. Not only is everyone baking, but, if my fruit bowl is anything to go by, everyone has found themselves in possession of many more bananas than they can get through with their morning cereal. Little wonder banana bread makes so much sense.But, like Ariel the mermaid gazing up towards the ocean’s surface and dreaming of land, I want more. There’s only so much BB the self-isolated cake gannet can eat before wondering how else to use up bananas on the turn. Here’s some inspiration for you.’s Waste Not columnist, Tom Hunt, writes – horrifyingly – of how we throw away 1.4m bananas per day in the UK – “If we could acquire a taste for brown bananas, things would be different,” he says. One idea is his banana katsu curry, the over-ripe fruit bringing sweetness to the sauce alongside sharp green apple, spices, soy sauce and ketchup. An over-ripe banana is a parent’s best friend, its concentrated natural sugars sweetening everything from breakfast to pudding. It’s time to learn from the babies, folks. This recipe from Jamie Oliver is a good template – feel free to add other fruit, seeds, grains, nut butters and milks as you see fit, safe in the knowledge that ripe bananas and rolled oats have deliciousness covered for a very good start to the day. Kick off the weekend with these pancakes which, thanks to the walnut flour and oats, happen to be gluten-free. Although, says their inventor, Sarah Britton, of food blog My New Roots, the banana and walnut combo makes the texture of these a bit more like that of an under-baked cookie than the pillowy lightness of a more traditional breakfast pancake. While we’re at the breakfast table, why not try a banana jam? This very simple recipe is just 15 minutes in the making – much quicker than your average fruit jam – and flavoured with vanilla, lime and dark rum. With flavours like that, you could almost be on a Caribbean island. And we could all do with a bit of that right now. Over-ripe bananas are a gift to plant-based bakers, the fruit’s sticky, creamy texture when mashed is perfect when standing in for eggs (to bind) and butter (to enrich) – and let’s not forget that aforementioned sweetness. With that in mind, these flapjacks are vegan: decadently gooey, chocolate-flecked, flaxseed-studded, oat-filled bars of healthy-ish goodness. A joy all too easily forgotten. Now that grill season is upon us, why not stuff your ripe bananas with chocolate and cook them – still in their skins, wrapped in foil – on the barbecue? A British answer, perhaps, to the all-American s’more. Or, take them to the next level with Tamal Ray’s baked banana meringue recipe. This ultra-easy recipe from Claire Ptak – enhanced with honey, sea salt and good olive oil – brings good news for ice-cream lovers without an ice-cream machine. Hallelujah.Nigel Slater recommends this ginger and chilli-laced, sweet and sour condiment (the sour from rice vinegar, the sweet from the eponymous ’nanas) alongside sea bass fillets. But, like any ketchup, it would work in numerous contexts calling for a piquant sauce. Anybody moved by the marriage of chocolate and banana will find the image of this Liam Charles number quite devastating. Caramelised ripe bananas, chocolate mousse, a crunchy orange biscuit ... A rollercoaster of emotions, overwhelmingly positive. Meera Sodha’s healthier take on deep-fried Mangalorean banana puris are a treat for any time of day.

They will also be able to request a reduced interest rate on any additional borrowing in excess of £500.The FCA’s new guidance does not apply to other consumer credit products such as motor finance, payday loans and buy now, pay later. The regulator said that the separate guidance it had previously issued covering these products would be updated soon.Joanna Elson, the chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, said the FCA was right to give people more time.“The financial shock to households that the outbreak has caused is like nothing we have seen before and we expect debt problems to increase significantly in the months ahead,” she said.The FCA had already extended mortgage payment holidays until the end of October and UK Finance said lenders would be contacting borrowers who were coming to the end of their three-month deferral to discuss their options.In the first three weeks of the scheme, 1.2m mortgages were deferred and those borrowers will be due to resume payments soon.Eric Leenders, UK Finance’s managing director of personal finance, said the industry had a clear plan to help consumers.“Lenders understand that many households will continue to see their finances squeezed as the pandemic continues and we are working hard to ensure everyone gets the support suited to their needs,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7527670448f183da39582a9c977177e477bb1257/317_280_4308_2587/master/4308.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c47f4ee441862d0ed0521f3a609ea53","title":"dame vera lynn a life in pictures","story":"Vera Lynn has died at the age of 103.

However, it was also the product of two decades of demographic and political change that hit the party’s traditional base, and could endanger more Labour seats in 2024.“Labour’s electoral coalition had been fracturing for a long time and was broken in 2019. We were rejected by many of the communities we were founded to represent,” says the report, seen by the . “We lost all types of voters everywhere compared with 2017, except in London.”Using interviews with senior party figures, as well as previously unpublished polling and new analysis, the report identifies significant shortcomings in the election campaign, which followed 18 months of debilitating parliamentary wrangles over Brexit.• Labour “went into the 2019 election without a clear strategy of which voters we needed to persuade or how”, and failed to settle on a coherent message with the power of 2017’s “For the many, not the few”.• “It was unclear who was in charge” of the election campaign, and relationships were soured by years of infighting which had created a “toxic culture” and “significant strategic and operational dysfunction”.• Labour was outgunned by the Tories in the digital war, with messages poorly coordinated and most of them failing to reach beyond the party’s base.• Helped by their clear “Get Brexit done” message, the Conservatives succeeded in turning out 2 million previous non-voters, accounting for two thirds of the increase in their vote share.• Labour’s seat targeting was “unrealistic” and “not evidence-based”, and many candidates felt they did not receive enough support from the national party.Labour Together was set up to unite MPs and activists from different traditions, a number of whom – including the former leader Ed Miliband, Steve Reed, Lisa Nandy and Jim McMahon – have been given prominent roles in the shadow cabinet of Corbyn’s successor, Keir Starmer.The 2019 Election Review was prepared by a 15-strong panel of commissioners, including Miliband, the Manchester Central MP, Lucy Powell, James Meadway, who advised the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, and the Birmingham Ladywood MP, Shabana Mahmood.They find that Corbyn’s leadership was a “significant factor” in the 2019 result. His public approval ratings collapsed at around the time a group of Labour MPs including Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna left to found the Independent Group, citing antisemitism within Labour and its Brexit policy.The report says: “‘Stop Jeremy Corbyn’ was a major driver of the Conservatives’ success across all their key groups including previous non-voters, and among all the swing voters Labour lost to the Tories.”Had Corbyn been as popular in December as he was two years earlier, Labour’s vote share could have been 6 percentage points higher, the analysis finds.When it came to Labour’s radical manifesto, launched at an upbeat rally in Birmingham, the analysis found that inidual policies were popular, but doubts about the leadership stoked a perception that the package as a whole was not deliverable.A Datapraxis analysis of YouGov data found that “many came to the conclusion that the manifesto as a whole was unrealistic, risky and unlikely to be delivered. This undermined the positive response to inidual policies, making them seem less credible.”It shows that 2017’s better-than-expected performance masked the fact that Labour’s vote share had continued to decline in a string of heartland seats – many of which the party went on to lose to the Conservatives two years later.“Despite now representing fewer constituencies than at any time since 1935, Labour cannot afford to be complacent about the seats it currently holds,” the report says.And if Labour fails to “reverse its fortunes in Scotland in a significant way” it will have to win a swath of English seats, right up to Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg’s in North East Somerset, to secure a majority.Starmer, who became Labour leader in April, has so far announced few new policies, instead focusing on strongly criticising aspects of the government’s coronavirus pandemic response.The forward-looking section of the Labour Together review is based partly on a “coalition-building” workshop, bringing together “urban remainers” from London and Manchester, and leavers from towns in Lancashire and Yorkshire.Carried out by the consultancy firm Britain Thinks, the exercise identified common ground, including a “strong and unifying desire for economic transformation of their lives”.“This was particularly notable in relation to issues which affect their personal security and lives issues ranging from social housing and rent controls, to decent pay and living standards, as well as significant investment in their local infrastructure and amenities, like high streets, town centres and decent employers,” the report says.It recommends that Labour focus on trying to build a coalition around the idea of transformational economic change rooted in voters’ own lives and problems, and combine this with rebuilding “trust and credibility” in the party.“We believe there is a way ahead for Labour to win the next election, but the road is hard and the journey will not be easy,” it concludes. Starmer and Labour’s new general secretary, David Evans, are expected to pay close attention to the report.Allies of Corbyn insist Brexit – not his leadership – was the overriding factor behind the election result, and lay some of the blame at Starmer’s door for pushing the party towards a pro-referendum position. They are irked that the report’s authors did not interview several key figures, including party directors Karie Murphy and Seumas Milne, the former general secretary Jenny Formby, and Corbyn himself.Jon Trickett and Ian Lavery, the two most outspoken proponents of Brexit in Corbyn’s deeply ided top team, said: “Let’s be clear, people lost trust in Labour after failing to deliver change after 13 years in government. This was brought to a head when the party ignored the democratic vote for Brexit it was the excuse that allowed loyal Labour voters to finally break with a party they felt had been ignoring them for far too long.“Time and time again we warned the shadow cabinet that yielding to the pressures for the party to become more pro-remain and supportive of a second referendum would inflict damage on Labour’s election chances.”A Labour spokesperson said: “We thank everyone who contributed to this independent report. Its attempt to understand the challenges and opportunities facing the Labour party is welcome and we will read it carefully. By harnessing our collective skills and energy we will build a party and a movement that wins again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c502485f3789ada5da47da57c94f38359befaf77/104_447_5656_3393/master/5656.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9b846b4a073441b9937683ae78c668a","title":"key points from review of 2019 labour election defeat","story":"Corbyn leadership, Brexit policy and party structure among issues singled outA much-anticipated review of Labour’s 2019 election defeat, by a group of MPs, union leaders, officials and activists called Labour Together, has produced a 154-page report of findings and recommendations. These are the main points.It was, the authors concluded, “a terrible defeat for Labour”, one which “poses profound questions about the future prospects of our party”.As well as losing 59 seats, the second-highest loss by any opposition for a century, the report notes that the party shed votes in every part of the country, with the most significant swings being in north-east England, the West Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside and the east Midlands.The authors point to a long-term decline in voter loyalty to Labour, connected to weaker community links, such as through trade unions. It says Labour’s vote share declined between 2001 and 2010, then recovered slightly in 2015 and significantly in 2017 – but the fundamental issues remained.The 2017 result in particular, where Jeremy Corbyn defied expectations by denying Theresa May a majority, “contributed to a failure to reflect honestly on the reasons for the increase, or analyse the continuing underlying weaknesses in Labour’s voter coalition”.The report is unflinching in its analysis of how the leader’s appeal to voters plummeted between 2017 and 2019. Had his popularity stayed at its peak level, it says, Labour’s vote share in 2019 would have been 6 percentage points higher.The report says research suggests an “intense” dislike of Corbyn was a key factor among voters who switched from Labour to the Tories they raised issues such as antisemitism, perceived support for terrorism, and unaffordable policies.The views of one 52-year-old woman who voted Labour in 2017 are summarised in the report as: “Frightened at the possibility of a Marxist government. Disgusted at Corbyn being a terrorist sympathiser. Most disturbed about plan to nationalise BT as I fear it would allow a Labour government to spy on internet users.”This, the report finds, repelled both leave and remain voters. Of those who voted Labour in 2017, the party lost 1.9 million remain voters and 1.8 million leave voters in 2019. Given the generally pro-remain views of Labour voters, this represented a much higher proportion of leavers.For many of those who changed their choice between 2017 and 2019, voting for another party in the European elections in May provided “a conveyor belt” away from Labour, the authors say.Even those who stayed with Labour seemed to do so despite the party’s Brexit policy rather than because of it, with majorities of remain and leave backers saying they preferred to either stop Brexit entirely, or “get Brexit done”, respectively.The report finds a paradox: inidually, most of Labour’s policies were popular, but as a package they were seen as unrealistic, with voters not trusting the party to deliver them.In open-ended questions, Labour’s policies were cited as a positive reason to vote for the party, with policies like free broadband attracting majority support. But, the authors say: “The resistance came mostly as people evaluated the overall package of proposals.”Some cited affordability as a worry others expressed scepticism about whether the manifesto could be delivered. The worries were shared within Labour, the report found, with some activists saying the seemingly endless flow of new policies had “an advent calendar feel to it, with each new day opening a door promising more stuff”.Labour also faced problems with policies that had merely been discussed at its autumn conference, but not implemented. Members polled for the study said Labour’s apparent plans to abolish private education were raised negatively on the doorstep, even though this never became a policy.The cumulative effect of Corbyn’s unpopularity, the Brexit position and the manifesto was bigger than the sum of their parts, the report argues, making the party seem unelectable by too many voters.The authors write: “To go into an election with any one of these vulnerabilities – an unpopular leader, a problematic position on the key issue of the day, or serious questions about the deliverability of key policies – would be a challenge, one that might be offset by strengths on the other two fronts. But to be in a weak position on all three at once arguably had a ‘snowballing’ effect that was fatal to Labour’s chances of securing sufficient support to win.”Noting that the structure of the party is “far from transparent”, the authors commissioned a chart to show how it works, which uncovered at least five “executive directors”, at least 13 “directors”, and at least 15 “heads of”.This confusion and lack of coherence was, they say, “a central problem afflicting Labour’s ability to develop an election strategy and prepare to implement it”. This caused policy delays, for example, over Brexit, with the authors saying earlier clarity on the issue might have mitigated the party’s difficulties over the policy.The report also criticises the central policy on messaging, saying there was an overly rigid media strategy. The party’s online campaigning, much-praised in 2017, was not as good in 2019, while the Conservatives’ efforts in this area had greatly improved.This happened, the report says, “in the face of clear evidence available from the start that a far larger number of Labour seats were at risk”.It says that of 27 Labour-held seats lost narrowly to the Conservatives, 21 were not on an initial list of seats to be defended. The Tories won all of these by fewer than 700 votes, including Bury North and Bury South, Bolton North East, Stoke-on-Trent Central and Blyth Valley.In parallel to the isions over Brexit, the report finds Labour faced a gradual loss of voters more likely to be associated with the leave side – older, less educated and socially conservative.This was another ongoing process, the report notes, which had been masked by the relative success of the 2017 election, with much of it happening before 2019 and even before the Brexit referendum. Of those who voted Labour in 2010 but voted to leave in 2016, four in 10 had already stopped voting for the party by the time of the 2015 election.As Labour’s vote share evaporated in its heartland towns, more or less the only place it saw a rise in support was in or around large cities characterised by both high deprivation levels and many professional workers, and with high proportions of black, Asian and minority ethnic voters or students, such as London, Manchester, Leeds and Birmingham.This in part appeared to mean that any benefit to Labour from an influx of new voters was mainly felt in places where the party was already going to win. While the number of newly registered voters was higher in 2019 than in 2017 – 3.2 million against 2.3 million – and two-thirds were under 35, overall turnout fell slightly. While turnout was mainly seen in cities, it often fell in towns where Labour lost, such as Stoke-on-Trent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a390858227f35040b8c83e87708af437a136bb43/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c43d9dfc1a4150741780d738d935cdc1","title":"catch up funding for english schools wont start until september","story":"Education minister says heads will have to use own resources over the summerAn extra £650m funding to help pupils catch up on teaching missed during the coronavirus lockdown will only start to be distributed to schools in September, the education minister Nick Gibb has said.The funding is part of a £1bn “massive catch-up operation” for schools due to be announced by the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, later on Friday. Of the £1bn, £350m will subsidise a nationwide tutoring programme to help pupils most at need.Gibb, the minister for school standards, said on Friday the £650m could be used at the discretion of headteachers with advice from the Department for Education and the Education Endowment Foundation.He said the funding would start to be paid in the academic year starting in September, meaning schools will in the meantime have to use their own resources to provide catch-up classes over the summer holidays.Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Gibb said: “Schools will know it’s coming and they will be able to budget on that basis if they want to do things before September. But the money will start being distributed to schools, we’ll have more to say about that shortly, from the next academic year, September.”The funding announcement follows criticism that Boris Johnson’s government has failed to reopen schools quickly enough to avoid damaging the education of hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged pupils.He added: “We have over a million children now in our school system we’re doing so in a phased, careful approach because the safety of the teachers and pupils lies at the heart of all our decision-making.”The health secretary, Matt Hancock, told the daily Downing Street briefing on Thursday there would not be a return to full-time education in England until the virus was “under control”.There was disappointment for the early years sector after the government initially announced it would benefit from the £650m pot, as well as colleges.Following a clarification late on Thursday night that the money was going to state primary and secondary schools only, the Early Years Alliance said it “beggars belief” that the sector had been excluded.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Gibb said early years was “absolutely key” and that the government was working with experts on how best to support the under-fives and those aged 16 to 18 and “we’ll have more to say on that soon”.Gibb confirmed that just under half of the 230,000 laptops promised to vulnerable pupils had been delivered to local authorities – a figure disclosed earlier this week – but insisted the programme had been delivered on time.He added: “This is a fast-moving, very challenging set of circumstances that the government is facing – all governments around the world are facing. But we are delivering, we are doing the things that we need to do.“Obviously there are some things we can always do better but this is a government that’s working tirelessly to make sure that children’s education, while we’re during this crisis, continues as best we can.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3949e8e996ddaeb45c5b31405b78a8747ae7b4f/0_153_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d4faf7f0a8fbdc252b06bae7ba8c228","title":"uk rail bosses rejected call to dress staff like face mask volunteers","story":"Request came after Grant Shapps’ ‘army of journey makers’ in purple tabards failed to materialiseUK transport ministers asked train companies to dress staff in the purple tabards meant for “journey makers”, after the promised “army” of volunteers to remind travellers to wear a face covering failed to materialise this week.The last-minute request to keep up appearances, relayed to train operators by the Rail Delivery Group, was largely rejected by bosses, it has emerged.However, it is understood that some Network Rail staff were sent to locate the magenta Olympic Games Makers vests from London 2012, to coincide with the introduction of mandatory face coverings this week and busier rail services as some lockdown measures were eased.Invoking the spirit of the 2012 London Olympics, Shapps had announced in May that thousands of volunteers would be out to provide “reassurance and advice” to commuters and remind them to wear masks, which became mandatory on public transport on Monday. He said: “It will go a long way towards helping transport and passengers cope.”Later, he said the government would have “actually a whole army of volunteers … They’ll be wearing purple tabards and they will remind you to put your face covering on.”However, the initiative came as something of a surprise to the rail industry, which regarded the presence of untrained volunteers on stations during a pandemic as an unnecessary complication, and a potential safety risk.After the RMT union said it would ballot for a strike over the scheme, which it said was launched without consultation and would undercut safety-critical rail jobs, the charity tasked with staffing Shapps’s purple army, Volunteering Matters, decided to hold back until the row was resolved.Paul Reddish, the chief executive of Volunteering Matters, said there were still discussions ongoing with the Department for Transport, but there had been issues about where the 3,000 volunteers they were recruiting could be deployed around stations. He said: “They cannot substitute for paid roles, and we are not going where there are no rail staff. We’re ready to go, if indeed it gets to that stage, and the volunteers can have a good experience. But we’re not at that stage yet.”Shapps had first said that volunteers could appear as early as 1 June, but ministers had particularly targeted 15 June, when a big rise in passenger numbers was expected when lockdown restrictions were eased, and wearing face masks on public transport became mandatory.The DfT said it was aware of union concerns, and work was ongoing with Volunteering Matters and other organisations to establish where volunteers could add the most value to passenger journeys.The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “It is very clear that this is another government policy that was made up on the hoof to grab headlines, rather than actually sitting down and working through the consequences. Our position remains that we will take whatever action is required to prevent volunteers from being brought in as free labour on the railway.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2908be29f02f8bd5e839bbf6ecea690c41e66aa4/2_0_2595_1558/master/2595.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3df43c3196a94b903fe78d8b6a21ff73","title":"from bricks to clicks how local high street shops have turned digital during coronavirus","story":"Across the country, many independent retailers have had to switch to digital almost overnight in order to continue trading through the coronavirus lockdown. But as stores begin to reopen, will consumers now be as likely to shop online as in person?The coronavirus lockdown turned the lives of many high street merchants upside down overnight. For those who had little experience of online trading, or had business models that relied entirely on face-to-face sales, the challenge was sudden and daunting. But it was a challenge they knew they had to face.Before the pandemic, Georgina Black, who runs Pretty Shiny Shop, a small independent gift store in Finsbury Park, north London, did very little trade online. “I got maybe three sales a month through my website,” she says. “I didn’t regularly update it and I didn’t even list all my products. I can tell you that had to change fast when the lockdown started.”Since March, she has been painstakingly adding all her products, taking images of them, writing descriptions and listing measurements. “It’s time-consuming because I have no team, but I am starting to see the results. From an average of three sales per month I am now getting on average four or five a day.”After problems with couriers – one package she sent took 10 days to arrive – Black has experimented with different delivery options. She even bought an electric scooter so she could deliver local orders herself. “I’ve enjoyed zipping around the streets,” she says.While it is not clear exactly when trading will go back to normal, Black says that she will continue to push the online side of her business alongside reopening her doors. “It was never a priority before but now I need it to survive because, realistically, footfall is going to drop – people just aren’t going to be as comfortable going into shops. So shop owners need to adapt.”Once lockdown hit, owners of small businesses had to become digitally savvy – and fast. With high street stores having to turn bricks into clicks, Visa has teamed up with industry partners to offer support to them. It hopes to help small businesses across the UK find new and different ways to serve the local people and communities that rely on them.One of Visa’s partners is Shopify, a leading e-commerce platform that powers more than 1m businesses worldwide. With the backing of Visa, Shopify has offered a 14-day free trial for all new small businesses and provided support from experts who can guide, advise, and get small businesses online.Black, who built her website using Shopify, is very much a fan of the platform. “I love Shopify,” she says. “I find it incredibly easy to deal with at the back end. I’m not a very technical person but making changes and adding products really is a breeze.”Visa has also joined forces with Deliveroo. The delivery service has waived the £50 sign-up fee for up to 1,000 small and medium-sized restaurants until 30 June – or on whichever date before then all 1,000 waivers have been taken up – it has also provided a cash payment of £500 to 200 existing small and medium-sized restaurant partners so they could continue operating during coronavirus.More than ever, the platform is helping businesses continue to reconnect with their local communities. The social psychologist and founder of ShopAppy, Jackie Mulligan, says the “resilience and determination” of local businesses during the crisis has been “inspiring”.Independent businesses are the heartbeat of our high streets and local communities, and the backbone of the UK economy. “We keep the local high street looking good and lively,” says Black. “I’ve been so impressed by how the local community has supported local shops. It’s so heartening.”When small, local businesses succeed, everyone in the community reaps the rewards. Recent months have been enormously challenging for them, but with the right support from local customers, online platforms and Visa alike, they can survive and thrive.Shop local.

Many have opted to support local retailers, but can that trend last?Like other shops throughout the UK, the Edward Street Bakery in the West Yorkshire village of Saltaire has been closed throughout lockdown. But as it told its followers on social media “bakers gotta bake (and cook)”, so it has been running bake-a-longs via its Instagram account. From brownies to a peanut butter cornflake tart, fans have been able to join bakery staff in creating their own goodies at home. And as well as keeping customers happy it’s also inadvertently supporting other local businesses as the ingredients for the bake-a-longs can be bought from Mr Whetstone – a local refill shop.Although this might stand out for sounding particularly delicious, it’s far from an isolated instance of an independent retailer finding innovative ways to connect with customers while its doors are closed. Across the country, store owners have shown ingenuity – and the public has been falling back in love with their local high streets as a result.For many years, the fate of the British high street has been a staple of magazine features and newspaper business page reports alike. Yet, in what is perhaps one of the biggest surprises of 2020 – and there have been many – rather than being the death knell for the local shopping scene, coronavirus appears to have sparked a renaissance. Although some stores will not be lifting their shutters when regular trading resumes, others have seen a spike in business.A witness to this shift in shopping habits is Jackie Mulligan, founder of the digital platform ShopAppy, which allows consumers to connect with their local high street online. She says this shift towards shopping locally was initially driven by practicalities.“The sea change that we saw at the beginning of lockdown was a result of the big superstores being unable to give people delivery slots and people didn’t feel safe going into those stores,” says Mulligan. As a result, there was a sudden discovery of local shops, she says.ShopAppy itself experienced a huge growth in customer registrations as people looked for new ways to shop for groceries and essential goods. Over time, these same customers have begun to look for other products too, with gifts and even art becoming more popular. Mulligan says that two-thirds of artists who participated in this year’s online version of a local Makers’ Fair made sales.Furthermore, these new customers are discovering that the local stores have a lot to offer. “They’re reporting that they couldn’t believe how good the fruit and veg was,” says Mulligan, adding that customers have also been wowed by the prices and lack of packaging.Ensuring new habits stickThe challenge for local shop owners is to ensure that this shift in consumer spending habits continues longer term. How can they capitalise on this current upsurge?Retailers need to act now, says Mulligan. “You can close your shop but still trade. You can close your cafe but still offer something. The key is to make it easy for customers to support local.”The Edward Street Bakery offers one example of how to do this other examples include allowing customers to ring up with orders or book appointments to visit the store.Another option is to take advantage of the special offer to join ShopAppy for free until the end of July and connect with local consumers through that platform. “However ambitious you are, it’s difficult to save the high street on your own,” says Mulligan.“People have turned to corner shops and local shops and we don’t want them to go back to old habits. We want them to have a bit more of a local choice when doing their shopping – supporting local is for life, not just for lockdown.”Shop local.

Average attendance at major league ballparks hit a 16-year low in 2019. Little League participation is down. A Gallup poll shows baseball, which ceded the practical if not symbolic mantle of national pastime to the NFL decades ago, is falling behind basketball in popularity among fans in the United States. The median age of fans for last year’s World Series inched upward yet again from the year before to 56.9.Anecdotally, I’d venture to guess the average person on the street couldn’t name 10 current players.And yet MLB’s gross revenues, which include league-wide multimedia contracts worth guaranteed billions and often lucrative broadcasting deals at the local level that leverage the sport’s robust regional audiences, have enjoyed steady growth over the past decade and a half, climbing to a record $10.7bn last year. Only last week, MLB agreed to a cable TV rights deal with Turner worth $3.2bn.It’s against this curious backdrop – a short-term bull market under a long-term bearish trend – that MLB finds itself mired in a wildly self-destructive stalemate between the owners and the players that threatens to drag it toward the margins for good.Baseball had a golden opportunity to become the first major American sport to return from the coronavirus pandemic, offering a sense of normalcy and healing amid the national trauma of the last three months. And that’s putting aside the obvious self-interest of having the stage to itself before a captive audience, reconnecting with lapsed fans and getting in front of the younger eyeballs it’s desperate to attract while ESPN has resorted to airing marble racing and cherry-pit spitting.The players claim they’re being shortchanged with their pro-rated salaries, being made to subsidize the owners’ anticipated losses (with increased health risk) after years of not tasting the profits, and have made no secret of their willingness to take their ball and go home. The owners claim the pay cut is necessary given the lower-than-expected revenues with ticket sales out of the equation. But as both sides have dug in and spent months trading offers and counter-proposals, the NBA, NHL and MLS have put together plans to restart in July with a fraction of the hassle, while boxing, mixed martial arts, the PGA Tour and Nascar have all adapted on the fly and found ways to resume activity without fans.Baseball has been here before, done in from within by ego and greed. The infamous work stoppage during the homestretch of the 1994 season led to the cancellation of the World Series for the first time in 90 years, an unforced error it took the sport a decade to recover from. Yet there’s every reason to believe it would face a steeper uphill climb in today’s climate if that doomsday scenario were to repeat itself. Baseball games are longer and slower than ever before at a time when young people are growing up on the commercial-less experiences served up by MLS and the Premier League, which airs matches on free-to-air NBC. The gravity of these existential problems is almost enough to make us forget the sport is fresh off a sign-stealing scandal that’s embroiled two of the last three champions and shaken the public trust in the game.A year without MLB could drive home a point that no one involved should want in the public domain: that we can live without it. While baseball’s place in our past is indelible, far less certain is where it belongs in our future. Both sides have made it clear they’re taking its place in the American consciousness for granted. After punting on its time to shine and an unprecedented opportunity to bring in new fans and , baseball can only shift its focusing on holding on to the ones it’s got."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30d434a0eaebf8ebee7cd86020233412c36cdaf/0_77_5351_3214/master/5351.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d059a3c3a5b5d2580b4c8ed02762fe0a","title":"royal ascot day four horse racing commonwealth cup live updates","story":"It’s a slightly downbeat renewal of this top-class sprint for three-year-olds, lacking a star name like Limato, Caravaggio or Ten Sovereigns (I realise two of them were beaten in this). Of course, we’ve missed a section of the season that might have generated stardom. Pierre Lapin is the nearest thing we have, thanks to the memory of his promising Mill Reef success. Kimari showed her ability to run fast on this ground when second in the Queen Mary last year, though this extra furlong will be a test for her. Golden Horde was just a neck behind Earthlight in the Middle Park, though, as he returns from a nine-month absence, it’s a concern that his stable has been a bit quiet. Lope Y Fernandez ran a big race to be third in the Irish Guineas and that form was boosted by Thursday’s effort from Monarch Of Egypt still, Lope Y Fernandez may have had a harder race on The Curragh than that one. The return to sprinting also looks a good idea for Millisle but she ran a long way below expectation in the 1,000 Guineas. Southern Hills lacks a recent run but won last year’s Windsor Castle on similar ground and could be a lively outsider.They’re off ... Communique leads from Alounak ... Elarqam and Anthony Van Dyck are close up ... Van Dyck being pushed along ... Fanny Logan is coming ... and leads and goes clear ... Frankie Dettori has another winner!Richard Hannon’s travelling head lad Wayne Kavanagh was left with a dislocated knee after an incident with the stable’s Albany Stakes runner Cirrus in the parade ring at Royal Ascot. Kavanagh, a former jump jockey, was leading the juvenile filly round the paddock when she became fractious.The incident helped to cause a near seven-minute delay to the second race on day four of the famous meeting, before Cirrus went on to finish 12th of 13 behind easy winner Dandalla.Derby winners in the Hardwicke are apparently becoming a thing, since we had Masar in this last year. Hopefully things go better for Anthony Van Dyck, as Masar just about fell over on emerging from the stalls, finished fifth and was retired after one more race. Anthony Van Dyck has better prospects, having shown up well when second in the Coronation Cup a fortnight ago, with Straarius behind in third. But this is a strong field, he’s on a six-race losing run and was said to need fast ground when he was 10th in the King George here last year. Defoe looked useful in winning this last year and he should be sharper for his Coronation Cup fifth his yard has come right into form. The famously mudloving Morando needs the ground to stay testing, as a few of these are more talented in normal circumstances and there is no juice in his price after it halved last night. Elarqam is a more convincing candidate after his staying-on second to Lord North 12 days ago, that rival having since landed the Prince of Wales. A Group Two winner at York on soft ground last summer, Elarqam was beaten just over a length in the Juddmonte International and he can cap a huge week for Jim Crowley. Hamish has been backed, presumably because soft suits him well, but he has a bit to prove at this level and may be better for this first run back.Jockeys riding at Royal Ascot on Saturday have come together and agreed to donate their riding fees to the NHS, in recognition of the dedication and amazing work of all NHS staff throughout the Covid-19 crisis and for the outstanding care they provide to injured jockeys.The initiative was the brainchild of jockey Martin Dwyer, who won the Group Two King Edward VII Stakes at Ascot on Tuesday on Pyledriver, trainer by his father-in-law William Muir.Dwyer, who is also a director of the PJA, said: “We wanted to do something to recognise all of our amazing NHS staff who’ve worked tirelessly throughout this crisis, especially as jockeys rely on the NHS whenever we have a fall and the overwhelming majority of racecourse medical staff also work in the NHS. We owe them a huge debt of gratitude and this is our way of saying thank you.” Paul Struthers, chief executive of the PJA, said:“The medical provision on the racecourse, provided by doctors and nurses who also work in the NHS, is the best in the world. Our jockeys also receive first class care from the NHS and its staff when they are injured in a fall, as happened to one of our members earlier this week. It therefore doesn’t surprise me in the slightest that jockeys would come up with an initiative like this themselves and it’s a wonderful gesture.”They’re off ... Golden Pal blazes into the lead ... Eye Of Heaven there with The Lir Jet ... Golden Pal gets weary and The Lir Jet got up in the last 20 yards to win.Technician has been retired after injuring a tendon in the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot. Martyn Meade’s four-year-old was sent off the 7-2 second favourite on the back of several good efforts last year, but he put up a disappointing display in conditions that should have suited him well on Thursday.Unfortunately, on returning to Meade’s Manton base, it transpired Technician had torn a tendon badly enough for his racing days to be over.Meade said: “After the race we found out he’d suffered a tendon injury, and I’m afraid it’s career-threatening, so we’ve decided he will be retired. His run was so inexplicable – he had absolutely perfect conditions, and I was expecting a big run. It’s so disappointing. It shows what a good horse he was to run on with that injury – it’s bad.“There’s no future trying to repair it, so we’ll have to make alternative plans for him now. Hopefully he can go to stud, but I’m afraid that will be his last race. We knew something was wrong, because that wasn’t like him at all. Usually he battles on – and with conditions right, something had to be affecting him. Clearly he must have twisted badly, and that was it.” PA MediaHaving saddled the second and fourth in the Chesham, Mark Johnston hopes to win this two-year-old race with Eye Of Heaven, one of the most impressive of the 20-odd winners he’s had since resumption. The third horse, Tactical, won the Windsor Castle earlier this week, but wet ground presents a different test. It is even more likely to be a problem for Golden Pal, reckoned by Wesley Ward to be his best chance of the week but a beautiful mover on a fast surface. Lipizzaner, the Aidan O’Brien runner, was straight enough to make his debut in March but didn’t show much improvement for that experience when he ran again 11 days ago. The Lir Jet knew his job when scoring at Yarmouth and, while the ground was quick, his sire won a soft-ground Norfolk, so this colt may be able to cope. Nelson Gay, third that day, could improve enough to make it closer this time. Imperial Force is another likely improve, having chased home Godolphin’s Coventry Stakes contender at Newmarket. He’s bred to like this ground.Looking back, Dandalla was pretty impressive there in the Albany Stakes and has a 16-1 quote for the 1,000 Guineas from Betfair after that victory.1 Dandalla (B A Curtis) 13-22 Setarhe (Andrea Atzeni) 11-4 Fav3 Mother Earth (R L Moore) 10-313 ranAlso: 20-1 Undertake 4thNon Runner: No13 Ventura Vision (50-1) was withdrawn not under orders.They’re off ... gone without Ventura Vision ...

She doubled in price to 8-1 after the rain arrived on Thursday. Going the other way in the betting was Golden Melody, a daughter of Belardo, who won a soft-ground Dewhurst. There was some dig when she scored at Haydock, quickening nicely a furlong out. Aidan O’Brien sends Mother Earth, who ran on kindly into second in the first Irish race after resumption last week. Soft ground will help her. Improvement also seems likely from Mahale, who was flying at the finish when fourth on her debut, doing much the best of the hold-up runners. The greater emphasis on stamina here is good news for her.Once again, we kick off with a fiendish new handicap ... well, not that new as there used to be a three-year-old sprint handicap at the Royal meeting, called the Balmoral, but it disappeared some years ago. The clear favourite is Art Power, nicely bred and impressive so far, powering well clear on his Newcastle reappearance. You could worry about stable form, as Tim Easterby has been short of winners, but this grey looked really good just 18 days ago. Down at the bottom of the weights, there’s a couple of contenders. Dancin Inthestreet met trouble in running at Haydock, when five furlongs looked on the sharp side for her this five is stiffer, though. Never Dark is from a zippy family and his mum won the Wokingham 13 years back. He made all at Kempton on his handicap debut but this is his first turf start. Maystar won in Qatar in December and went close in a French Listed race in March, so he won’t wilt for lack of experience.Hayley Turner has tweeted her thanks for all the congratulations following her success at Royal Ascot yesterdayA traditional flutter for racegoers in the build up to the action is the colour of the Queen’s hat, and I’ve been told that in the absence of the Royal Procession, Bettingexpert have started putting together a fun set of odds for ITV Racing’s Francesca Cumani’s headpiece.

After all, his career total at the Royal meeting was five but three of those came last year and perhaps that should have been the sign that he’s going to be a perennial contender now. O’Brien has four seconds, more than the top two put together, so he’ll be in pole position if he can get to the same winner total as them, and he has plenty of bullets yet to fire.

He has had an amazing week and it would be cruel if he did not now end it as top jockey, but, looking at the bookings for the next two days, Moore is still a live runner. Dettori got his second winner of the week in the Gold Cup and has plenty to be satisfied about but it seems we are not going to get a repeat of last year’s heroics. Rossa Ryan got his first winner at the Royal meeting, while Hayley Turner has now won the Sandringham two years in a row and both times at 33-1. Tom Marquand is still waiting for his first winner here he’s had a couple of seconds this week and gets four more chances today, including on Born With Pride, the likely favourite for the Queen’s Vase.Top jockey best odds:4-6 Crowley, 9-4 Moore, 12-1 Doyle, 20-1 Dettori.Ascot clerk of the course Chris Stickels has been out on the track and has the latest update on the going and conditions1.15pm Palace Of Holyroodhouse HandicapArt Power 2-11.50pm Albany StakesMahale 10-1 (14s in places)2.25pm Norfolk StakesImperial Force 9-13.00pm Hardwicke StakesElarqam 5-23.35pm Commonwealth CupPierre Lapin 4-14.10pm Queen’s VaseBerkshire Rocco (nap) 4-14.40pm Duke Of Edinburgh HandicapGood Birthday (nb) 8-1Most of these are proving fairly popular, with the exception of Pierre Lapin. It’s odds to see some opposition to him, given how hot Roger Varian has been this week.After what was basically a dry night at Ascot, the official going for day four of the Royal meeting has been changed to good-to-soft on the straight course and soft, good-to-soft in place on the round, which is, by my count at least, the fifth change since Tuesday morning (and please don’t write to the editor if I’ve managed to miss a couple, it’s been that kind of week).The TurfTrax map on the Ascot going hub shows the contrast between the rate of drainage on the straight – which was relaid when the course was rebuilt from scratch 15 years ago – and the loop for the longer races, which wasn’t. The difference between the two is likely to increase over the next couple of days if, as expected, further rain is sporadic, but that does not matter quite so much today as the feature event – the Group One Commonwealth Cup – is a six-furlong sprint for three-year-olds.This is the youngest of the Group One races at the meeting, having been introduced – and, a little controversially, immediately awarded the coveted Group One status – in 2015. It has since fully justified that decision, however, rapidly becoming one of the highlights of the week.This year’s renewal is another cracker, bringing together horses that have been aimed at this race for many months (Pierre Lapin, Golden Horde) alongside others that tried their luck in a Guineas at Newmarket or the Curragh and did not quite get home. With Kimari, from Wesley Ward’s stable in the States, adding a transatlantic interest with Frankie Dettori up, it promises to be some spectacle.It really is now or never for any jockey hoping to overhaul Jim Crowley’s total of six winners so far and claim the prize for the leading rider of the week, as Crowley has just two rides today – including Elarqam, the favourite for the Hardwicke Stakes – while James Doyle has five mounts, and Ryan Moore and Frankie Dettori have six apiece.Crowley is a 4-7 chance to become the jockey other than Moore, Dettori and Johnny Murtagh to win the prize since 2007, while Moore – who rides Anthony Van Dyck, last year’s Derby winner and the second-favourite, in Elarqam’s race – is 9-4, with Doyle at 12-1 and Dettori on 20-1. If Elarqam wins, it is probably game over.Chris Cook’s selections for the fourth day are here, and the action is underway at 1.15."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/062bc6080733b47702b23be89a3e67e08afe9aba/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db8dfe8d084f6f0cf39625efae0041c9 700w","title":"abandoned bus made famous movie book into the wild removed by alaska mccandless","story":"Helicopter removed the bus where adventurer Christopher McCandless died of starvation in 1992, to prevent others trying to reach it An abandoned bus in the Alaska back country, popularized by the book Into the Wild and movie of the same name, was removed on Thursday as a public safety measure, state officials said. The bus has long attracted adventurers to an area without cellphone service and marked by unpredictable weather and at-times swollen rivers. Some have had to be rescued or have died. Christopher McCandless, the subject of the book and movie, died of starvation there in 1992. The rescue earlier this year of five Italian tourists and death last year of a woman from Belarus intensified calls from local officials for the bus, about 25 miles (40km) from the Parks Highway, to be removed. The Alaska natural resources commissioner, Corri Feige, said the Alaska Army National Guard moved the bus as part of a training mission “at no cost to the public or additional cost to the state”. The Alaska National Guard, in a release, said the bus was removed using a heavy-lift helicopter. The crew ensured the safety of a suitcase with sentimental value to the McCandless family, the release said.Feige said in a statement the bus would be kept in a secure location while her department weighed various options for what to do with it. “We encourage people to enjoy Alaska’s wild areas safely, and we understand the hold this bus has had on the popular imagination,” her statement said. “However, this is an abandoned and deteriorating vehicle that was requiring dangerous and costly rescue efforts. More importantly, it was costing some visitors their lives.” McCandless, a 24-year-old from Virginia, was prevented from seeking help by the swollen banks of the Teklanika River. He wrote in a journal about living in the bus for 114 days, right up to his death. The long-abandoned Fairbanks city bus became famous as a result of the 1996 book by Jon Krakauer, and a 2007 Sean Penn-directed movie, also called Into the Wild. The Department of Natural Resources said the 1940s-era bus had been used by a construction company to house employees during work on an access road in the area and was abandoned when the work was finished in 1961. In March, officials in the Denali Borough based in Healy, about 25 miles from the bus, voted unanimously to be rid of it.

And in April, more than 200 black women leaders and activists within the Democratic party signed an open letter calling on Biden to choose a black woman, noting that “the road to the White House is powered by black women and black women are the key to a Democratic victory in 2020”.Klobuchar, a white, moderate Democrat, has recently had to contend with her past as a prosecutor in the county that includes Minneapolis, where George Floyd was killed. During her tenure, Klobuchar declined to prosecute police accused of using excessive force against black suspects. More than two dozen mostly black and minority people died during encounters with police.Klobuchar, 60, was among a large field of Democrats who had sought the 2020 presidential nomination, running as a pragmatic Midwesterner who had passed over 100 bills. She dropped out and threw her support behind Biden before the crucial 3 March “Super Tuesday” contests after struggling to win support from black voters, who remain crucial to Democratic victories. Her best finish of the primary was in overwhelmingly white New Hampshire, where she came in third.The senator had to cancel one of her final campaign rallies after Black Lives Matter and other activists took the stage in Minnesota to protest her handling as prosecutor of a murder case that sent a black teenager to prison for life.Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, a Biden ally and highest-ranking black person in Congress, said in the days after Floyd’s death that “this is very tough timing” for Klobuchar.During the 11th Democratic presidential debate, after Klobuchar had dropped out, Biden explicitly committed to picking a woman as vice president and nominating the first African American woman to the supreme court.Klobuchar, who has been an enthusiastic campaign surrogate for Biden, indicated she will continue to support him. In the interview with MSNBC, Klobuchar brushed aside the suggestion that her record as a prosecutor would have affected her ability to function as Biden’s running mate.“I think I could have functioned fine,” she said. “There’s a lot of untruths out there about my record and now is not the time to debate them.”After the interview aired, senior Biden adviser Symone Sanders indicated that she expected Klobuchar back on the campaign trail."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7335c8af40c0db99992784384dc252fd2f9082d/0_422_4803_2884/master/4803.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50db62e825dbc7ee4dc2f3b949b35efd","title":"tell us how has coronavirus affected people living in the north east","story":"We’d like to hear from people in the north-east and Yorkshire about the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreakWe would like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.We’d like to hear from people in north-east England including the county of Yorkshire and we’re particularly interested finding out how the pandemic has affected your work and the local economy.

Even so, they can’t help relishing the tranquility that Spain’s strict Covid-19 lockdown has brought to the archipelago.That tranquility came to a necessary end on Monday, when thousands of German tourists began arriving on the islands as part of a pilot programme to reactivate Spain’s tourism sector.“If there are no tourists, there’s no jobs,” said Mercedes. “And without the Germans, there’s no work.”It is no exaggeration. In 2018, 4.9 million Germany tourists visited the Balearics, more than from any other country. Not for nothing is Mallorca known as the 17th state of Germany.The main streets by the beach in Palma are nicknamed Schinkenstraße (Ham street) and Bierstraße (Beer street), while the party mile by the sand has long gone by the infamous title of Ballermann – German wordplay on slang terms for getting legless and letting go.However, the reason for welcoming Germans back first is not solely economic. The German holiday-makers arriving on 47 flights have been allowed to return because their country’s epidemiological situation is similar to that of the Balearics – and better than the UK’s.Only a few hundred have arrived so far but they’re not hard to spot. Such has been the media interest in the pilot programme that almost every tourist is accompanied by their own camera crew.The broadcaster ARD was there to record the first beach trip of Thomas and Karina Wiendandt, a couple from Finsterwalde in Brandenburg: “It’s raining at home but it’s sunny here!”Bild, meanwhile, documented how Ela and Jörg Hauser from Cologne sipped their first beers while reclining in physically distanced hammocks: “The quality-to-price ratio is amazing!”And then there were Joachim and Anne Hagen, who speak only to the print media: “We’ve come here because it’s quiet. We normally avoid areas such as Ballermann.”Xevi Molas, a psychologist, has been watching the media show with an ironic smile. Having lived by the S’Arenal beach for 34 years, he’s something of an expert on its German visitors.“If they’re young and in a group, all sense of inidual responsibility is dispensed with – and our beautiful beach gets turned into a sewer,” said Molas.Last year he and some friends got so fed up with the summer excesses that they organised a small flashmob.Both the plan and its execution were simple: Molas and 15 others marched on to the beach armed with containers of tortilla de patatas and gazpacho and made straight for the heart of the drunken, sunburned German throng.After sitting down to enjoy their picnic, chatting, and going for a dip, the party set about picking up rubbish from the beach.“They were gobsmacked,” said Molas. “Our aim was to show them the kind of tourism we want on the island: something polite and respectful.”Molas, whose father was a hotelier, is convinced that “another kind of tourism is possible” – and that the pandemic could yet be the catalyst.He is not alone. The regional government of the Balearic islands recently issued a decree banning pub crawls, happy hours and other activities that tend to result in massive alcohol consumption.Today, the move seems a little unnecessary. The virus and the subsequent lockdown have solved the problem in one fell swoop. The doors of bars and clubs such as Bierkönig and Mega-Park are closed, at least for now.The only place open on Schinkenstraße is the San Siro, which is mainly frequented by locals. Martin Funke was leaning against the bar, smoking his first cigarette of the morning. He works for the Grillmeister chain – which specialises in German sausage – and was in a dark mood.“The tourists they’ve brought us are not our target market,” he complained. “And the others won’t come now. The whole season’s been lost.”He lit up another cigarette and added: “The party’s over. Ballermann is dead.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c33d997792057d949de3e3deb9e587ea42b195a9/0_284_4826_2896/master/4826.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7160b5fa0e90bc36504b2a47f8e4341d","title":"coronavirus covid 19 live news update us questions beijing cluster figures who vaccine doses latest updates","story":"Saudi Arabia case total passes 150,000 researchers working on more than 200 vaccines, says WHO global deaths pass 450,000Chinese state media is reporting that a coronavirus vaccine that is being developed may not be ready for sale until at least 2021, as researchers struggle to move into large-scale human trials in the country because of a lack of new infections, a senior company executive said.More than 10 experimental vaccines are being tested in humans globally as scientists race to protect against the novel coronavirus that has killed more than 450,000 people.But none of them has yet passed late-stage phase 3 trials that require thousands of participants to determine a vaccine candidate’s effectiveness.China, where the virus first originated last year, saw less than 10 new local cases reported daily on average in May, making it less favourable for a late-stage clinical trial.“We hope we can launch more international cooperations and conduct a multiple-centre phase 3 clinical study to help bring the vaccine to the market,” China National Biotec Group’s (CNBG) vice president Zhang Yutao told state media China News Service.“The vaccine won’t be on the market until at least next year based on current plans,” he said in the interview broadcast late on Thursday.A new outbreak in the capital Beijing city last week has infected more than 180 people, but Yang said the number of new patients compared with the population was still too low to make it an ideal trial site.The number of coronavirus cases in Saudi Arabia exceeded 150,000 on Friday following a rise in new infections over the past 10 days.The Saudi ministry of health reported 4,301 new cases on Friday, taking the total to 150,292, with 1,184 deaths. The country hit more than 100,000 cases on 7 June.The number of new infections has continued to rise in recent weeks, as authorities began phasing out restrictions on movement and travel on 28 May. The restrictions were imposed in March to help curb the spread of the virus. Authorities announced last month that the nationwide curfew would be lifted completely on 21 June, with the exception of the holy city of Mecca and Jeddah.Saudi Arabia is considering drastically limiting numbers at the annual haj pilgrimage to prevent a further outbreak of coronavirus cases, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this month.Some 2.5 million pilgrims visit the holiest sites of Islam in Mecca and Medina for the weeklong hajj, a once-in-a-lifetime duty for every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it. Saudi Arabia asked Muslims in March to put hajj plans on hold and suspended the umrah pilgrimage until further notice.Saudi Arabia’s numbers are the highest in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which have recorded 366,677 cases and 2,072 deaths.Spain expects a decision in the coming hours in its talks with Britain on whether to establish a travel corridor to avoid imposing a quarantine on travelers due to the coronavirus pandemic, a Spanish foreign ministry source said on Friday.“Spain is willing to be open to the United Kingdom. We are in talks with them about their quarantine. We are in a position to open without a quarantine,” the source added.Spain will open its borders to tourists from most European countries on Sunday.Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, is expected to announce on 29 June that agreements have been reached for air bridges with a “small number” of countries with low levels of the coronavirus outbreak. The Foreign Office has been urged by a cross party group of British MPs to intervene to secure the safety of three prominent Gulf human rights activists thought to be at risk from the coronavirus outbreak strengthening in the region and present in some prisons. The signatories include Peter Bottomley, the father of the house and Caroline Lucas, the Green Party MP.Brendan O’Hara MP, Argyll \u0026amp Bute, Chair of the all party group on Democracy and Human Rights in the Gulf said “With Brexit fast approaching, it is paramount that human rights are at the centre of UK foreign policy. The government has too often turned a blind eye to the plight of imprisoned human rights defenders in the Gulf and with COVID-19 now posing an unprecedented imminent threat to their lives, it is time to take a stand and call for their immediate release”The family of one of the three activists Loujain al Hathloul, a women’s rights campaigner is Saudi Arabia say they have not heard from her for a month. She has been held in the Saudi Arabia’s maximum security al-Ha’ir prison complex near Riyadh for more than two years. The UN working group on arbitrary detention called for her immediate release this week. After a dip in cases in Saudi at the beginning of June, the number of new daily cases this week reached record levels of 4,919. Total deaths are 1,139.Concern is also being expressed for Ahmed Mansoor handed a 10 year sentence by the United Arab Emirates for “insulting the rank and reputation of the UAE and their symbols” and “disseminating false information to damage the United Arab Emirates’ reputation abroad”. Despite successive hunger strikes, he has been held in solitary confinement and is said to have neither a bed nor access to water. His state of health has deteriorated sharply, his supporters said. New coronavirus cases in the UAE has been declining until the last few days, but Human Rights Watch has reported outbreaks in UAE jails. Total deaths across the UAE has reached 298.The third activist for which concern has been expressed is Abduljalil Al Singace, a Bahrain activist sentenced to life for criticising the government. Bahraini activist Maryam Al Khawaja, whose father Abdulhadi Al Khawaja is also at Jau Prison along with Al Singace, reported that there are confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the prison.Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain is thought to have presided over one of the most effective attempts to combat coronavirus with only 55 deaths, but there has been a spike this week in new cases with a record 786 new infections on June 15.Partly on the advice of British public health advisers, the King has pardoned 901 prisoners while more than 500 more will be allowed to serve out their sentences outside prisons.A persistent several hundred new coronavirus cases per day and a growing outbreak after a party in the Algarve region are threatening Portugal’s image as a safe holiday destination. However the country’s foreign ministry argued the new cases do not mean Portugal is unsafe, saying the numbers were due to a higher rate of testing than most EU members. Portugal ranks sixth in Europe in its testing rate, at 98,700 per million inhabitants and its number of coronavirus deaths and infections are far lower than in neighbouring Spain, even considering its smaller population.Denmark said on Thursday it would not allow entry to travellers from Portugal despite opening up to most other European nations from 27 June. Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Lithuania have placed conditions on re-entry of travellers from Portugal such as quarantine, testing and self-isolation.“Naturally, if the current situation doesn’t change, Portugal reserves the right to apply the principle of reciprocity,” the ministry said in a statement.A total of 69 new cases have been confirmed in and around Lagos, a tourist town in the Algarve, traced back to a birthday party in the area attended by up to 100 people a fortnight ago.The Spanish health ministry has just updated the country’s Covid-19 death toll to 28,313 after leaving the figure frozen at 27,136 for almost two weeks while it checked and analysed the data.The government had been widely criticised for “pausing” the death figures on 7 June, but had defended the move on the grounds that it needed to “review the information on deaths” and establish the date of death, rather than when the death was reported.Statistics on infections and deaths are collected by each of Spain’s 17 autonomous regions and then given to the central government in Madrid.Towards the end of May, the health ministry changed its methods for collecting data on cases and deaths, leading to a sharp drop in daily cases and some days when no deaths were reported – despite regional governments reporting fatalities over the same period.The government argued that the changes had been needed to help it pin down and isolate new outbreaks rather than focusing on the overall picture.On Friday, the health minister, Salvador Illa, said there have been 34 small outbreaks involving 982 inidual cases in Spain over the past four to six weeks. He added that all of the outbreaks were now under control.Most of the outbreaks were detected among people who had flouted the lockdown to gather for parties, among people working in slaughterhouses, or among seasonal workers or those returning from working abroad.The government says it is still working to process and provide figures on the number of people who have died from the coronavirus in Spanish care homes. Deaths in homes for elderly or disabled people are expected to account for a significant proportion of all deaths.Of the 15,043 people who have died from the virus or with associated symptoms in the Madrid region alone, 5,981 were in residential homes.Mortality figures from the Carlos III research institute in Madrid show that there were 43,360 “excess deaths” – more fatalities than would normally have been expected – in Spain between 13 March and 22 May.Sources said that many of the remaining deaths could be down to the virus, but noted that the figures could also be skewed by the fact that many people had been too scared to go to hospital during the height of the pandemic, and may have died at home from strokes or heart attacks as a result.This is Nazia Parveen taking the reins of the global coronavirus liveblog for the afternoon.

A total of 2,470 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by six from 2,464 on Thursday, Nicola Sturgeon said.Speaking at the Scottish government’s virtual coronavirus briefing, the first minister said 18,104 people have tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by 27 from 18,077 the previous day.There are 904 people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, a decrease of 25 in 24 hours. Of these patients, 19 were in intensive care, down by four.Shops in Wales are set to reopen on Monday. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said the “R” rate in Wales continues to be below 1 and the number of deaths reported every day is at the lowest point since lockdown began.Each of the different nations in the UK are in charge of their own coronavirus lockdown restrictions, and this week has seen the lockdown eased slightly in Scotland and Northern Ireland.Drakeford says restrictions in Wales will be eased gradually over the next three weeks, with changes coming in on every Monday:Coronavirus is not over. Every day people are being infected.The European Central Bank’s chief warned EU leaders on Friday that their economies were heading for a “dramatic fall” due to the coronavirus crisis and urged them to agree quickly on a massive stimulus plan currently under discussion.Her stark message came as the European Union’s 27 leaders settled in at their computer screens for a day of discussions on recovery for their bloc.It’s a crisis without precedent that has had an enormous impact - economic, social and also on the viability of the EU. To show that Europe protects, we cannot take any longer on this, as delays will only make things more difficult and more expensive.Sources said Lagarde told the summit that financial markets were relatively calm because of expectations that they would act to show “the EU is back” in action.Fragile gains in women’s workforce participation across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are at risk, while gender-based violence is on the rise, and women’s voices are going unheard, according to a new report from CARE International. CARE’s rapid gender analysis provides a sobering picture of the pandemic’s impact on women and girls across the region.The Covid-19 pandemic and efforts at mitigating the virus’ spread in recent months have heightened the insecurity, psychosocial distress, economic vulnerability, gender inequality, and deprivation that already existed in countries in the Middle East and beyond. While men appear to have worse outcomes when infected with the coronavirus, women and girls are being deeply impacted– and fragile gains in women’s workforce participation are in jeopardy.Serbia will hold Europe’s first national election on Sunday since the continent went into coronavirus lockdown three months ago, with protective masks made available to voters at polling stations to guard against the spread of Covid-19.Serbia, with a population of 7.2 million, has so far reported 12,616 confirmed cases of Covid-19, with 258 deaths.Shops and cafes have reopened in Singapore from today as coronavirus measures are relaxed - but the city-state’s leader warned people “not to go overboard celebrating”.More than two months after a partial lockdown was imposed, massage parlours and spas also resumed operations while beaches were no longer off limits and sports and other facilities opened again.“I feel happy because I can come out … a few restrictions still apply but I’m happy, I feel safe,” Mostafa Jamshidian, a computer science researcher, told AFP as he walked through the central business district.Angelica Stasevich said she was “very happy”. “Today it’s like I want to sing, I want to dance, I want to walk,” the 21-year-old said.Social gatherings of up to five are allowed under the relaxed rules, but people must wear face masks and stay 1 metre (3.3ft) apart.Authorities have been gradually easing restrictions imposed in early April that shuttered schools and non-essential businesses, as a test-and-trace effort stabilised infection rates.The city-state’s 5.7 million residents had been told to stay home unless they had good reason to go out.Singapore has the second-highest number of confirmed infections in south-east Asia with more than 41,000 cases, mostly among foreign workers living in crowded dormitories. The death toll stands at 26.In a Facebook post marking the reopening of most businesses, the prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, said: I am sure all of us have been eagerly looking forward to this day for a long time! But please don’t go overboard celebrating.Potential super-spreader venues such as cinemas, bars and nightclubs remain closed.Iran has released its latest coronavirus figures, saying that in the last 24 hours 2,615 new cases of the disease were reported.A further 120 people have died, said a spokesman for the country’s ministry of health.Iran was one of the worst affected countries early on in the pandemic.People with a south Asian background are the most likely group to die from Covid-19 after being admitted to hospital across the UK, according to a study.EU leaders are gathering virtually for a video summit that is attempting to find consensus for an ambitious €750bn (£676bn $840bn) EU coronavirus recovery fund.Several northern European nations are unhappy about the EU commission plan because it involves collectively raising €500bn as grants for countries worst hit by the pandemic, notably Italy and Spain.A group known as the “frugal four” – Sweden, Denmark, Austria and the Netherlands – have made clear their continued opposition to grants, rather than loans. There are also isions over the proposed €1.1tn EU budget.The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, are backing the commission’s plan. More on that here:The UK’s chief medical officers have agreed that the Covid-19 threat level should be lowered one notch to “epidemic is in general circulation” from “transmission is high or rising exponentially”.The joint biosecurity centre recommended the Covid-19 alert level should move from level 4 (a Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation transmission is high or rising exponentially) to level 3 (a Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation).In a statement the chief medical officers of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland said:There has been a steady decrease in cases we have seen in all four nations, and this continues.It does not mean that the pandemic is over. The virus is still in general circulation, and localised outbreaks are likely to occur.Reacting to the UK CMOs’ decision to lower the UK’s alert level from level 4 to level 3 , the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: The UK moving to a lower alert level is a big moment for the country, and a real testament to the British people’s determination to beat this virus.The government’s plan is working. Infection rates are rapidly falling, we have protected the NHS and, thanks to the hard work of millions in our health and social care services, we are getting the country back on her feet."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4282724.1592515063!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hairdressers and barbers to reopen at end of the month","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA hairdresser at work   in New Delhi, India.

Ministers are also expected to discuss the earlier reopening of salons and beauticians.At a briefing following the meeting of NPHET, Prof Philip Nolan, chair of its Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group, said that Covid-19 was at a very low level in the State and very stable. However, a resurgence in the number of new Covid-19 infections in the State as a result of foreign travel, including from Britain and Sweden, has raised concerns among public health officials.Fewer than 10 new cases of the coronavirus disease relating to travel outside the country were reported over the past fortnight after several weeks with no confirmed cases associated with travel.“Over the last two weeks we have begun to see a small number of travel-related cases - it is a cause for concern nonetheless,” said Prof Nolan. Many of these cases were still being investigated, he added. The Department of Health reported four additional Covid-19 fatalities and 16 new confirmed cases on Thursday, bringing the death toll to 1,714 and the total number of cases to 23,355.Nursing homes account for 962 deaths or 56 per cent of all fatalities from the disease. Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the greater the progress made on suppressing the virus at home, the more important the risk of importing cases from abroad would become.“We wouldn’t like to see any cases being imported if we can avoid that,” he said and advised people to continue to avoid all non-essential and holiday travel to and from Ireland. Dr Holohan said the team did not see pubs reopening in the same phase as restaurants from the end of the month but that if pubs planned to operate as restaurants from this date he hoped publicans would be “responsible” in applying public health advice and guidance “in good faith”.Prof Nolan said that the figures on the low number of new cases and admissions to hospitals and intensive care units showed that the disease was “at a very low level and very stable.”But he sounded “a note of caution” that health officials “would only just now” be seeing the effect of changes made in the second reopening phase on June 8th. PrematureMeanwhile, public health expert Dr Joe Barry warned on Friday that the reopening of pubs is “a little bit premature”.On the balance of risks, the easing of restrictions should be taken “a little more gently” with high risk locations like pubs, he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland.Dr Barry, who is Clinical Professor in Public Health Medicine and Head of the Department of Public Health and Primary Care in Trinity College, Dublin said the issue was that a person could walk into a pub, have a few pints and walk out with Covid-19, but be asymptomatic.“It’s a little bit premature to let pubs reopen the way they want to do it. This has to be looked at much more carefully over the next three weeks,” he said.Dr Barry said pub is a different environment from restaurants, and would be more difficult to control. Pubs are the ideal place for the spread of the virus given the close proximity of customers, he said. Adding alcohol to the situation meant that people’s judgement could “go a little bit.”He argued that the Fáilte Ireland guidelines on the reopening of pubs were “strange” with “a lot of wooly language.”Dr Barry said he could understand publicans intensely lobbying to reopen their businesses, but publicans were not unique in their suffering. The situation was too serious for people to think they could just out to pubs again. After all the efforts that had been made, there was too much to lose, he warned.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Tattoo parlours and tanning salons can also reopen from June 29thScale of action requires changing direction of the whole economy, says Prof Peter ThorneTwenty fatalities involving Covid-19 in week ending June 12th, total deaths \u0026lsquostand at 802\u0026rsquoLane Dempsey (28) left his former partner with lasting brain damage following the attackNew figures from CSO show social media use and streaming services increased in MarchCatherine Martin says infrastructure plans already agreed would go aheadGreens will review implementation of policies every few months, deputy leader saysSligo and Waterford have reported fewer than 10 new cases for seven weeks in a rowLouise Richardson references \u0026lsquoVoldemort\u0026rsquo figure in opposing removal of Cecil Rhodes statue at collegeVictim tells court she feels she has failed as a mother \u0026lsquofor being in such a dark place\u0026rsquoGarda ask people not to breach Covid-19 but express sympathy locally or onlineDay out to Lough Keel on Thursday afternoon ends in tragedyJoan Lucey says she is following health advice in order to protect her staff, customersAccused said reason for attack was \u0026euro300 owed to him by 17-year-oldLikely areas of inquiry include training and equipment, including firearms holstersDeal would see Fianna F\u0026aacuteil and Fine Gael get eight roles each with four going to GreensSuspect has history of mental health issues and drug and alcohol abuseThree prospective coalition parties plan to create posts for 20 junior ministersFormer presidential adviser says in tell-all book Brexit was \u0026lsquocritically important\u0026rsquo to USKilling of detective garda was \u0026lsquoa random act\u0026rsquo, says Drew HarrisStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4283177.1592550408!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus bookshop owner defends facemask policy amid online backlash","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA Cork bookshop owner has defended her decision to ask customers to wear masks coming into her shop to protect against Covid-19 following a backlash on social media. Photograph: Daragh Mc SweeneyProvisionA Cork bookshop owner has defended her decision to ask customers to wear masks coming into her shop to protect against Covid-19 following backlash on social media.Joan Lucey, who owns Vibes and Scribes on Lavitt’s Quay in Cork city centre, re-opened her shop on Tuesday and asked customers to wear a mask and, if they didn’t have one with them, the shop was happy to provide one.“We asked people to wear masks for the safety of our staff and our customers and if they didn’t have one, we were happy to provide them with one and they could make a donation to the Cork Sexual Violence Centre, ” said Ms Lucey.“But we were very surprised when we discovered this really bad reaction on line with some people going on to our Facebook page, accusing us of trying to humiliate them and others saying that they were going to blacklist us.”Another person expressed delight that Vibes and Scribes was after re-opening but said they would “not step a foot inside unless you remove the absurd requirement for people to wear masks”.“Happy to see you have been ‘allowed’ to reopen but very disappointed to see your mask policy! Big NO to masks!! Not necessary, not mandatory! Won’t be visiting your store or any store that has a mask policy,” said another.Another posted a message stating, “Great way to stop customers coming to your shop – nobody should be made to wear face masks, we all have free choice “ while another vowed not to visit “under these humiliating conditions.”OppositionIt appears some of those expressing strong opposition to Vibes and Scribes policy have links to the anti-vaccinations but Ms Lucey said she was simply following HSE advice on masks out of concern for her staff and customers.“We’re asking people to wear masks simply to protect our staff and customers and if for whatever reason, people refuse to wear a mask, we ask them to limit their visit to 10 minutes - again out of concern for our staff and customers.”Ms Lucey, who won Cork Retailer of the Year in 2015, said she was gratified by the many messages of support they had received online from people saying they will come into her shop as Covid 19 has had a devastating impact on retail.“Retail is on its knees. We’ve re-opened our bookshop and no matter what happens when we open up our craft supplies shop on Bridge Street, no matter how the customers feel towards us, it’s going to be very difficult.She said that she had moved all her staff to working on her online craft supplies business and nobody was left go from the Vibes and Scribes team during the pandemic but re-opening her shops presented new challenges.“Funnily enough, in our online shop we’ve been selling huge amounts of products for mask making because we sell a lot of elastics and fabrics, so I was aware that people are making masks and people were pro-masks.”“I admit we didn’t consult with anybody but to be honest I didn’t feel that it was terribly relevant, I thought I was doing the right thing for my staff and my customers and to be fair, most our customers have been supportive.”Official adviceThe latest official advice from the HSE, updated on June 15th, states that face coverings should be worn in situations where it is difficult to practice social distancing, such as in shops and on public transport.“Face coverings help to prevent people who do not know they have the virus from spreading it to others .... it may help to reduce the spread of respiratory droplets from people infected with coronavirus,” said the HSE.Just two days ago, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar launched a government campaign to urge people to wear face masks in public places and he did not rule out the possibility that the government might make the wearing of masks mandatory.“It’s seen as an additional hygiene measure that can help reduce the spread of the infection .... I do see people using them more and more so I think the message is getting across,” he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4283330.1592563089!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cromwell statue at westminister should stay says irish vice chancellor of oxford","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe  statue of Oliver Cromwell at the Houses of Parliament in London. Photograph: EPANEIL HALLOxford’s vice-chancellor has invoked the name of Oliver Cromwell in an attempt to retain the controversial Cecil Rhodes statue at the college. Prof Louise Richardson – who is originally from Tramore, Co Waterford – said memorials were part of our understanding of history. Campaigners have sought for years to remove the statue of Cecil Rhodes from outside Oriel College. Rhodes was an imperialist and diamond magnate based in modern-day South Africa who left a huge amount of money to Oxford in his will. Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, was named after him. Responding to the Rhodes Must Fall campaign, Prof Richardson told the Daily : “The question is, how do we judge people? How do you judge Cecil Rhodes? Do we judge him by our values today or do we judge him by the context of his time?“This is the stuff of academia. This is the stuff of universities. This is what education is all about. I don’t think we can pretend our history is different from what it was.”However, Prof Richardson’s attempts to invoke the name of Nelson Mandela in the statue row has angered many of the university’s academics. Asked whether Mandela would have opposed the Rhodes Must Fall campaign, Prof Richardson said: “I think he was a man of deep nuance who recognised complex problems for what they were. And I don’t think he sought simplistic solutions to complex problems.” In a response published in the Daily , the academics accused Prof Richardson of “inappropriate ventriloquising” of the late South African leader. “It is especially so now, when universities need to listen to, not presume to speak for, black students and people of colour.“Secondly, she claims that the campaign amounts to ’hiding our history’. The opposite is true. What is being demanded is a full and frank accounting for Britain’s history, in place of the selective commemoration of ’great men’ whose wealth was made through white supremacy.” Prof Richardson’s intervention has not stopped the governing body of Oriel College voting to remove the statue of Cecil Rhodes. The college said it had “expressed their wish to remove the statue of Cecil Rhodes and the King Edward Street Plaque”. It will need the permission of the city authorities to do so. British prime minister Boris Johnson has indicated the statue of Cromwell at the Palaces of Westminster will not be removed. In a post on his Facebook page, Mr Johnson said statues were a reminder of the nuances of history and that we should not judge historical characters by contemporary standards. “Where will it end? Are we supposed to haul down Cromwell who killed so many thousands of people in Ireland?”The town of Cromwell in New Zealand is also engaged in a debate over its name. Cromwell resident Ben Deegan, who has Irish roots, told local media that places like Cromwell should be renamed.‘’The name itself is a monument to someone responsible for thousands of deaths, with no bearing on anything here in New Zealand. We are all living on indigenous land, and we should both embrace and respect that.”New Zealand, which removed the statue of Sir John Hamilton from the centre of the town named after him, is engaged in part of a worldwide debate about the removal of colonial-era statues and the renaming of towns and cities.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA Regulations requiring people entering the Republic from abroad to provide the address where they will be self-isolating for the required 14-day period have been extended for a further three weeks. Upon arrival in the State at airports or ports, iniduals are required to fill in a passenger locator form. The coronavirus measures are in place to allow authorities to check if iniduals are self-isolating for 14 days as advised, and for contact tracing purposes. Those who do not fill out the passenger locator form or who provide false details can face a fine of €2,500 or a prison term of six months.The regulations were introduced on May 28th to last until June 18th, at which point they would be reviewed. A Department of Health spokeswoman confirmed on Thursday the regulations had been extended until July 9th, “at which stage they will be reviewed.”“This means anyone arriving in Ireland will have to fill out a form and inform us of their whereabouts. This ensures we have an adequate contact tracing system in place,” she said. The spokeswoman said public health advice instructing people to self-isolate for 14 days upon arriving into the State from abroad remains in place. However, she added this advice was “strongly recommended,” but not mandatory. “We would ask that all persons arriving into the State follow this advice as closely as they can,” she said. In recent weeks the Cabinet has discussed the potential easing of overseas travel restrictions, with the option of permitted travel between other countries where coronavirus has been controlled under consideration. One source said Cabinet colleagues had begun to receive queries from constituents on when they could travel abroad on holidays again.Insurance claimsCurrently the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) advises “against all non-essential travel overseas until further notice,” including Britain, but not Northern Ireland. Several insurance companies have warned if holidaymakers decide to disregard the existing advice on overseas travel they will not be covered. Zurich has advised customers that if iniduals travel abroad against the DFA advice any insurance claim arising from the coronavirus pandemic could be denied. Similarly Laya states if policyholders booked trips after the advice on non-essential travel was introduced they will not be covered.In a statement, Insurance Ireland, which represents the industry, said while the wording of policies differ, “in general if a policy holder decides to travel at a time when the Government advises against non-essential travel, they would be in danger of invalidating their travel insurance.” The group said its “strong advice” is that policyholders “follow the Irish Government’s advice at all times.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4283449.1592572628!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"increase in over 60s using streaming services during lockdown","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe number of older people watching online streaming services such as Netflix and the RTÉ Player increased markedly during the lockdown in March, according to new figures from the CSO.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin has said that when the Taoiseach changes there will be an opportunity to renegotiate the terms of the programme for government. In the meantime the Green Party will conduct internal analysis every two to three months to monitor how policies are being implemented, she told RTÉ radio’s Today with Sarah McInerney show.Ms Martin also reiterated her concern that there are a number of Independent TDs who “have a different ethos” and are in conflict with the Green Party’s principles. No one should have preferential access to Ministers, she said.If a single TD seeks information they should have equal access to members of the Cabinet, she added.Ms Martin refused to discuss leadership of the Green Party, she said that was a matter for after a decision was made on the Programme for Government.DefendThe Dublin-Rathdown representative defended her decision to support the document, she said she believed it was better to be within government where there was the potential to make change. “The country needs stability. There is great uncertainty for us as a nation and as a planet.”The Green Party will continue to “fight hard” and she said they would continue to bring the fight to government, to continue to challenge at all times.Ms Martin talked about her husband Francis Noel Duffy’s different position, she joked it was “interesting times in our house”, but that it was all part of healthy debate. “We agreed to disagree”. It was presumptuous to think that two TDs in same party would think the same way just because they were married, she added. Their discussions were vibrant, she said. They were united as a family and would act in the best interests of the party.No matter what the result of the party’s vote on going into government, everyone would respect the result, she said.“We will go into this government with eyes wide open, if we go into government.”AnalysisShe said there will be internal analysis within the party every two to three months to see if policies are being implemented.If the Green Party was going to go into government it was with the aim of making a substantial change, “there’s no point otherwise.”Ms Martin urged party members to read the programme for government carefully, to take the time to go through the details, but ultimately members must do what they thought was best for the party and the country."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Investigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoTensions remain high despite two governments agreeing to de-escalate confrontationAustralia says it will not name country responsibleKim Yo-jong\u0026rsquos criticism of Seoul illustrates her seniority and potential to become rulerBatons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedNZ officials tracing 320 people regarded as \u0026lsquoclose contacts\u0026rsquo of pair who returned from UKClash on Himalayan border is the most serious since 1967, why now and what next?Any moves to invalidate peace deals posemajor setback to Moon\u0026rsquos efforts for more lasting reconciliation with NorthFirst loss of life in area for decades as \u0026lsquoviolent face-off\u0026rsquo between troops elevates disputeLatest in a series of threats from the Kim regime since diplomacy with US broke downFierce criticism as editor of influential Rappler website faces up to six years in jailChile replaces health minister as deaths spiral while global cases exceed 7.6 millionSocial media giant says China ran network of accounts to spread misinformationTwo years after Trump-Kim summit minister says peace hopes are now \u0026lsquodark nightmare\u0026rsquoThere had been repeated calls by the Maori community to remove statue of John HamiltonLam warns city cannot afford further \u0026lsquochaos\u0026rsquoalmost 9,000 aged 11- 84 arrested in protests over past yearDecision marks a setback in relations amid efforts to persuade North to give up nuclear weapons programmeSouth Pacific nation of 5m declared it was coronavirus free on MondayHospitals feel the strain as lockdowns are eased despite fears of a spike in infectionsHolidaymaker said he stumbled into abandoned well after being chased by wild dogStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"World community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4283390.1592568744!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish america must remain in step with political realities on island of ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Féin at the time, walking in a St Patrick’s Day parade in New York. Photograph: James LeynseCorbis via Getty ImagesAs Brexit threatens to raise its head again as negotiations intensify between British and EU officials, the impact on Northern Ireland will be keenly watched in the US.Senior figures on Capitol Hill and in Irish-America are keeping a close eye on Brexit negotiations, and in particular any attempt by Britain to row back on commitments to preserve an open border on the island of Ireland. Any move to jeopardise the Border arrangements prescribed by the Good Friday Agreement could see Irish-Americans in Congress veto a UK-US trade deal currently under negotiation.New research published in the Journal of American Ethnic History sheds a light on the role played by Irish-America during a previous period in Northern Irish history.The previously unpublished documents uncovered by Ted Smyth, chairman of the UCD Clinton Institute, include a confidential report from the Irish embassy in Washington during the 1980s, a decade that was critical to the emergence of peace in the North.The report on Irish-American organisations was commissioned in 1980 by the Irish ambassador to the US Seán Donlon. With violence at a height in the North, its aim was to outline ways to channel Irish-American concern and anger away from support for the IRA towards a peaceful solution. There was already a growing awareness of the potential of the Irish-American lobby to influence the British government, helped by the formation of a powerful coalition of Irish-Americans at the top of American political life including House speaker Tip O’Neill, senators Ted Kennedy and Patrick Moynihan, and New York governor Hugh Carey. The embassy report reveals a major effort to influence Irish-America through the hundreds of Irish-American organisations dotted throughout the country. Irish officials attended parades, GAA matches, pubs and functions, delivering the message of the Irish government – that Irish unity should be achieved by peaceful means and not through fundraising for Noraid, the hardline organisation which openly supported the IRA. Engagement with US media was also a central strand of the strategy. Shifting directionBy the mid-80s, Sinn Féin was embarking on its own effort to persuade the Irish-American community that Republican politics was shifting direction and moving towards finding a political solution to the conflict. The second unpublished report documented by Smyth is a report on Irish-America commissioned by Gerry Adams and compiled by Declan Kearney and Oistin MacBride.As Smyth details, the 180-page report contained scathing criticisms of Noraid. Sinn Féin was undoubtedly aware that Noraid was losing legitimacy in the US, underscored by the cool response by the US and Irish government establishment to the selection of Noraid leader Michael Flannery as the New York St Patrick’s Day parade grand marshal in 1983. The US department of justice had also registered the group – which had an estimated 5,000 members, according to one study – as an agent of the Provisional IRA in 1981.In December 1988, Adams, armed with the report, had a meeting with the Noraid national executive in Dublin, and told it the organisation would have to align with more “progressive” movements in the US. While many in Noraid saw this as a betrayal, Adams successfully sidelined the hardliners in the organisation, and the separate Friends of Irish Freedom group was formed. Ultimately, Noraid was brought into line and supported the 1994 IRA ceasefire and the Good Friday Agreement. \u0026nbspThose efforts to ensure Northern Ireland’s most influential supporters were on board ahead of the seismic events of the 1990s are an interesting reminder of the role played by Irish-America at a crucial stage in the peace process. Twenty-two years later, the threat posed by Brexit has reawakened interest in the issue. Diaspora Sinn Féin, newly resurgent in the Republic after its very strong performance in February’s election, is acutely aware of the continuing power of Irish-America. Adams, the former Sinn Féin president, took part in a virtual Irish Unity conference earlier this month, where he urged the diaspora to support a referendum on Irish unity.The public expressions of solidarity with former INLA prisoner Malachy McAllister, who was deported to Ireland this month, from senior US figures is an indication of the support former participants in the armed struggle still command in the US.As Northern Ireland looks ahead to the next stage in its history, ensuring that Irish-America remains in step with the views and political realities on the island of Ireland is essential if the US is to contribute constructively to the debate on Irish unity.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this.

The composer hopes that a one-off performance of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat will go ahead at the London Palladium in July, explaining: “We’ve just had the final bits of equipment delivered into England, we hope to have them in the theatres next month.“All one can do is try and be positive. I really believe that we in theatre must be positive and use everything we can to demonstrate that we can open. If having done that we fail, at least we’ve tried.”The coronavirus has had a devastating impact on the British theatre industry, with producer Cameron Mackintosh announcing this week that Phantom, Hamilton, Les Misérables and Mary Poppins would not be opening their doors again until 2021, with redundancies expected for employees on all four shows.A report from industry leaders also published this week warned that the UK is facing a “cultural catastrophe” and the loss of £74bn and more than 400,000 jobs this year as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.The Phantom of the Opera\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Uddin is one of a number of suppliers who say that Sir Philip’s fashion empire has refused to pay for millions of pounds worth of orders, leaving them struggling to pay workers and keep the lights on.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Uddin told The Independent that he was forced to shut down production two weeks ago because cancelled orders meant his cash flow had dried up and he could not pay money owed to suppliers of materials. He said he is now paying out $25,000 per day in costs but has no income, and now fears that without an urgent resolution he will have to close his doors for good.The Bangladesh Export Processing Zone, where Denim Expert’s factory is located, has suspended Mr Uddin’s import and export permissions because of unpaid rent and utility bills. Goods that were due to be shipped out in February and March have been sat in containers at the port incurring charges each day.“With payments virtually suspended since the outbreak started, there has been a catastrophic impact upon the cash flow of our operation, which functions on very low margins at the best of times,” Mr Uddin said.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailAccording to campaign group Traidcraft, around 70 per cent of the cost of the garments is for the raw materials that go into them. Most manufacturers take this material on credit and pay it off when buyers pay them for the finished goods, meaning that when money is not forthcoming they quickly run into problems. Arcadia said it had no direct relationship with Denim Expert but confirmed that it did have outstanding orders for the company’s goods via a third party which buys jeans from a number of factories.Following media coverage of Mr Uddin’s problems with Arcadia and other buyers, an Arcadia representative contacted Denim Expert but no agreement has been reached. The company offered to buy some of the goods but not until August, an offer which Mr Uddin said he could not accept. An Arcadia spokesperson said the group was “in ongoing discussions” with its suppliers, including Denim Expert, to come to an agreement about the cancelled orders. The group has been in financial difficulty in recent years, narrowly avoiding administration in June 2019 after landlords backed a rescue deal at the last minute. Under the deal, 50 stores were earmarked for closure and 1,000 people lost their jobs. Former Debenhams employees raise money for Bangladeshi workersWhy coronavirus could add fuel to fast fashion’s fireRenting could be the trick to help me curb my fast fashion habitsLike the rest of the fashion retail sector, Arcadia has also been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown, which forced all non-essential stores to close on the 23 March.Mr Uddin is one of hundreds of suppliers to the fashion industry facing imminent closure after months of unpaid orders.While some buyers, including H\u0026ampM and Zara, have honoured the majority of contracts and paid for orders, others such as Asda, Arcadia and Edinburgh Woollen Mill have demanded steep discounts or failed to pay for goods altogether.According to data published in April by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), the Arcadia Group cancelled £9m worth of orders in Bangladesh alone.Usually in manufacturing industries like this, whatever the buyer wants, you have to accept. That’s how it’s been for the last 100 yearsGlobally, the group, which is owned by Sir Philip’s wife through a holding company in Monaco, cancelled as much as £100m, according to The Worker Rights Consortium (WRC).Mr Uddin added: “I am not interested to work with Arcadia any more. I want to get rid of them as a buyer. Usually in manufacturing industries like this, whatever the buyer wants, you have to accept. That’s how it’s been for the last 100 years.“I have made up my mind. I only want to work with the people who are fair and responsible.”Fiona Gooch, senior policy advisor at Traidcraft Exchange, said: “It is terrible that factories are having to close in Bangladesh, and other garment producing countries, through no fault of their own. “By refusing to pay up, brands like Philip Green’s Burton Menswear are putting thousands of workers, mainly young women and their families at risk of destitution. “Philip Green is a millionaire. Like other fashion brand owners, he can easily afford to pay for the finished clothes that they have previously ordered, and the fabric bought to make future orders for them.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But the bank’s purchasing programme provides some useful insurance against itAs the saying goes: “A billion here, a billion there – soon you’re talking serious money.”How about hundreds of billions?The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee has voted to increase its asset purchase scheme by another £100bn. This comes on top of the £200bn it committed to purchasing earlier in the year.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhat does that mean?The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government’s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?The first thing to note is that the bank will now be purchasing £300bn of UK government bonds in 2020.That’s roughly equivalent to the projected deficit of the UK government in the current financial year to pay for all its emergency coronavirus-related spending, including the jobs furlough scheme.It’s not quite correct to say that the bank is funding the state’s spiralling deficit during this crisis.The projected public-sector net cash requirement is actually more than £400bn and private investors will have to buy the debt first and then sell to the bank.Yet it’s abundantly clear to everyone in the financial markets that the bank is acting as an effective backstop for government’s borrowing.Does that matter?It certainly matters for UK government bond investors.They know they can be confident that when they buy UK government bonds – known as gilts – from the Debt Management Office they will be able to sell them on to the bank.That removes any fear that they will be stuck holding bonds that no one else wants to buy.This should stabilise the market for UK government debt, meaning that it can continue to borrow to support millions of ordinary British workers and businesses.It’s far from clear that there was any danger of a crisis in the UK government bond market. But the bank’s purchasing programme provides some useful insurance against it.Will it help the economy directly? The bank says the asset purchases should help support demand – or spending – in the economy. The evidence here is somewhat mixed. It’s plausible that purchases helped do that in the immediate wake of the financial crisis. But the power of successive rounds of asset purchases to support demand directly seemed to weaken.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In part that’s because previous warnings of an inflationary spiral proved unwarranted.It’s also because the Bank is no outlier it’s doing pretty much the same as other big central banks such as the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. The Fed has effectively promised unlimited bond purchases in this crisis.£100bn is serious money in anyone’s book. But the reality is that, in the world of central banking in the era of Covid-19, it’s nothing particularly special.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“As partial lifting of the measures takes place, we see signs of some activity returning,” said Mr Bailey in the press conference.But he added: “We don’t want to get too carried away by this. Let’s be clear, we’re still living in very unusual times.The minutes of the MPC’s meeting warned: “While recent demand and output data had not been quite as negative as expected, other indicators suggested greater risks around the potential for longer lasting damage to the economy from the pandemic.”Voting against further stimulus measures, Mr Haldane said that the recovery was happening “sooner and materially faster” than had been forecast in May.Data on payments suggest consumer spending started to recover in May and June, and the housing market has recently begun to pick up, the bank said.Official figures released last week show that gross domestic product (GDP) slumped by a record 20.4 per cent in April as the country endured a full month of lockdown conditions, and has now contracted by a quarter since the Covid-19 outbreak began.The UK economy is forecast to be hit harder than that of any other developed nation.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said last month that UK output will shrink 11.5 per cent this year or 14 per cent if there is a second wave of coronavirus cases.The extra £100bn stimulus announced on Thursday will be used to buy gilts – UK government debt – with purchases to be completed by the end of 2020.Government spending has soared to cover the cost of schemes to support businesses and jobs. Public sector borrowing is expected to surpass £300bn this year.The bank says the asset purchases should help support demand – or spending – in the economy, which has fallen dramatically during the pandemic.There had been some speculation that the bank might cut its key benchmark interest rate to below zero for the first time.But there was no discussion of this in the MPC minutes.At the press conference Mr Bailey said that it remained an option but stressed there was no reason to expect it to be introduced imminently.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Online sales surged from 30.8 per cent of all retail sales in April to 33.4 per cent in May.

Retailers are reliant on a continued improvement in sales after thousands of non-essential shops across the country began to reopen this week. With numbers of customers strictly limited, queues formed outside some stores on Monday.A number of big retailers are opening stores in phases as they assess the effectiveness of safety measures, as well as the profitability of different sites in a socially distanced environment.Concerns remain that relaxing restrictions will lead to a rise in infections, forcing shops to close again. That scenario could prove disastrous for high street retailers, many of which are already facing difficult financial circumstances.Tom Leman, head of retail at law firm Pinsent Masons, said: “It’s been a big week for retailers with the reopening of many stores across the country and reports of long queues as consumers eagerly return to physical shops. “However, today’s figures are a clear reminder of the challenges facing the sector as they look to make up on the financial impact of store closure. It is crucial that, as retailers strive to regain lost revenue, they balance the health and safety of consumers alongside a great retail experience.”Office for National Statistics\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“As partial lifting of the measures takes place, we see signs of some activity returning,” said Mr Bailey in the press conference.But he added: “We don’t want to get too carried away by this. Let’s be clear, we’re still living in very unusual times.The minutes of the MPC’s meeting warned: “While recent demand and output data had not been quite as negative as expected, other indicators suggested greater risks around the potential for longer lasting damage to the economy from the pandemic.”Voting against further stimulus measures, Mr Haldane said that the recovery was happening “sooner and materially faster” than had been forecast in May.Data on payments suggest consumer spending started to recover in May and June, and the housing market has recently begun to pick up, the bank said.Official figures released last week show that gross domestic product (GDP) slumped by a record 20.4 per cent in April as the country endured a full month of lockdown conditions, and has now contracted by a quarter since the Covid-19 outbreak began.The UK economy is forecast to be hit harder than that of any other developed nation.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said last month that UK output will shrink 11.5 per cent this year or 14 per cent if there is a second wave of coronavirus cases.The extra £100bn stimulus announced on Thursday will be used to buy gilts – UK government debt – with purchases to be completed by the end of 2020.Government spending has soared to cover the cost of schemes to support businesses and jobs. Public sector borrowing is expected to surpass £300bn this year.The bank says the asset purchases should help support demand – or spending – in the economy, which has fallen dramatically during the pandemic.There had been some speculation that the bank might cut its key benchmark interest rate to below zero for the first time.But there was no discussion of this in the MPC minutes.At the press conference Mr Bailey said that it remained an option but stressed there was no reason to expect it to be introduced imminently.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For those that can’t figure out the puzzles for themselves, all 15 combinations are listed at the bottom of the article.Inevitably, spoilers for the game follow...In the game’s opening chapter, this safe is found in the supermarket in Jackson. The clue is found on the desk next to the safe. Look behind you, and you will see a wall with pictures of “Employees of the Month” – there should be one that stands out.In Seattle, Day 1, you have the option of exploring the Bank with Ellie in the Downtown area (located at 5th and James). You can find a note detailing the plans for a failed bank heist, which also provides the combination for the safe room. Travel through the safety deposit box room  – found at the end of the tills – and the vault should be on your left.What does The Last of Us Part II’s LGBT representation mean for games?Ellie finds this easily missable safe after going through the fence Downtown at Madison between 5th and 6th during Seattle Day 1. The combination is the same as the code used to open West Gate 2 – so check the list of gate codes that should be in your inventory.The fourth safe is found in the courthouse in Seattle Day 1. It’s located under a desk by the window before you travel into the car park. The skeletal remains of a FEDRA soldier are nearby. There’s a white board nearby with the combination written on.In the Capitol Hill segment of Seattle Day 1, you encounter this safe around the time you start seeing explosive tripwires, in a thrift shop that’s by a gym. The safe is placed right at the back, and requires solving two clues to open – the first, on the bulliten board, which leads you to the second, which is written on the walls of the thrift shop’s toilets.The final safe in Seattle Day 1 is located in a breakroom in the area where you first fight Shamblers. The clue is written on a note left on a table, which points you towards a can of soda. Smash open a vending machine, and you will find part of the answer. Tap the numbers into the lock, and you will gain access to the employee locker room.At the beginning of Seattle Day 2, you need to find a tattoo parlour, located near the bike shop. Go through the parlour, and there is a small building in the back with a dumpster propped against the door. The safe is inside you can find the combination written on a note in one of the nearby buildings. Beware though – there are infected inside too.The Last of Us Part II is a bleak and beautiful triumph – reviewLater in Seattle Day 2, when you’re en route to the hospital and walking down Route 5, you’ll reach a gate you can’t open, requiring you to use a dumpster to prop up the gate. Before doing so, however, look for a nearby apartment with a truck parked outside that you can climb to enter through the second floor. Once in, you’ll find a note telling you that the safe code corresponds to a wedding anniversary. It’s written on a calendar nearby – count back 30 years from the circled date.This safe is also found during Seattle Day 2. After travelling through the Merci building, you drop into a pool and emerge on the other side of the road. Go into Weston’s pharmacy – the note containing the full code is found on your way in.During Seattle Day 3, Ellie acquires a speedboat. After travelling a short distance, you’ll reach a point where a gate blocks your progress, and you have to leave the boat to open it. There’s a caged area in your immediate proximity containing the safe – climb up to the upper level and search one of the dead bodies for a note that discloses the combination. Shift the cart away from the wall to reveal a hole, which leads you into the cage.During Abby’s Seattle Day 1, you pass by a hardware store. After going through it and the boat repair shop, you come across a trailer. Break a window, go inside, and there’s a WLF gun cache note with the combination on it. The safe itself is then stored in a nearby building, which you can enter through a hole in the wall, around the left side.In Abby’s section of the game, you come across a row of shops, including a bakery and the Red Dragon Bar, and what looks like an antiques shop. Travel through the bar up to the second floor, and jump across into the opposite building. There’s a note on the second floor that tells you the combination to the safe – which is kept in the bakery opposite.Naughty Dog boss says The Last of Us Part 3 could be next projectThe final safe in Abby’s Seattle Day 1 is found on the crashed ship, at the back of the boat. The combination clue is written on the mutiny note.After climbing the rapids and crossing the highway overpass in Abby’s Day 2, you jump down into an apartment, which contains the safe and notes left between two of the building’s neighbours. Look at the apartment numbers on the doors in the hallway to determine the combination, as per the note’s instructions.The last safe is located in the skyscraper in Abby’s Seattle Day 2, which you must travel down on your way to the hospital. Search the storage room next to the gym entrance, before the spore-filled area. A clue for the combination is written on an artefact inside the back room – the code is the same as the Wi-fi password, which is written near the juice bar.All the combinations:The Last of Us Part 2\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Online sales surged from 30.8 per cent of all retail sales in April to 33.4 per cent in May. Online-only retailers grew 24.3 per cent in the three months to May.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?In a further sign that economic activity began to recover in May, fuel sales rose but remain 42.5 per cent down on February.Food store sales dipped 0.3 per cent in May but remained high after a spike in April caused by restaurants, caterers, schools and food-to-go shops closing down. Retailers are reliant on a continued improvement in sales after thousands of non-essential shops across the country began to reopen this week. With numbers of customers strictly limited, queues formed outside some stores on Monday.A number of big retailers are opening stores in phases as they assess the effectiveness of safety measures, as well as the profitability of different sites in a socially distanced environment.Concerns remain that relaxing restrictions will lead to a rise in infections, forcing shops to close again. That scenario could prove disastrous for high street retailers, many of which are already facing difficult financial circumstances.Tom Leman, head of retail at law firm Pinsent Masons, said: “It’s been a big week for retailers with the reopening of many stores across the country and reports of long queues as consumers eagerly return to physical shops. “However, today’s figures are a clear reminder of the challenges facing the sector as they look to make up on the financial impact of store closure. It is crucial that, as retailers strive to regain lost revenue, they balance the health and safety of consumers alongside a great retail experience.”Office for National Statistics\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Currently, it is only available to iOS users, but is expected to eventually come to Android users too.Tapping the button to compose a tweet will shows a new button with a wavelength icon. Hitting it pops up a record button, which will capture 140 seconds of audio.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, many users pointed out that these kind of tweets could not be accessed by deaf people.Other social platforms, including YouTube, Zoom, Snapchat, and Facebook videos all have captioning.Journalist Liam O’Dell tweeted: “It\u0027s one thing getting Twitter users to caption their videos, asking them to caption audio tweets just makes the social media platform even more inaccessible to #deaf people like me.”Some users suggested providing subtitles, or alternative text, so that it could be more accessible.In a thread, the company apologised for treating accessibility as an “afterthought”.Instagram to overtake Twitter for news, report finds“We\u0027re sorry about testing voice Tweets without support for people who are visually impaired, deaf, or hard of hearing. It was a miss to introduce this experiment without this support” the company said.“We’ve fixed several issues related to vision accessibility, including making voice Tweets identifiable on the timeline and making accessibility improvements to the voice Tweet experience. These updates will be available in a forthcoming iOS release”“We’re already exploring ideas for how we could support manual and auto transcriptions. We’re also looking at how we can build a dedicated group to focus on accessibility, tooling, and advocacy across all products”It was also revealed that Twitter does not have a dedicated accessibility group. The company, which made 3.46 billion dollars in 2019, relies on employees volunteering rather than a formal team, according to Twitter software engineer Andrew Hayward.“The volunteers behind accessibility at Twitter (there is no formal team) strive to do their best to ensure products are shipped appropriately. Unfortunately though, we aren\u0027t aware of every product decision, and the wider #a11y conversation is ongoing.” he tweeted.Twitter’s head of design and research Dantley Davis said that he would advocate for accessability to be a part of project design from the beginning of all projects in future.“I appreciate the feedback and direct conversation about #a11y from our passionate community” It\u0027s clear we have a lot of work ahead to make Twitter more inclusive for people with disabilities.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Feral cats that roamed the farms were also found to to be infected with the coronavirus.Experimental evidence shows that SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, can infect cats, dogs, monkeys, ferrets, and hamsters, said the authors, who added that attention should be paid to rabbits, sheep, goats, cattle and horses as computational studies suggest the potential for infection.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“Once SARS-CoV-2 circulates more widely beyond humans, it will be challenging to trace natural transmission between species because the viral genome is essentially identical in humans, and existing epidemiological are equipped to identify transmission between humans to interrupt it,” they write.The possibility of a new “reservoir species” must also be considered. A “reservoir species” refers to a living host of certain species in which a pathogen survives without always causing disease for the host itself.The authors said: “Domestic species whose population numbers are sufficient to act as a reservoir include cats and dogs, which is consistent with the case reports noted earlier, and studies showing or predicting infectivity.”Farmed wildlife such as mink and pigs, as well as rodents, could also act as a reservoir species as they “have sufficient numbers and densities for continuous transmission”.“These considerations should lead to strategies for implementing early surveillance and precautionary mitigation measures on different species,” the authors concluded.Prof Santini told the PA news agency: “We need to develop surveillance strategies to ensure we don’t get taken by surprise by a large outbreak in animals, which could pose a threat not just to animal health but to human health as well.“Virus transmission in animal populations could become irreversible if left unchecked, and may threaten the success of existing public health measures if people continue to catch the virus from an infected population of animals.”The comment comes after a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, published last month, said cats can readily become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may be able to pass the virus to other cats.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A meat-packing plant in West Yorkshire has been placed under emergency lockdown after a severe outbreak of coronavirus.Mobile testing tents have been set up outside Kober Ltd, near the town of Cleckheaton, after an unspecified number of workers came down with Covid-19.Both Kirklees Council, the local authority, and the government have refused to say if there have been any deaths or hospitalisations associated with the new explosion of cases.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut on Friday, the plant – which is owned by Asda and supplies its stores with bacon and joints – remained shut down.In a statement, the supermarket giant said: As soon as we became aware that some colleagues at our Kober site may have Covid-19, we responded swiftly and worked collaboratively with the local authority and Public Health England to test all colleagues.”Children’s ward closes as staff self-isolate after positive Covid testAround 100 contacts of staff are reported to have been traced and told to isolate.The existence of the outbreak was revealed by health secretary Matt Hancock in an unscripted moment during Thursday’s live Downing Street press conference.Answering a question about how so-called local lockdowns might be implemented, he said: “The system is already up and running. In fact, I chaired a meeting this morning of our local action committee, which is the formal process through which we make these decisions, working with local leaders, for instance, in Kirklees.“And the local director of public health and the council are heavily involved in the response.”But it raised immediate questions about why Kirklees Council itself had apparently sought to keep the outbreak secret.All libraries, museums and galleries in Leeds could closeIn a statement, Rachel Spencer-Henshall, the area\u0027s director of public health, said: “We were made aware of a number of positive cases of Covid-19 at a workplace in Kirklees.“We have been providing support and advice to both the management and employees in order to minimise any further transmission.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All the famous faces, including a picture of Sir Peter, are “fans” of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.Each fragment will be signed by the artist and auctioned on Bidsquare, with bids starting at £325. The auction will be live until midnight on 26 June.The idea originated when London Advertising approached Sir Peter about the project as it wanted to use the mural to raise money for organisations helping people during the pandemic.Sir Peter, who also designed artwork for Paul Weller, Ian Dury and The Who, said: “I’m very happy that the Mandarin Oriental mural can be used a second time to raise money for such a wonderful purpose. I do all kinds of areas of work but one of them is to make crowds of people.Created with Sketch.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them. They are very comfortable to wear.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease. So put simply, if I wear one I protect you, if you wear one you protect me.Patrick Grant is a star of television’s ‘Great British Sewing Bee’The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

He added that it was time for legislative action and not another review.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe UK already has one of the most comprehensive centralised databases related to race and ethnicity in the form of its “Ethnicity facts and figures” service. It is designed to provide information about “the different experiences of people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds” and reveals some startling disparities between white people and Bame people living in the UK.Below are 11 charts that illustrate these different experiences.Stop-and-search powers have been heavily scrutinised in recent years and were the subject of a review by the Equality and Human Rights Commission in 2010 that found that black people were up to six-times more likely to be stopped by police than white people.Stop-and-search rates between 2018 and 2019 show that black people are now nearly 10-times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than white people. This has contributed to far higher arrest rates for black people than for white people.Not a single police force in England or Wales registered an arrest rate of less than 20 for every 1,000 black people.By contrast, not a single police force in England and Wales registered an arrest rate of more than 20 for every 1,000 white people.Disproportionate policing practices were also highlighted in a recent investigation into coronavirus lockdown enforcement across England and Wales.Freedom of Information (FOI) requests by advocacy group Liberty found that police forces were seven times more likely to fine Bame people during lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Around 63 per cent of households in the UK live in homes that they own, according to figures from the English Housing Survey.When these households are broken down into ethnicity, however, a stark difference emerges.White British people have higher than average home ownership rates ⁠— nearly double that of black Caribbean people and more than treble that of black African people. These minorities are instead vastly over represented when it comes to private renting and social housing.Only Indian households, which make up just 2.5 per cent of the population of England and Wales according to the 2011 Census, have higher home ownership rates the white British households.The lack of home ownership among minority communities in the UK may contribute to a reduced feeling of belonging compared to white people.Results from the most recent Community Life Survey found that black people are increasingly less likely to feel as though they belong to Britain compared to white or Asian people.A similar story of inequality can be seen when breaking down education statistics by ethnicity. It emerges as early as primary education, where white British children are 10 per cent more likely to achieve the expected standard in reading, writing and maths.By the time the two groups reach A-levels, white British students are more than three times as likely to achieve high grades than black Caribbean students, according to figures from the Department for Education.Worse education transfers to worse employment rates for minorities, with black people seeing at least double the unemployment levels as white people between 2004 and 2018.The UK’s Annual Population Survey revealed that black people in employment are also paid less on average than white people.Average hourly pay for black people hovered between £9.91 and £10.80 between 2013 and 2018, while white people saw wages consistently rise from £10.58 to £11.87. Only people from Indian backgrounds received better pay than white people.Systemic racism in the UK even manifests itself in the proportion of deaths from the coronavirus pandemic.Data reveals that people from Bame backgrounds are up to twice as likely to die from Covid-19 than people of whit British ethnicity.The risk of death for people of Bangladeshi ethnicity is twice as high as white British, while other Asian, black and Caribbean ethnicities are between 10 per cent and 50 per cent more likely to die, according to a report from Public Health England.Health experts say there is no evidence to suggest that people from Bame backgrounds are genetically predisposed to be more vulnerable to the virus than white people. The figures are therefore a result of existing social and racial inequalities.In his attack on the government’s plans for a racial equality commission, Lammy said the time for holding discussions and launching reviews was over.Nine charts that show extent of racial inequality in US“It feels that yet again in the UK we want figures, data, but we don’t want action,” he said.“Black people aren’t playing victim, as Boris indicated, they are protesting precisely because the time for review is over, and the time for action is now ... Get on with the action, legislate, move.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The official UK coronavirus alert level has been cut from 4 to 3, signalling that transmission of the disease is no longer regarded as high.Health secretary Matt Hancock hailed the move as a big moment for the country and praised the contribution of the public in getting the virus under control by complying with lockdown rules.The green-light for the change came from the expert Joint Biosecurity Centre, which recommended a reduction in the level. It was jointly approved by the chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Hancock said:  “The UK moving to a lower alert level is a big moment for the country, and a real testament to the British people’s determination to beat this virus.“The government’s plan is working. Infection rates are rapidly falling, we have protected the NHS and, thanks to the hard work of millions in our health and social care services, we are getting the country back on her feet.”The change is likely to pave the way for further relaxations of the lockdown restrictions introduced by Boris Johnson in March. It will raise hopes that ministers will soon confirm the reopening of pubs and restaurants and permission for overnight stays in hotels and B\u0026ampBs from 4 July.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?But the chief medical officers warned that it did not mean the pandemic is over. They cautioned that localised outbreaks are likely to occur and urged the public to continue following safety guidelines.The UK has remained at Level 4 of the alert system since its introduction in May, signifying that a Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation and transmission is high or rising exponentially.Level 3 indicates that the epidemic is in general circulation, but crucially makes clear that experts do not regard either the prevalence of the disease as high or its spread as rapid.In a joint statement, the CMOs for the four nations of the UK said they had reviewed the evidence and agreee with the JBC’s recommendation to move to Level 3 across the entire country.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The virus is still in general circulation, and localised outbreaks are likely to occur.“We have made progress against the virus thanks to the efforts of the public and we need the public to continue to follow the guidelines carefully to ensure this progress continues.”When first announced in the government’s coronavirus recovery plan in May, the alert level was presented as the key to easing lockdown restrictions.The plan stated that the timing of measures like the reopening of shops and the return of children to schools “must be warranted by the current alert level”.But in the event, the government went ahead with two waves of relaxation on 1 and 15 June without the JBC assessing that the risk level had fallen.At the time of the first set of adjustments to guidelines, Mr Hancock revealed that the Centre was not even up and running yet. And ministers later suggested that its principal role will be to monitor the disease for early signs of local outbreaks.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In Vietnam, rats are caught in rice fields – some traders breed them in farms with other live animals.For years scientists have warned that the wildlife trade – including wet markets that sell live animals – can harbour infectious diseases such as coronaviruses.The origins of the current Covid-19 pandemic remain contested. However, experts suspect that the disease started in bats and was transferred to another animal before being passed on to humans.The study, published in the bioRxiv journal ahead of peer-review, found six known coronaviruses in samples taken from three southern provinces in Vietnam between 2013 and 2014.New York rats feel the pressure of city livingPositives increased significantly along the supply chain.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiuseppina La Rosa, an expert in environmental wastewater at the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) who co-led the research, said the findings “may help us understand the beginning of virus circulation” in the country. The ISS looked at sewage samples collected from wastewater treatment plants in northern Italy between October 2019 and February 2020.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Traces of coronavirus were discovered on 18 December – before the virus was known to have reached Italy – in samples from Milan and Turin, an analysis released on Thursday said.Small studies conducted by scientific teams in the Netherlands, France, Australia and elsewhere have found signs that the virus causing Covid-19 can be detected in sewage.Many countries are beginning to use wastewater sampling to track the spread of the disease.Ms La Rosa said the detection of traces of the virus before the end of 2019 was consistent with evidence emerging in other countries about when coronavirus had entered their borders. Scientists in France have discovered a hospitalised man was infected with the virus as early as 29 December – nearly a month before France confirmed its first cases.Ms La Rosa said the presence of the virus in the Italian waste samples did not “automatically imply that the main transmission chains that led to the development of the epidemic in our country originated from these very first cases”.Samples positive for traces of the virus that causes Covid-19 were also found in sewage from Bologna, Milan and Turin in January and February, but all from October and November tested negative.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And it couldnt come at a greater time of need: with our nation on the brink of the worst ever holiday hunger.The Covid pandemic has had a devastating financial impact on families up and down the country, with millions now struggling to keep a roof over their heads.Parents are, understandably, racked with anxiety over job losses, loved ones health and school closures, which have seen classrooms lie empty for  weeks.And this week, with the summer holidays looming, they faced another worry: how would they feed their children without free school meal vouchers Its a fear Rashford has bravely alleviated.The Man Utd star made an impassioned plea to the Government to prioritise Englands most vulnerable kids by extending the vouchers scheme over the six-week holidays.Under the programme, the families of around . million children eligible for free school meals are given £ a week in vouchers to spend in supermarkets to keep their kids fed.This is not about politics this is about humanity, Rashford wrote in an open letter. Political affiliations aside, can we not all agree that no child should be going to bed hungry The footballer was speaking from real experience: growing up in a low-income household in Manchester, his own family relied on free school meals and breakfast clubs.Today, a similar hand-to-mouth existence is being lived by millions of children across the country. And, in recent months, its been compounded by the coronavirus outbreak.Despite the Governments excellent furlough scheme, , Brits have lost their jobs during lockdown, with unemployment now set to hit the three million mark.As Rashford rightly observes, many families are living on a knes edge, gripped with fear over how they will pay their bills, cover their rent or even put food on the table.This is proven by new data from The Food Foundation, showing that food insecurity in households with children has nearly DOUBLED since the pandemic began.The research also reveals more than , youngsters have been forced to skip meals during lockdown because their family couldn’t access sufficient food.As Chair of the Commons Education Committee, I was delighted when, earlier this year, the Government extended its free school meals scheme for the Easter and May half-term holidays.Yet, like many, I believed its decision to halt the programme for the summer break was wrong.In my view, this was for three key reasons:Firstly, the vouchers have been a leline for many poverty-stricken families during the Covid lockdown. With further worrying and uncertain weeks ahead, these families need consistency.Secondly, and closely linked, is that millions of parents are struggling financially at the moment - something that may be exacerbated in August, when furlough contributions change.Feeding their kids over the summer will push their already stretched budgets to breaking point. Yet these youngsters desperately need, and deserve, nutritional meals.Thirdly, around three million children are at risk of holiday hunger every year .Extending the scheme was simply the right thing to do.It was also relatively easy: yes, its coming out of a £ million Covid Summer Food Fund, but unlike other schemes, it isnt bureaucratic and its understood by parents across England.It also goes to those who need it the most.Studies have shown that food poverty doesnt just impact on childrens health: malnourished kids are less likely to perform as well in the classroom as their better-off peers.This can shape the course of their adult le.England is already facing an educational Ice Ageschools cant open in September - by which point, children will have been out of education for six months.Despite parents home-schooling efforts,  per cent of teachers in the countrys most deprived areas have suggested their students are learning for less than one hour a day.And some , youngsters don’t have access to a computer or tablet at all.Its why Ive called for Alan Turing catch-up summer camps to be set up in school buildings, village halls and marquees - anywhere that can be used to educate our kids.Its also why, despite being a Tory MP, I publicly announced I would vote with Labour today and call on the Government to extend free school meals over the summer.To use a football analogy, it felt strange going to play for the opposite side. But like Rashford, I knew that impoverished families across the UK deserved more.Fortunately, Boris has seen sense, too.Amid this crisis, we need a bold vision from the PM about our childrens education: what are we going to do to get them learning again  How will we get them back to schools We need an exciting, confident agenda, because the next generation depends on it. With todays move, Boris has shown these families that, yes, we do mean business.As for Rashford, he has done as much -not more - for disadvantaged families than any politician. Hes brought a vital issue onto the national stage in a dignied way.Unlike virtue-signalling celebrities who fly on a plane from Los Angeles then go on about saving the environment, he has practised what he preaches.And in doing so, hes shown himself to be a nation icon on and off the pitch.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, the majority anyway.Be it scientist “Professor Lockdown” flouting his own advice, or Boris’s svengali Dominic Cummings bending the rules he helped make, the rot set in a couple of weeks ago and has now caused an undeniable fissure between the state and its initially compliant citizens.Yet, while thousands are blatantly breaking social distancing rules at parks, protests and shopping areas, many of them are still being furloughed — at vast taxpayer expense — to “stay home” from work.Whereas common sense dictates that being in an office that’s been health and safety-ed to the nth degree is a far more protected environment than any of the above.And what about schools  The majority of learning for GCSEs and A levels takes place in years  and  respectively, yet government plans for the \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"reopening of secondary schools remain “unclear”, with some reports saying they might not evenin September.Meaning that — on top of GCSEs and A levels being cancelled this year — hundreds of thousands of pupils will be in no position to take them next year either.If teenagers can gather in large, cheek-by-jowl groups at their local park, then surely ing to school isn’t beyond the pale  It might even be safer.As for the hospitality industry, well, not only is the two-metre rule killing it but pubs, in particular, face the galling reality of remaining closed while their beer gardens are used by hordes of people who’ve bought booze at the local supermarket.Enough already. Time, surely, for the Government to open its eyes to what’s happening around the country and exercise some common sense.Of course those who are vulnerable should continue to take as many protective measures as they wish, including remaining furloughed or off schoolnecessary.But the majority should nowto work or schooland start to get Britain back on its feet, both economically and psychologically.SCIENTISTS say that intelligent le could exist on as many as  planets in our galaxy.But they reckon aliens won’t visit Earth because of the distance.The two-week quarantine rules won’t help either.HOLLYWOOD actress Sharon Stone has revealed she was struck by lightening while doing the ironing.What a terrible shock.No, not the estimated billion volts that propelled Sharon across the kitchen, silly.The fact that a movie star was doing her own housework.TATLER magazine’s \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"controversial article on The Duchess of Cambridge proved that snobbery is still alive and kicking in certain sections of the British “upper” classes.Dredging up the age-old “doors to manual” jibe at Kate’s mother Carole, a former member of cabin crew, it also resurrected ancient, alleged whisperings among chinless wonders of her being “NQOCD” – not quite our class, darling.This week, Rosalind Mann died, after a -year career taking photos of posh “girls in pearls” for Country Le magazine.When asked the criteria for posing, she replied: “We never featured anyone whose house had a number.”There’s snobbery in the US too, but it’s largely centred around money, rather than class.In the compellingly vacuous Netflix series Selling Sunset, about a high-end estate agency in Hollywood, the buzz phrase is: “Millionaires have views, billionaires have compounds.”Sadly, I have neither.IN the next James Bond movie, No Time To Die, it’s reported that the legendary spy has a young daughter with Lea Seydoux’s character.Could this see those famous blue trunks being replaced by a papoose It’s tricky waters for Bond fans, with  per cent telling a recent poll that they think it’s a mistake to make the famous philanderer a family man.I’ll reserve judgment until the film is released, but suffice to say, tackling villains such as Le Chfre, Blofeld and Raoul Silva is child’s play compared to dealing with a toddler in meltdown.A PUNTER has placed a bet on Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis becoming PM by the end of .A spokesman for bookmaker Coral said: “The bet took us by surprise but someone’s convinced Maitlis could be the perfect match for No!”Presumably they’re not taking bets on which party she’d stand for as that would be too obvious.RICKY Gervais says that wherever he is in the world, he always frequents Italian restaurants because: “I know it’s going to be good and the same.”We have a similar issue at Moore Towers where – whether we’re at a Greek, French, Chinese, Italian or Japanese restaurant – the Bloke will spend aeons studying the ious culinary delights on offer before ordering “steak and chips” pretty much every time.THE stylist and “best friend” to Meghan Markle, Jessica Mulroney, is embroiled in a race row after appearing to threaten the livelihood of black lestyle blogger Sasha Exeter.Jessica, who has apologised, has now been dropped from regular TV slots and, while the pair have reportedly spoken in private, the Duchess of Sussex has yet to support her friend publicly.Something tells me that, aside from saying: “I need to do better” regarding race and injustice in society, Jessica is about to learn another valuable lesson.Hard times will always reveal true friends.CLOTHING website Missguided has been heavily criticised by shoppers after using slim models to market its plus-range of clothes in sizes  to .One said: “This screams, ‘we want to profit from plus-sized iniduals without representing or supporting them in any way’.” Very true.Equally, those ads for accessible baths showers targeted at the elderly but featuring a woman in her forties with the agility of a mountain goat.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government’s decision not to pay for the vouchers was mean-spirited and cheap.But you do wonder about a government which decides upon a policy — and then changes it as soon as a top footballer opens his mouth.Next week, Michael Gove decides to extend trade negotiations with the EU after an intervention by Harry Kane. And lockdown is lted completely when Kyle Walker says he wants to go to another house party.Still, Rashford was right and deserves credit. And he’s right, too, that the Government could go further in helping those of us who live in poverty. The pandemic has thrown the Government off course.It was bound to. But Boris and Co must remember why they were elected last December. They got a huge mandate from our country’s very poorest regions. The areas that usually support the Labour Party.That was partly because of Brexit, of course. And partly because the then Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn , was about as effective as a recently gassed badger.But it was also because Boris promised those former Labour heartlands what they wanted to hear.A closing of the ide between rich and poor, and between London and the rest of the country.Jobs, investment in new industries and transport infrastructure.He might think we’ve all forgotten. But we haven’t. The latest poll shows Labour only five points behind the Conservatives.The honeymoon is over.Boris could begin by increasing the minimum wage for people aged  and over. It is low wages, far more than unemployment, which is keeping people mired in poverty.It wouldn’t cost the Government very much at all. It would also provide a much-needed boost to the economy.An increase in free childcare from  hours per week to  hours would also enable those struggling to make ends meet to get out of the house and work for longer.Shortly after last December’s election, Boris turned up in the North East to give his thanks.He once again promised that the region would be rejuvenated.There’s been good news on some fronts — the Nissan plant at Sunderland, for example, won out over its rival in Barcelona. It will stay open, despite the loss of  jobs.But more needs to be done to attract industry to the North and the Midlands.So far as I can see, the Government has done nothing. OK, it’s had a few problems on its hands.But when this pandemic has passed, the Government will need to intervene to help our economy — the private sector alone cannot do it.And the place to start is away from London — in the places where the new breed of Tory voter lives.Marcus Rashford’s intervention was timely and needed. This Government needs to know the poor are watching and waiting. Waiting for action, waiting for the promises of last year to be delivered.THERE is a stupidity about the woke crowd, trying to ban everything, which defies belief.An old episode of Fawlty Towers was pulled. Because it had some disturbing and potentially offensive racial material in it.But as the star of it, John Cleese, tried patiently to explain – it was SATIRE.The character of Basil Fawlty was the subject of the humour. He was mocked for his idiocies. That’s why we laughed.The episode has now been reinstated – but the moron caravan has already moved on. Now they’ve got it in for Mahatma Gandhi. Racist! The bloke who fought for India’s liberation from British colonialism.Was he a racist  Yes, without much doubt. He took a pretty jaundiced view towards Africans. But the good he did easily outweighs the bad.And believe me, there isn’t a single person born before  who didn’t possess views which today’s society would consider offensive. Regarding race, or gender, or homosexuality. Not one.Why can these people not understand that the past was dferent  And that we judge its heroes in a dferent light There was a really nasty battle between the two sides, with many dead – the first time since .China continues to bully its neighbours and oppress its own people.In this battle, I know whose side I’m on.THE Government has not done much right recently.But at least Boris and Co are binning the Department for International Development.It is to be stripped of its status and merged with the Foreign Office.With any luck, this will mean we will not be giving away any more hard-earned taxpayers’ money to countries like India, which has its own space programme so is clearly not short of a bob or two.Or China – a nasty, totalitarian state and the second richest country in the world.In the last round of spending, we actually bunged money into a programme to help Chinese people improve their diets.Nope, not kidding.I wonderit mentioned anything about it maybe not being a great idea to eat bats Various studies have suggested these donations are worthless and often counter-productive.I think, right now, we need to spend money at home, no SCIENTISTS from Japan have predicted that within  years we will be able to understand what animals are thinking. We will be communicating with them.Uh-oh. Not sure that’s good. Imagine a chat with a wasp . . .“Hi, Mr Wasp. What you doing ”“I’m crawling up your window. What’s it to you  And it’s Ms Wasp, as it happens. I’ve transitioned. So don’t misgender me. Now, p*** off before I sting you on the neck.”Worse with cats. “LOVE you  WTF, I’ve never even liked you. You’re mugs, humans. Just put the food out and give me a warm place to sleep and I’ll purr for a bit to keep you happy. Now, excuse me. I’m going to sleep on the roof of the shed for six hours.”But I might start watching it now as the cast all seem to hate each other.The soap has been torn apart by rows over the Black Lives Matter debate.Lysette Anthony has taken loads of flack and her co-star Rachel Adedeji has described her as “actual trash”.Hmm . . . somehow I suspect the show will not be anywhere near as interesting as the row.NOT everything about lockdown has been bad. Far from it.My we hasn’t been to TK Maxx for three months, for a start. There’s a mercy.And we’re not using cash. There’s little indication we will need to use cash ever again.Those people who aren’t on the breadline have saved money.And then there’s offices. Will we really go back to that awful daily commute, when the vast majority of jobs can, these days, be done at home  Just think how many homes we could createwe converted all those empty offices into flats.Offices were created because we needed a place to store paper files. Don’t really need that now, do we The Government should encourage firms to move to home-working, when – the stats suggest – employees are a lot more productive.IN France – a country almost as badly hit by Covid- as the UK – the schools will be reopening on Monday. By law, no arguments. Full curriculum.Over here, meanwhile, there are suggestions that some schools will not be opening until JANUARY and will not open properly for a year. Incredible.The Government needs to get a grip of this right now, as I argued last week.Call the bluff of the horrible trade unions and get our kids back to school.

It’s just easier than trying to do the school work.“It’s a way of escaping from everything.“I’m worried the teachers will be disappointed in me because I haven’t done enough work.“I’m worried I’ll fall behind and have to resit the year when all my friends go on.”And he is not alone. A study by University College London revealed that two million children have done barely any schoolwork at home.Since March, around  per cent of pupils have done none, or less than an hour, a day. And just  per cent put in more than four hours a day.Finn’s mum Kerrie, , a former secondary school teacher, admits she only ever sees her son at meal times.The single mum, who also has daughters Imogen, , and six-year-old Elodie, has found it hard to juggle home-schooling with working full-time as a social worker.She says: “When lockdown started I thought I’d be able to manage, especially because I used to be a teacher.“I was really motivated and ordered lots of stuff on Amazon to help. I think because the kids could see I was motivated it rubbed off on them.“But as time has gone on it’s become more dficult and challenging. I can’t give  per cent to my job and  per cent to teaching my kids. It’s just not possible.”Now Finn usually gets up around .am, has breakfast then switches on his games console — and stays up until midnight.Kerrie says: “I tried to get Finn to do schoolwork. With not enough computers for me and the kids to work, I even set written work for him.“But I couldn’t make him do it, no matter how much I encouraged him.” As we report today, more than , child health experts have signed an open letter to Boris Johnson demanding the Government publishes a clear plan to get all youngsters back to school as soon as possible or “risk scarring the le chances of a generation of young people”.The letter, organised by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, warns children are “suffering enormously” from a lack of access to exercise, vaccinations and mental health support.m have done under an hour’s work a day, experts warn PM it will ‘scar a generation’This is par­ti­cu­larly concern­ing for Clare Cashion, , when it comes to -year-old daughter Libby.Clare, a civil servant from Worcester, who is also mum to Ollie, , Lochlan, four, and two-year-old Cullann, says: “Libby has gone from being a  hardworking student to a changed character, so I do worry about her wellbeing.”Libby now stays awake until am and usually gets up at about lunchtime. Instead of doing schoolwork, she spends most of her time talking to friends on social media.She says: “At first we didn’t know what we were supposed to be doing, and because there wasn’t proper work or anyone to check your work and because you can’t just ask questions, I didn’t want to do it.“When I did do it, I didn’t get any feedback, and then my friends would tell me they hadn’t bothered, so I just thought, ‘What’s the point ’.“I’m a huge worrier and I am concerned about falling behind, but I’d rather stay up and talk to friends on my phone. That’s when everyone is online.“Mum tries to make me do more schoolwork but it doesn’t work. There just doesn’t seem much point at the moment. “I’d just like to go back to school.”In a report last month, government advisory body Sage warned lockdown had caused a “shock” to kids that will last the rest of their lives and affect work opportunities.The report also confirmed the risk of children catching coronavirus was “much lower” than adults.Yesterday, MPs on the Education Select Committee accused teaching unions of running a “disgraceful political campaign” to keep classrooms closed by “cherry picking” evidence to make parents fear schools are “death traps”.Chairman Robert Halfon asked: “Can you explain why parents and children can have access to Primark over the coming weeks and months but not to schools ”For Libby and Clare, it will be a big relief when schools can reopen. Clare says: “School has now started online lessons, so one week they’ll be live, and  Libby has taken part in some, but the following week it’s just emails and sometimes they have to cancel.“I think Libby struggles with not knowing exactly what’s expected.”Finn is just as desperate to get back in the classroom.He said: “I really want to go back to school because it’s a lot easier to learn in a classroom with a teacher explaining the work, and I miss my independence.“I’ve found it really dficult being at home this long.”To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One day scaremongering, the next denouncing the Tories for betraying kids.The reality is that Boris should now bin the -pupil class size limit and the crazy two-metre distancing edict. There is minimal evidence to support either.Then he must order schools to reopen.The shutdown is wrecking children’s education every day it grinds on.IT is vital for our economy and sanity that we can take a holiday from early July.So we urge the PM: Thrash out a deal with President Macron today, allowing free travel with France with no quarantine. Rapidly make similar “air bridge” deals with Spain, Portugal and Greece.Better still, replace the crippling, job-destroying absurdity of quarantine — its rules are too slack to work, anyway — with temperature checks at airports.Then get our hotels and B’n’Bs open for a tsunami of “staycations”.Do it now, before summer is gone and a vast number of tourism jobs with it.IT was fantastic to have the Prem back last night.

Teachers will head back to schools for the original target date - August  - to get classrooms ready for students. The guidance has a day one focus that concentrates on social distancing and hygiene considerations within school settings, Mr Weir wrote. The letter said: The Northern Ireland Executive has agreed that the current social distancing guidance of m must continue to be followed between all adults within the education sector, but that a distance of m is safe and appropriate between children and young people.Using protective bubbles has been supported by the Department of Health and PHA, and flexing their use to m will allow full classes to attend.The m guidance between children is to be followed as far as possible within the confines of the physical capacity of each classroom and the m rule for staff adhered to fully.To facilitate these arrangements, schools will be opening in week commencing  August for preparation purposes, he said.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said this evening the Department for Education was looking at a relaxation for the rule in England. He said: We are working on what is needed to get all schools open in September.I do get the interaction between  metre rule and getting people back to school.But the  metre rule is itself a social distancing measure, so removing it has an impact in terms of the transmission of the disease. So we have to make sure in that review...the virus is under control enough to make the change and to replace the  metre rule,that is the conclusion, with something that makes it easier to do, for instance, getting people back to school.Northern Ireland has now dropped guidance for people who were shielding because the threat of becoming severely ill from the virus was so high. Health Minister Robin Swann said people should still be cautious when out and about and follow strict social distancing.The news comes as: Children in reception, year one and year six are currently back in schools in England, with all students expected to be back in classrooms by September.Boris Johnson announced a full review into the metre rule in England earlier this week, as hospitality industry leaders piled pressure on the PM to relax the rule.

The virus is still in general circulation, and localised outbreaks are likely to occur.“We have made progress against the virus thanks to the efforts of the public and we need the public to continue to follow the guidelines carefully to ensure this progress continues.”  The Prime Minister unveiled the five-stage coronavirus warning system as part of a gradual easing of the lockdown during a televised address on May .He said he was establishing a new joint biosecurity centreto run the alert system, which is similar to that used to establish the terrorist threat.The group would detect increases in Covid- infection rates and judge how strict lockdown measures and social distancing rules should be.Two factors determine the UKs coronavirus threat level - the R number and the number of confirmed Covid- infections at any one time.The alert levels range from level one - green - to level five - red.When the scheme was launched, the country was at level four, which means a Covid- epidemic is in general circulation, transmission is high or rising exponentially.The system says that current social distancing measures and restrictions should remain in place.Level five is when transmission is high or rising but also when there was a risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed and will require an increase in social distancing measures.Level one means Covid- is no longer known to be in the UK and the only action should be routine international monitoring.Level three is when the epidemic is in general circulation and gradual easing of restrictions can take place, while level two is when the number of cases and transmission is low and no or minimal restrictions are required.But under level two there will be enhanced testing, tracing, monitoring and screening.At the end of May, Mr Johnson told MPs that were coming down the Covid alert system from level four to level three tomorrow, we hope, were going to be taking a decision tomorrow.But the alert level was not lowered - despite the easing of some restrictions - and it remained at four until now.Representatives from industries, such as the hospitality sector, may hope it could also pave the way for the two-metre rule to be relaxed which is key for many pubs, restaurants and cafes to reopen.Prof Matt Keeling, of Warwick University, believes the downgrade is currently justied but cautions against the easing of social distancing.He said: The move to level three is not a time for complacency, there is still the prospect of a second wavecontrols are relaxed too quickly and the reproductive numberrises above one.We are likely to be entering a new phase of this outbreak, where nationally and regionally cases will continue to decline, but locally there will be isolated clusters of cases that need to be contained.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For example, nuts are a great source of magnesium and vitamin E, an antioxidant that protects the body from damaging free radicals. These can cause oxidative tissue damage, triggering inflammation that contributes to problems like allergies and asthma.”Whether you like them chopped up in a salad or on top of a burger, turns out red onions are more than just a crunch addition to your dinner.Theyre rich in a chemical that can actually ward off a blocked nose and itchy eyes.“Eating foods rich in quercetin, a natural anti-histamine, such as capers, red onions and apples, can be helpful, according to Max.Also,you eat pineapple which contains bromelain, that helps the body absorb the quercetin.”Some of us may fear brown food, but lets face it, its much better for us than its white counterpart.Not only is it packed full of immunity boosting vitamins but you might even notice a dference with your weight too as theyre usually lower in fat.Max says: “Legumes, whole grains and tofu are high in zinc, which has an antibacterial and antiviral effect in the body and fosters immunity.Examples of legumes are lentils, chickpeas, peas, beans, soybeans, and peanuts, and whole grains include brown rice, oatmeal, barley, buckwheat, bulgur wheat and millet.”Good news, Vindaloo lovers - a super hot curry may help to blow those symptoms away.Capsicin, the stuff that gives chilies their heat, is known to help open up the nasal passages and relieve that bunged up feeling.But just make sure youve got a box of tissues to hand.“Spicy foods and horseradish can have natural decongestant effects, Max says.Use with caution though, as they may also irritate the throat, resulting in excess mucous and cough.”Instead of pouring a load of salt and pepper on your chips, why not go fancy and add rosemary.Not only will it look like something you might order in a posh burger bar, but the seasoning could actually help with hay fever symptoms.“Season your food with rosemary as it opens up the respiratory system, helping to reduce inflammation and encourages better breathing, according to Max.Okay, so we know tea doesnt count as a food but what you drink is definitely a part of your diet.So,you wake up each morning totally bunged up and reach for a coffee then you might want to reconsider.Max says: “Drinking hot tea with lemon and honey first thing in the morning activates movement of the hairs in the nose, which some people believe will prevent early morning sneezing with allergies or hay fever.“Drinking camomile tea can help as it has anti-inflammatory properties and contains azulene, a natural antihistamine.”“Nettle tea can also be beneficial. Stinging nettles are thought to be able to reduce the amount of histamine in the body and can help with unwanted symptoms such as a stuffy nose, itching eyes and sneezing.”He added: “Peppermint tea may help to ease a blocked nose.”. MushroomsWhether its chucking more in your next risotto or asking for extra on tonights pizza takeaway, consider the benefits of the humble mushroom.“Mushrooms contain higher levels of polysaccharides, which encourage the body to switch off the part of the immune system that reacts to antibodies and cause those unwanted hay fever symptoms, Max says.Reishi mushrooms,you can get hold of them, contain high levels of polysaccharides.”Its another simple one to increase in your diet - as long as you dont mind having a stinky breath.Max says: Fresh, raw garlic contains quercetin, a natural antihistamine. It’s also anti-catarrhal and contains vitamin C.”Some foods can actually make hay fever symptoms a lot worse... and its bad newsyoure a chocoholic.Max says: “Chocolate and alcohol contain histamine, the chemical that sets off allergy symptoms in your body. So whilst you might not want to give these up completely, reducing your intake might help.”He added: “Avoid dairy drinks which may encourage the body to produce mucus.Excess mucus is exactly what you don’t needyou suffer from hay fever. Instead, drink water, fruit tea, herb tea or any non-caffeinated tea.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The smaller the area being considered the greater the effect on the R value of a cluster. A small cluster of Covid- cases can lead to an apparent rise in R which does not give the true reflection of local risk. Today Sage experts warned the R rate does not tell us how quickly an epidemic is changing, pointing out that dferent diseases with the same R rate can result in epidemics that grow at dferent speeds.  For example,a disease has an R rate of  and infection lasts years, it will grow much more slowly than another disease with an R rate of  where infection lasts days.As a result, for the first time the Government, has published the coronavirus growth rates, for the UK, England and the regions.The growth rate reflects how quickly the number of infections are changing day-by-day.The Government said today: It is an approximation of the change of number of infections each day.If the growth rate is greater than zero , then the disease will grow.If the growth rate is less than zero then the disease will shrink.The currently growth rate for the UK as a whole is -% to -%, while in England it stands at -% to -% - indicating the epidemic is shrinking faster in the UK than in England.In all areas of the UK except London the growth rate is negative. In the capital it lies somewhere between -% to +. All other regions are below the crucial threshold of zero.A Sage spokesman said: Growth rates provide us with dferent information to R estimates, by informing us of the size and speed of change, whereas R value only gives us information on the direction of change.If the growth rate is greater than zero - or positive - the disease will grown. But below zero and negative, is a sign its shrinking.The growth rates in the regions are:UK: -% to -%England: -% to -%East of England: -% to -%London: -% to +%Midlands: -% to %North East and Yorkshire: -% to -%North West: -% to %South East: -% to -%South West: -% to %The R value and growth rate for the UK and England paint a hopeful picture of an epidemic that is heading in the right direction.It comes in a week where lockdown was eased further, with non-essential shops reopening their doors on Monday, and shoppers flocking to queue after three months away from the high street.Todays lowering of the Covid- alert level by the Joint Biosecurity Centre marks another positive step.The Governments chief medical officers, led by Prof Chris Whitty, say transmission of the bug is no longer high or rising exponentially.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.The move to Level  allows for the gradual relaxation of restrictions and social distancing measures - raising hopes the two-metre rule could be scrapped, a move which could breathe much-need le into businesses closed for months, and mark a move towards getting all kids back to school.A joint statement from the four CMOs, said: The Joint Biosecurity Centre has recommended that the Covid- alert level should move from Level to Level  .There has been a steady decrease in cases we have seen in all four nations, andthis continues.It does not mean that the pandemic is over.

Nick Gibb declined to say children would definitelyin full in September - saying only it was the governmentaposs intention. It raises the prospect of a possible fresh setback to school opening dates after unions warned the September date was impossible. Boris Johnson has repeatedly insisted he wants all children in England toto school from September.But teaching unions say the maths doesn’t work under current distancing rules - which force schools to split pupils into -strong aposbubblesapos, doubling the number of classes. The National Education Union has called on the government to use public buildings for extra classroom space and use blended learning, with a mixture between home and classroom. Mr Gibb was challenged today over whether the September date could become another U-turn. He told Sky News: Well our clear intention is schools will reopen for all pupils in September. We’re led of course by the science and the medical advice. He added: We are taking every step in a cautious way, we’re working with the school sector, we’re taking advice.  And we give schools plenty of notice and time to plan for that reopening in September. Of course we’re working on other contingency plans, but the clear intention is we will have all children back in school in September. A third of Englandaposs primary schools are still not fully open to years R,  and  despite being asked to do so since June . And plans to reopen primary school years , ,  and  by July were dropped when government officials accepted there wasnapost enough space. The growing crisis in education in England has seen millions of kids unable to attend classes since the unprecedented Covid- lockdown ordered in March.Parents have been battling to homeschool youngsters amid fears some will fall behind their peers. A report by University College Londonaposs Institute of Education found two million children have done less than an hour a day of schoolwork during the lockdown. Today the government announced a £billion catch-up package to stop kids being left behind. Some £million will be shared across state primaries and secondary schools over the next academic year. And a £million National Tutoring Programme will boost access to tuition for the poorest kids. But the cash includes nothing for nurseries or further education colleges. And is not clear about how much support will be given over the summer holidays because it is up to heads how to spend the cash. Mr Gibb admitted the funding made available for schools will only start to be distributed from September. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he said: The money will start to be paid in the academic year starting in September. Schools will know itaposs coming and they will be able to budget on that basisthey want to do things before September.

The four Chief Medical Officers for the four nations of the UK agreed it should be reduced from Level  to Level . It means the Covid- epidemic is in general circulation, but transmission is no longer high or rising exponentially. Itaposs finally happened after the government claimed for weeks that it was moving towards . Health Secretary Matt Hancock boasted it is a big moment for the country, and a real testament to the British people’s determination to beat this virus. But it doesnapost actually make much dference to how the UK will come out of lockdown. Thataposs because after a massive row over the alert level, the government claimed it doesnapost actually make a dference to easing restrictions. So what is the alert level and what dference will todayaposs announcement make to your le  Weaposve had a took. What are the coronavirus alert levels   There are five alert levels, set by a Joint Biosecurity Centre that was established in May to deal with the pandemic. They are:Level  COVID- is not known to be present in the UK Level  COVID- is present in the UK, but the number of cases and transmission is low Level  A COVID- epidemic is in general circulation Level  A COVID- epidemic is in general circulation transmission is high or rising exponentially Level  As level  and there is a material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmedWhat is the UK Covid- alert level now  As of Friday  June the alert level is three, meaning a COVID- epidemic is in general circulation. That is down from level four, as the alert level had been since the system was set up in May. Who agrees the UK alert level   Changes to the alert level are recommended by the JBC and then signed off by the four Chief Medical Officers in the four nations of the UK. In other words, despite Boris Johnson claiming for weeks that it was moving towards , he does not have direct power to change the alert level. The level is set primarily by R - the number of new people each carrier is infecting - and the overall number of coronavirus cases. What is the alert level actually used for   Thereaposs a big debate about some of this. We know from the roadmap for easing lockdown, published on May , that the alert level is designed to communicate the current level of risk clearly to the public. So itaposs a bit like the terror threat level. It crunches of all the risks facing the UK into one star rating, to give the public a vague idea of how bad things are. It shows the threat now - not the potential future threatthe virus spins out of control again. Whataposs controversial is how much the alert level affects lockdown directly. When it was first announced in May, the government said there was a link - but now it claims there isnapost a link at all. What did the government say before   When the alert level system was set up in May, the government linked it to the easing of lockdown. In a slide on May  , is said that at level , current social distancing measures and restrictions remain. Only at level  would there be a gradual relaxing of restrictions and social distancing measures. And at level  there would be no or minimal social distancing measures. And Boris Johnson said on May : That Covid Alert Level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures – the lower the level the fewer the measures. The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.  The government has since changed its tune and made clear any changes to lockdown are not based on the alert level. Instead, No says lockdown changes are based on the five tests for easing lockdown:The NHS is able to cope A sustained fall in deaths New infections dropping enough Adequate testing and PPE No risk of a second peak that overwhelms NHSThis prompted a massive row when the government started easing lockdown in England - opening schools and shops, and letting groups of six meet outdoors - despite the high alert level. Questioned on June , the PMaposs spokesman appeared to rewrite history. He said the government were always clear that changes to lockdown were based on the separate five tests - not the alert levels. Why did the row happen  We still donapost fully know. Perhaps itaposs possible that early No literature - including Boris Johnsonaposs address to the nation - was produced in error or when the policy wasnapost properly settled. But what we do know is this. Using the five tests, rather than the alert level, allowed some political input into the decision to ease lockdown. Rather than basing it entirely on the science about the virus, Boris Johnson could also base his decision on other factors like the economy. We also know it took a long time for the Joint Biosecurity Centre - which sets the alert level - to be ready. On June , three weeks after it was announced, No admitted the Joint Biosecurity Centre was not yet fully up and running”.

His portentous, I-am-serious-me statement did not add so I can f*** it right up at the end, but it might as well have done.As Britain emerges from lockdown and , excess deaths, mostly due to the virus getting a bit tired rather than any brilliance on the governmentaposs part, blame is being bundled up in preparation for the Prime Ministerial reshuffle which will send it as far away as possible.One of the recipients will be the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, whose response to a health pandemic has been to destroy the health and social care of as many people as possible, with a level of incompetence that is close to brilliantly awful.  At the start of April, Apple and Google joined forces to use smartphones to trace coronavirus outbreaks. Within days, journalists were briefed the NHS was developing its own version, available in weeks, to ease lockdown. The fact UK local authorities had public health officials trained in tracing disease outbreaks was barely mentioned.On April , Halfcocked announced: Today I wanted to outline the next step: a new NHS app for contact tracing [...] We’re already testing this app and as we do this we’re working closely with the world’s leading tech companies and renowned experts in digital safety and ethics.”On April  it was reported Apple had refused to downgrade its privacy rules, which the NHS app needed to work.On April  Halfcocked said the app was crucial and would be rolled out in a matter of weeks. On April , a parliamentary committee was told it would be ready in a fortnight, and the Apple Google version of a tracing app had been rejected as it would slow us down quite considerably. All tracing apps rely on bluetooth connections between phones, but they store data dferently. The UK insisted all contacts be uploaded automatically onto a central server, regardless of health status Apple and Google kept data offline on your phone, pinging warnings out to anonymised contacts only when an infection is confirmed. The international version would also be built into operating systems, putting it on billions of phones worldwide, rather than relying on people specically downloading it.Most of the world went with Apple and Google. In Europe, only Britain and France insisted on a homebrew. On April  Germany switched sides, announcing a national app would not run on iPhones unless the screens were unlocked and the app running.Halfcocked doubled down. By then contracts had been signed with a bunch of private companies to provide software engineers, data processing centres, and servers.On April , the government announced the app would be tested on the Isle of Wight. Hancock said it was islandersapos civic duty to download it. On May , the Health Service Journal reported claims it was not fit for inclusion in the NHSapos own app library, had not passed basic cybersecurity tests, and was “wobbly”. On May , barristers warned the government might be sued over privacy and data protection concerns, and cyber experts said it was open to trolling, and foreign spies shutting down entire cities with fake reports.The same day, Halfcocked said the app was a very, very positive step in terms of us all being able to get some of our liberty back”. It was reported, again, the app wouldnapost work on locked iPhones, and would make safe international travel impossible.On May , Isle of Wight users said it didnapost work on older iPhones, Australia announced it was going with Apple Google after its own app didnapost work well enough, and the government had given £.m to a Swiss firm to seeit could somehow blend the Apple technology with the British app.On May , it was revealed the NHSX app was being rebuilt. On May , the government said it was not. Experts, again, said they were worried the NHSX version relied on self-reporting, rather than a diagnostic test, leaving it open to trolls and abuse. On May , NHSX finally admitted the app didnapost work on older phones. On May , MPs heard the UK app would not work with the Irish version, so any cross-border infections in Northern Ireland would not be picked up.Yet on May , Halfcocked boasted to Parliament: We now have the elements we need to roll out our national Test  Trace service – the testing capacity, the tracing capability and the technology. It was announced, again, the app would be rolled out within weeks.  Apple and Google launched their app - the one that would slow us down - on May . Four days later, the Department of Health gave £million to local authorities so their public health experts could help with tracking and tracing.On May , the Mirror revealed the PMaposs chief adviser had broken lockdown rules while infectious. On May , we revealed heaposd done so twice. On May , Halfcocked set , human contract tracers to work before the app was ready, and said he was getting people used to the idea. A DoH announcement said it would be complemented by the app in coming weeks. On May , he bent maths to announce heaposd hit his target of , tests a day early.  Halfcocked did not mention the app in his opening statements at the daily coronavirus briefings on June , ,  or . On June  the UK Statistics Authority said his figures were far from complete and comprehensible. On June , he thanked Serco - one of the firms involved in the app - for its assistance in the tracing programme.This week, Parliament was told the app would not be ready until winter and, besides, it was not a priority. Yesterday,  weeks after sanity required it, the government abandoned it.Turns out, the NHSX app didnapost work on older phones. It drained battery le. There were privacy concerns. Oh, and it and only traced % of an infected personaposs contacts, so you might as well have thrown all those millions into the English Channel along with a few thousand extra dead bodies.It was going to be available in weeks,  weeks ago. It was being tested, before the code was even written. The much-slower Apple Google app was produced quicker, works better, and was probably cheaper. Country after country hit problems and changed direction, but Halfcocked ploughed on. Sources, leaks, experts, and barristers all pointed out issues, but millions were spaffed up a wall trying to get the Swiss to do something weaposd have been sued for. Most of the developed world now has a phone app but we do not, and Halfcocked refuses to tell us when we might.Itaposs now obvious the app would never have achieved the critical mass of % that Parliament was told it needed, and that contact tracing was botched, then rushed out early to save embarrassment over ious Cummings and goings. Easing lockdown is now even less safe than it was, which was not very.And it seems as though Halfcocked is the worst kind of gambler - stupid. He fell for the apossunk cost fallacyapos - the idea that,you spend enough cash, a payout is guaranteed. Iceland has the worldaposs highest uptake of a coronavirus-tracing app, at % of its population. Its health minister has said it was not a game-changer. The UK government must have known, but gave millions to tech firms rather than the public health officials who were actually capable of saving lives.

Elizabeth Manuel, , was forced to shut herself off from the world when the government announced vulnerable people and the over s should not leave home for  weeks. She lost her sight after suffering a near fatal brain hemorrhage and stroke at the age of . But as millions of people raced to the supermarket and selfishly stripped shelves of essentials - Elizabeth became one of the unfortunate needy Brits left without basic supplies.As she shielded at her Portsmouth home soon after the country entered lockdown - she was then struck down with coronavirus.Describing her terrying ordeal, Elizabeth said the virus choked her of breath as she desperately tried to call  for an ambulance.Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog hereShe said: I was one of the first people in early March told to self-isolate - from that point on I had no contact with anyone as I live completely on my own. I then went from the vulnerable to the extremely vulnerable category. And to add to the excitement, I ended up being diagnosed with coronavirus. I started off with a headache and then had a persistent cough that went into bad breathing dficulties. After  hours I knew I needed some urgent help and I had to call  because I simply could not breath. But I couldnapost even ask for an ambulance - I had no breath to speak and I had to press buttons to identy where I was. I then went to open the door for paramedics as I thought I could lose consciousness before they arrived. Elizabeth was admitted to hospital for three nights as she recovered from the worst part of her illness.  But after being confirmed well enough to go home, she ed to her empty house - struggling to get out of bed for three weeks while panicking about where her food was going to come from. Elizabeth, who despite her own blindness and lockdown struggles, signed up as an NHS volunteer in the hope of helping from home, also spoke about her struggles with supermarkets shops and deliveries. As supplies in her cupboards and fridge dwindled, Elizabeth panicked about how she would feed herself without any help. Despite writing to supermarkets, her local MP and local crisis groups, Elizabeth said she was made to feel worthless when nobody offered immediate help. She said: I knew I really needed food so tried internet shopping but there were no slots. Every day I would go online and there would be no slots, I was getting very axious. I wrote to the supermarkets because at that point there was nothing in terms of a priority slot. Then under government rules I went from being vulnerable to extremely vulnerable.  I was contacting people telling them I had about a weekaposs worth of food in my freezer and that was it. It made me feel worthless and one of the worst things about lockdown is I have felt more disabled now than i ever have since having my stroke. Elizabeth also said her anxiety about ing to the outside world after lockdown ends is also much higher.

The home in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, looks ordinary from the outside, but inside it is packed with newspapers dating back to , stopped clocks, a half-smoked pipe, and the owneraposs shoes left by the bed years after the property was vacated. Photographer Rebecca was invited in to see the decaying cottage after its owner died and she was left in awe of the haunting scenes within the perfectly preserved home. The cottage was lived in until  by the last of three brothers, who kept all of their family history, alongside tins of food from the early th century left unopened on the kitchen shelves.A man only identied as Dessie was the last to live there, leading aposa solitary le among the relics of the pastapos before moving into a home in  and passing away two years later. Rebecca, who owns the Abandoned NI website sharing photos of the derelict houses she explores, was allowed in by the owner to get a record of the incredible space before it was knocked down to make way for a new build. She said she was left gobsmacked by what she found, with old books, magazines, papers and photographs littered around the farm workeraposs cottage and left untouched. A clock on the mantel piece is stuck showing ., a pair of glasses are left ready to pick up and a rusted OXO tin has been left open, with two pocket watches stored inside. Hundreds of handwritten letters fill the drawers, and three kettles are sat on the stove, next to a cup which appears to have been placed there just before it was abandoned. Old books and newspapers including the Mid Ulster Mail from  were left sitting in the living room which had been shut off for more than  years, alongside one newspaper which reported the aftermath of the sinking of the Titanic in . Upstairs there remained rotting bedclothes, a bed pan on the floor and a flat cap left hanging on the end of a bedframe. Rebecca said she initially wasnapost surethe interior would be very interesting, but she has now created an exhibition based on the lives of Dessie and his family.

I went into what I thought was a wee cottage and itaposs basically a social history museum. The cottage first appeared on maps in  and Rebecca began researching the family to help piece together the puzzle in all of the photographs. After talking to people to find out more about Dessie, she said: Among many things he was a fabulous cook, many friends still talk about his famous soda bread which he cooked over the original stove.

He also joked with staff that George, Charlotte and Louis had been attacking the kitchen during the lockdown and revealed that Kate has been doing a lot of baking. During her visit, Kate explained that most trips outside since lockdown have been to buy food but said that itaposs now so important, now as things ease, people know they can go out and particularly to places like this. She said that George, Charlotte and Louis loved visiting garden centres, calling them great spaces for children and families. She also revealed that the family have been growing tomatoes during the lockdown. She heard how the centre was forced to close for seven weeks but has since reopened, in line with government guidelines, following social distancing rules. She also chatted to customers during her visit. Itaposs the first time Kate has been seen publicly since the March, when she visited a  call centre in London. She has been working through the pandemic, but has been carrying out engagements remotely. The Cambridge family have been staying at their Norfolk home Anmer Hall, where Kate and William have been home-schooling George and Charlotte. William chatted to staff at Smiths the Bakers, in the High Street in Kingaposs Lynn, Norfolk, a short drive from their countryside home.  He was given a personalised vanilla sponge cake with white icing, cream and jam cake ahead of his th birthday on Sunday. It was decorated with Union flags and footballs and had the message: Happy Birthday Prince William from all at Smiths the Bakers. The duke heard how the bakery, which has been trading since  and holds a Royal Warrent, was managing during the pandemic.  Paul Brandon, who runs the bakery business with his we Teresa, told the duke that he had read that he had done some baking during lockdown. Iaposve done a little bit of baking, William said. The children have been attacking the kitchen and itaposs just been an explosion of flour and chocolate everywhere. Catherineaposs been doing quite a bit of baking.  William also bought some treats for his family, telling staff: I canapost come in here and not buy anything, so have you got any pain au chocolat at all  Have you got any more by any chance  My children will not talk to meI turn up without enough. He asked for five pain au chocolat but there were not enough in the shop, so he opted for four pain au chocolat and a plain croissant. Taking out his card to pay the £. total by contactless, the duke said I hope this works, before the transaction went through. Good, itaposs still working - first time out in a while!  The duke was told how the bakery shop took the decision to close its doors soon after lockdown was announced as so few people were visiting the High Street, before reopening on Monday. The business ran a home-delivery service while its shop was closed. William heard how most of the bakeryaposs business comes from wholesale, including to schools which closed during lockdown, but is now starting to see customersto the shop. He said: The important thing is that shops like yours can get the footfall back in again and the High Street and town feel like itaposs getting a little bit more back to normal. Because I think everyoneaposs just been, you know, itaposs like theyaposve just been in a daze.They donapost quite know what to make of it all.William heard how the bakeryaposs products currently have to be sealed with plastic film.Itaposs a shame because we were doing quite well on the anti-plastic and then this comes along and we have to protect the food. Itaposs heartbreaking, he said. The duke cleaned his hands with hand sanitiser on arrival and was told about safety measures at the bakery, including limiting the number of people in store at once.In a lighter moment, he joked: I was saying the other day about how Iaposm worried about the waistline of the nation.I think weaposve all eaten so many cakes and chocolate. All the NHS team, theyaposre so grateful, all the local communities have been giving them loads and loads of sweets and chocolate, which is great for them.  They must be enormous now and brushing their teeth five times a day, with the amount of sugar. William also spoke to bakery trainee Ted Bartram and furloughed tearoom deputy manager Sarah Easthall about how they have been coping. He was also given a loaf of Norfolk crunch bread and a jar of Sandringham loose tea. After the duke left, Mr Brandon said: Heaposs a very pleasant guy.  Itaposs very nice of him to come and see us. Being as he lives only down the road, to think heaposs taken an interest in his local town and his local businesses, thataposs good.The Duke ed to work earlier this week when he visited Kingaposs Lynn Ambulance Station at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital on Tuesday.He  joked with NHS heroes who have been working on the frontline about how he is concerned about Britsapos waistlines after spending three months indoors, and said he canapost wait to get back to the pub.  He passed a Covid- temperature test and washed his hands before stopping himself from shaking hands with hard-working staff from the East of England Ambulance Service Trust . William, , said: Iaposm still fighting the urge to shake hands. Iaposm keeping my hands by my side.

German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters said the first letter was to forewarn the family about the German authorities publicly announcing on June  that this is a murder inquiry and that Madeleine is dead. Mr Wolters added they wrote to the family at a later date too, with The Sun suggesting this letter was posted last week. The prosecutor has told Italian daily la Repubblica that while he didnapost write either letter, the Federal Police in conjunction with ourselves and the British got in touch with the family.  But the British couple said on Wednesday they had not received any letter from Germany stating their daughter is dead. It comes after criticism of the way Gerry and Kate McCann have been treated by that countryaposs auth­orities investigating convicted rapist Christian Brueckner, . Brueckner, jailed in the German city of Kiel, is the prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine from Praia da Luz in Portugal in  when she was three.  In a statement released earlier this week, Kate and Gerry said: The widely reported news that we have a received a letter from the German authorities that states there is evidence or proof that Madeleine is dead is FALSE. It comes as reports suggest police in Germany and Portugal have reportedly clashed over sharing DNA evidence that could lead to a breakthrough. German investigators want to retest a mystery saliva sample found in the holiday apartment the British toddler vanished from. The Portuguese police are reportedly unwilling to budge, with a source close to the Policia Judiciaria labelling re-testing a total waste of time. The evidence was found on the youngster’s bed inside apartment A at the Ocean Club by forensic teams after she went missing in .

The -year-old posted a photo of herself covered in colourful squares and what looks like cream cake in a celebratory post early this morning. The youngest ever Nobel Prize laureate also shared a snap of her and her family posing with balloons and a large cake which reads: Happy graduation Malala. She wrote: Hard to express my joy and gratitude right now as I completed my Philosophy, Politics and Economics degree at Oxford.I don’t know what’s ahead. For now, it will be Netflix, reading and sleep.Like many students this year Malala has graduated in unusual circumstances. Universities across the country have closed to students and non-essential staff, meaning exams could not go ahead as usual. The typically raucous celebrations expected after an intense exam season have also not been able to go ahead, with graduates like Malala having to toast their successes at home instead. The human rights activist came to the worldaposs attention when she was  and a blog she had written about le as a girl in Taliban-controlled Swat Valley caught the eye of journalist Adam B. Ellick.  The subsequent New York Times documentary gave Malala a  to speak about the suppression of girlsapos education in the region. Eight years ago a Taliban gunman attempted to assassinate her for her activism, plunging the then -year-old into a critical condition with a bullet to the head. She was transferred to a hospital in Birmingham, UK where she recovered before setting up a le in the country.Malala co-authored the best-selling book aposI am Malalaapos in  and jointly won the  Nobel Peace Prize along with Kailash Satyarthi.

At the heart of this would be a mobile app Health Secretary Matt Hancock said would allow the tracking of Covid- on a mass scale. The latest figures show the programme has failed to reach more than a quarter of people who tested positive and the app has been ditched after it was found not to work. Other countries moved quickly to work with Apple and Google to develop a tracing app. The UK, contrary to what the Health Secretary said yesterday, decided it knew better. Once again, the Government has been found wanting. Time and again since the outbreak, ministers have made boastful promises but then failed to deliver on them. This incompetence has not just wasted public money – it has cost lives. We are beating the world only when it comes to the multiple failures by this Tory administration and the mounting number of fatalities. Best of British Dame Vera Lynn was the voice that gave our nation hope amid the horror of war. It was a testament to her enduring appeal that her classic hit We’ll Meet Again became the anthem not just of the Second World War but the coronavirus crisis  years on.  Throughout her  years, she epitomised the best of British spirit, whether mucking in with troops in Burma or doing her charity work. It is poignant she died on the th anniversary of Churchill’s “finest hour” speech. While the former Prime Minister rallied the nation at its darkest moment, she lted its spirits.

As a marine biology student, the -year-old was desperate to get close to some of the most impressive beasts on the planet. Alongside her studies, Keltie also worked as a part-time trainer at Sealand in British Columbia in Canada. The popular attraction had first opened in  and was home to an orca called Haida, who had been captured the year before. He was a huge hit and aquarium bosses soon wanted a mate for him and caught Chimo, a killer whale who was a partial albino. Tragically, the orca died just two years later and Haida mourned her death, remaining alone for several years. But Sealand was not deterred and captured a second female orca, Nootka II, to be Haidaaposs mate. She died just nine months after arriving at Sealand. A third mate, Nootka III, then arrived at the aquarium, but Haida had absolutely no interest in her. By now, orcas were big business and when Dr Murray Newman, Sealandaposs founder, got a call from a man claiming to be feeding an injured killer whale calf by hand in the ocean, he went to investigate. The young orca, who they named Miracle, was suffering from a bullet wound and Sealand was granted permission to transport him for emergency care. Benefiting from the medical attention, Miracle soon became a popular attraction but had to be kept separated from Haida. But after a few years, tragedy struck when Shadow, Miracleaposs aquarium seal companion, died after drowning in the nets surrounding the pen they shared. Chillingly, Sealand er Larry McInerney told the documentary Who Killed Miracle  that Miracle had learned that by damaging the nets ers would come into her pen. It meant she could play with them but over the years she became more aggressive and this caused problems for the drivers, who struggled to keep up with maintenance on her pen. She too died a few years later and in the uproar that followed owners agreed to release Haida back into the wild. Sadly, he passed away just days before his release, although there was no evidence of foul play. Soon after, Sealand brought three new orcas to the aquarium - Tilikum, Nookta IV and Haida II. The three killer whales had been captured in Iceland after they were told to stop taking orcas from the water around Washington. But the relationship between the three orcas was far from harmonious. For almost a year, the three huge orcas were kept in a holding tank near Reykjavík, before they could be transported to Canada. Tilikum, who was now around  and a half feet long, could only swim slowly in circles or simply lie on the surface of the water. Gone were the sounds of the ocean that he had been used to for the first two years of his le, replaced with the low hum of the mechanical filtration that kept his tank clean. Tilikum, which means friend in Chinock, was finally moved to his new home on Sealand at the end of  - but this would be where his nightmare would begin. Tilikum, the youngest of the three was said to be bullied and chased by the two bigger and older females. Orca pods are dominated by females but there are reports that even after Haida II had become established as the leader, she still bullied Tilikum. This seemed to escalate at night so as soon as the final show of the day was over the three huge beasts of the deep were shoved into metal pods that were just  feet across and  feet deep. This would be their home for the next  hours before they were needed to perform again. One trainer, who worked at Sealand for two years in the late s, said the orcas would often emerge the following day with scratches and cuts from where they had rubbed against the side of their pods. Seven days a week, the orcas had to perform every hour, eight times a day and it seemed to be taking its toll. Both Nootka and Tilikum suffered from stomach ulcers and had to be given medication. And each of the whales had their own, distinct, personality. Tilikum, the youngest, was the most playful - he was described as youthful, energetic and eager to learn. Biologist Eric Walters, who was working at Sealand at the time, said: Tilikum was our favorite. He was the one we all really liked to work with. Nootka was unpredictable, possibly because of her health problems and had bitten her trainers and even a blind woman in the audience who had been invited to pat her. Sealand eventually recruited help from Bruce Stephens, a former SeaWorld head trainer, who was asked to make recommendations to improve practices at the aquarium. He is said to have given each trainer a handbook, which warnedyou fail to provide your animals with the excitement they need, you may be certain they will create the excitement themselves. The move was welcomed by biologist Eric but soon he realised it seemed to have made little dference. He said: They basically ran it like you would run McDonaldaposs. It just canapost be good for an animal that is so intelligent to do the same thing every day. It wasnapost long before Bruceaposs warnings began to take shape. The orcas would pounce on anythnig new that landed in the water. And they wouldnapost give it up freely, playing with items and refusing to hand them back to the trainers. By May , Eric had quit his job at Sealand and wrote a scathing letter to the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies, highlighting the safety concerns he had about the aquarium. He had a chilling final warning: I feel that sooner or later someone is going to get seriously hurt. Then on February , , just as the final killer whale show finished for the day, Keltie Byrne was tidying up when she slipped and fell half into the pool. She struggled to pull herself out but before she could haul herself back onto dry land, one of the whales had pulled her in. Keltie was a competitive swimmer but even so, she couldnapost escape the predators of the ocean. Head of animal training at Sealand at the time, Steve Huxter, said: They never had a plaything in the pool that was so interactive. They just got incredibly excited and stimulated. By now, the other trainers had realised something was seriously wrong and were frantically trying to attract the attention of the three orcas. They were throwing food into the water to seethey could distract them and bellowing recall commands. In a last ditch attempt to help Keltie, they three a le ring close enough for her to grab - but working together, the orcas kept her away from it. It was dark and chaotic and the trainers desperately trying to help from the pool side couldnapost determine which of the killer whales had hold of Keltie. Twice she managed to reach the surface and each time her horrying screams for help echoed around the pool. After  minutes of being Tilikum, Haida and Nooktaaposs play thing, Keltie bobbed to the surface for a final time. This time, she was silent - the student had drowned. Eyewitness Nadine Kallen said at the time: She went up and down three times. They almost got her once with the hook pole, but they couldn’t - the whales were moving so fast. An inquest found that the orcas had prevented Keltie from getting out of the pool and ruled her drowning death an accident. Little more than  months after Keltieaposs tragic death, Sealand closed its doors for good. SeaWorld bought all three of the orcas, with Tilikum and Nookta moving to Orlando, while Haida and her calf, Kyuquot, were shipping to San Antonio. But this would not be the only time Tilikum would kill. Eight years after Keltieaposs horrying death Daniel Dukes was found dead on the orcaaposs back while he was in his sleeping pool. The -year-old had visited SeaWorld earlier that day and managed to avoid security cameras to stay until after dark. He got into Tilikumaposs tank, naked, and when his body was found the following morning, he was covered in cuts and bruises. An inquest ruled he had drowned. Then, SeaWorld trainer, Dawn Brancheau was killed in front of thousands of spectators at the attraction in Orlando, Florida, by the male orca on February , . Dawn, who had achieved her goal of becoming a senior trainer at Seaworld at the time of her tragic death, had studied psychology and animal behaviours at university. When she graduated, she spent two years working with dolphins at an attraction in New Jersey before landing her job at Seaworld. Two years after Dawn started work at Seaworld, she became a killer whale trainer. She made sure she was as fit and healthy as possible so she could manage to rigours of swimming with the huge beasts from the deep. Dawn was one of the star trainers at Seaworld - she was key to the killer whale shows and her face was seen on billboards advertising the park. Chillingly, four years before her tragic death,  years ago today, Dawn had spoken out about the dangers of working with orcas. She had a special relationship with the huge killer whale, Tilikum, also known as Blackfish. He was one of the largest orcas at SeaWorld and he had been in captivity for more than  years. Those who worked with her said their bond was strong and based on love and trust. John Hargrove, who was a senior trainer at Seaworld at the time of Dawnaposs death, said: We’ll never know why Tilikum made that choice to grab Dawn and pull her into the pool. He had a great relationship with her, and she had a great relationship with him. I do believe that he loved her, and I know that she loved him. It was after one of the Dine With Shamu shows that Tilikum carried out his brutal act. Tourists could watch the action as they ate and Dawn had climbed out of the pool. She was lying with her face next to Tilikumaposs - the orca she had spent countless hours with and who had always treated her as a trusted companion. Suddenly, Dawn was dragged into the water. Initially it was claimed she had been pulled into the pool by her ponytail, but there were later suggestions Tilikum had grabbed her by her shoulder. What came next was truly gruesome. Tilikum didnapost just kill his trainer, the attack was prolonged and incredibly violent. Dawn, , was not only drowned, her left arm was torn from its socket, Dawn was scalped with her hair and skin found at the bottom of the pool. Horrically, her spinal cord was severed, while she also suffered from broken ribs, a broken jaw and a post-mortem revealed she died from both drowning and blunt force injury. Chillingly, the captive whale killed his trainer and then refused to release her body. For  minutes, he kept Dawnaposs broken body on the pool with him, despite attempts from the other trainers to distract him with nets and food. Eventually, they managed to get him into a smaller, medical pool, where he was easier to calm and he finally released the body of the trainer who had spent so much time with him. Following Dawnaposs death, Tilikum was sent to spend most of his days in a pool rarely seen by the public. There are reports that he would spend hours on end just lying on the surface of the water. Tilikum died at the Florida attraction in January . Six years after Dawnaposs death SeaWorld announced they would end their programme of breeding the orcas in captivity.

The booze soaked animal, known as Kalua, set off on his trail of destruction when his owner died. The oculist had fed the pet hard liquor at home in Marzapur in the Indian region Uttar Pradesh. Upon his death the alcohol supply the monkey was reliant on ran dry, prompting him to take to the streets in a blind fury. The animal indiscriminately attacked humans as he passed them, making a particular bee-line for young girls. Numerous children were left needing plastic surgery after Kalua ripped at their faces with his fangs. According to Patrika one of his victims died. Zoo doctor Mohd Nasir told the publication how the monkey had been captured by keepers who injected him with sedatives. He was placed in isolation following the biting spree.

Forecasters say temperatures are on the rise as we move through the weekend and into next week - with low pressure being replaced by sizzling European air moving in from the south. However, parts of the UK, especially the north west, could continue to see showers across the weekend before high temperatures next week. Met Office forecaster Alex Deakin said: Over the weekend we replace this humid air at the moment causing thunder, with another area of low pressure bringing in fresher conditions. There are signs into next week of drier, sunnier weather and perhaps warmer - specically in parts of the south. The north west is likely to remain more unsettled. We have low pressure nearby at the moment, winds are light so thunderstorms being creates are slow moving and thataposs why they are dropping a lot of rain. As we go over the next few days that is replaced by another area of low pressure - but that is coming in from the Atlantic and has very dferent characteristics. It will bring in fresher air and the winds will be stronger. After a mixture of conditions this weekend, Alex said next week could see a big change - specically for those in the south east.He added: A switch of wind direction means is pretty good news for the east coast. We switch to south westerly winds meaning eastern areas have an offshore wind so it turns much brighter and warmer. Beyond that, although low pressure is sticking nearby, it looks like it will hang out in the north west and higher pressure will move in. In the south and east high pressure means drier and sunnier weather - and it could warm up as well. European charts suggesting there is some really warm air nearby that could allow for some it to waft up across parts of the south. Some parts of the UK hit by a deluge of rain saw flooding after low pressure fronts brought stormy conditions. Hundreds of homes were flooded yesterday – some for a third time this year. Emergency services pumped water out of houses in Pentre, Wales, a village flooded twice when Storm Dennis hit in February. Yellow thunderstorm warnings were in place for London, southern England and parts of south Wales. Ryan Shelton posted footage of a submerged street in Ilkeston, Derbys, and said the flooding was “worse than ever”. The -year-old said it was “quite scary” how  minutes of rain left .m of floodwater.

Players pick up on that.“Having Gordon Strachan and Jimmy Nicholl’s experience is fantastic as well.“We might have our playing experience but they have  years more experience in the game than any of us. That’s invaluable.”Irvine and Mackay work closely together at Dundee – but it’s not the first time they have worked together.Dee first team coach, Mackay, was brought to St Johnstone by Derek McInnes while Irvine was the Perth side’s first choice right back.In the end, Mackay went on to be come a club legend at McDiarmid, while Irvine moved on to Dundee.But there are no hard feelings from Irvine, who has loved every minute of his time at Dens Park.He said: “Dave Mackay came in from Livingston in [St Johnstone’s] first season in the SPL to add competition for places. I was unfortunate because I’d chosen to have surgery to tidy up an ankle problem that had niggled me.“The plan was that would tie in with the close season and I could start pre-season.“But it hindered me and I was behind with my fitness and struggled a bit to get back to form.“Dave, obviously, came in and did well and I think him being able to play in a few positions helped him, too.“I recognised at that time, being in my mid-s I wanted to be playing every week and I wouldn’t get that at St Johnstone.“I’ve nothing against Del, that’s the decisions that have to be made to win games – when Dave came in, the manager couldn’t guarantee me games and I heard there was interest from Dundee.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

A great team goal from one end to a goal in five touches.Derek McKay skins the full-back, what a pass toForrest, who shoots, goalkeeper parries and McKay scores.#Steve has summed up the goal perfectly, although it must be said the #full-back# McKay left in his wake during the break forward before playing in Forrest was Hoops legend Tommy Gemmell, while McKay#s finish # which put the Reds - up on the day # was also notable for being the th Scottish Cup goal scored by the Dandy Dons.More than , people packed into Hampden for the national trophy showpiece in  # one of the most famous days in Dons history. It is quite right for one of McKay#s goals, which completed a fairytale cup run for the late attacker, to be among the candidates for Aberdeen#s best ever goal.Speaking to the Evening Express in , McKay said: #Celtic kept pounding us, but we knew the cup was coming to Aberdeen when I made it - inside the last  minutes.#I back-heeled the ball over Tommy Gemmell’s head at the half-way line and raced away with it before passing to Jim Forrest, but his shot got blocked.#I was the first to reach the rebound and blasted the ball into the Celtic net.#Win a   Aberdeen kids kit and £ Smyths voucher in our Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal competition\" title\"#Win a   Aberdeen kids kit and £ Smyths voucher in our Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal competition# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp sport football aberdeen-fc donsnews help-us-find-the-best-strike-ever-from-a-dandy-don embed # secretzPdlfpkOE\" data-secret\"zPdlfpkOE\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"We want youngsters to have a go at imitating our Aberdeen#s Greatest Goal contenders, with the club agreeing to give away a kids# home kit and kids# away kit for the two best efforts as chosen by our  of judges.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer. Why was this not nipped in the bud  Is there an ongoing lack of management training and support Whatever the reasons, it has to stop now.Minard folk were surprised to find themselves in the papers, on television and on the radio this week.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side. It shows contempt for all of us who have stuck by the rules to protect our lives and the lives of others.Boris Johnson has asked us to #move on# but this issue will not go away.

This can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.Before putting it on, you should wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and do the same after removing it.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store any used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose.Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched and wash the covering regularly. The covering can be washed with other laundry, using your normal detergent.When wearing a face covering, take care to tuck away any loose ends.How do I stop my glasses from steaming up If you wear glasses, wearing a face mask at the same time can cause the lenses to steam up, making it dficult to see properly.But the common problem has an easy solution, thanks to advice from doctors in the medical journal Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.To prevent the issue, doctors advise washing your glasses with soapy water before putting the mask on, and rinsing them under warm water.Then, gently dry off the lenses with a clean towel or cloth before putting them back on.Washing the lenses with soapy water leaves behind a ldquothin surfactant film that reduces misting on the lenses, meaning they now shouldnrsquot steam up when a face mask is worn.Should face coverings be worn where The current government advice states that face coverings should be worn in enclosed spaces, which includes some shops and public transport.At the moment, people are not being told to wear them outdoors, while exercising, or in schools or offices.Several airlines, including easyJet and Ryanair, have introduced a requirement for passengers to wear face masks on board.However, the government believes that face masks should be reserved for people who need them to protect against risks in their workplace, such as health and care workers."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-priest-moving-rome-new-job","story":"A BORDERS priest has accepted a high-ranking job in Rome.Nick Welsh, , has been based in Galashiels for the past two years.But he will soon be flying out to Italy after being picked for the role of vice-rector at the Scots College, where aspiring Scottish priests receive their training.Father Nick, originally from Stirling, told the Border he had ldquomixed emotions when he heard the news.He said: ldquoIrsquom quite excited, but Irsquoll have a bit of a heavy heart when I leave ndash I was just getting used to the Borders.Since , Father Nick has been administrator of the Parish of Our Lady  St Andrew, which has churches in Galashiels, Melrose and Selkirk.He said: ldquoI was really warmly welcomed here.

What a shame, then, about the second thing I couldnrsquot help noticing: how drab and disappointing George Square remains.Granted, the grim sight of loyalist protesters wrapped in Union flags ldquoprotecting the statues and Cenotaph didnrsquot help. But even without their isive presence the cityrsquos historic square is a let-down, visually, socially and culturally, a frustrating waste of urban space that could and should be far better utilised.Where other European squares create buzz and atmosphere with year-round arts, culture, food and shopping attracting locals and visitors, George Square is dreary and uninspiring: a few trees, some benches and a clutch of dull, predictable th-century statues ndash ldquogreat men and Queen Victoria ndash that few feel any kinship with. The only part of the square that has any real purpose and meaning is the Cenotaph.The idea that George Square is in serious need of a makeover is nothing new, of course, and there have been ious  dawns and broken promises over the years, not least the outrageous fiasco of  ndash remember that  ndash which wasted huge amounts of public money and goodwill alike. But the two defining events of  - coronavirus and the Black Lives Matter protests -offer Glasgow the best opportunity in a generation to finally get this right and transform George Square into the vibrant civic centre Glaswegians deserve.Letrsquos start with the pandemic, which will continue to damage the economic and social pull of town and city centres. As lockdown restrictions are gradually lted we will grasp a new reality ndash fewer shops, restaurants, bars and cultural attractions than before, with those that do re-open unable to work at full capacity for now. Answers to the sort of questions around attracting people to city centres that were already stumping businesses, planners and local authorities even before coronavirus hit have become all the more pressing.Thatrsquos where a proper revamp of George Square comes in, a key step forward in boosting Glasgowrsquos economy and cultural capital in the wake of the pandemic. What should the square contain  That would be for citizens to decide, but herersquos a few quick ideas that presume an eventual end to social distancing: an ampitheatre for live music, theatre and comedy, proper seating, pop-up pods for community groups, a food and craft market, arts and exhibition space, murals, a garden and childrenrsquos play area.As for the fate of the statues, again, it would be for the people to decide whether they still have a place in this new urban realm. Not that we would want to forget our past, of course.

But in Scotland, thanks to Covid it could be within sight. Schoolrsquos out, not just for summer but for the foreseeable future.At least that was the educational prognosis from the Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, at the weekend. He announced a new ldquoblended learning, which sounds like something to do with tea, but is a euphemism for Scottish children spending most of the school week at home.:Opinion: Brian Beacom: Why I am edging slowly towards the pro-independence point of viewParents in Edinburgh were told that, when schools go back on August , theyrsquoll be lucky to see their children getting face-to-face teaching for a third of the time. Many Scottish pupils might only get one day a week. This is not so much blended as half-baked.Mr Swinney also endorsed the view of Larry Flanagan, general-secretary of the teachers union the EIS, that next yearrsquos exam diet should be cancelled, like this yearrsquos. Few in the education establishment much like competitive exams at the best of time, so it might seem unsurprising that they have been dropped ndash for the first time since .Parents, who donrsquot seem to have been consulted by Mr Swinneyrsquos misnamed Education Recovery Group, are furious. They see this as an abdication of responsibility by bureaucrats who care nothing about educational attainment and are putting the interests of their own client groups above the welfare of children.Parents in Edinburgh formed an instant pressure group,  , to demand proper, face-to-face education at least  per cent of the week. Sarah Chisnall says they also want serious benchmarked online learning for the other part of the ldquoblended learning experience, with a regular amount of teacher face time.Three months into school lockdown, it is surely a scandal that nothing of the like has been done. Home schooling is practically non-existent in many areas, according to parents, with some children having no contact with anything remotely resembling an actual teacher on line. Google, FIFA  and Instagram are poor substitutes.A UK-wide study from University College London confirmed yesterday that two million children across Britain have done little or no schoolwork at home during the lockdown. Four million have not had regular contact with a teacher and six million have not ed their most recent assignment.Nicola Sturgeon, who recognises a political disaster when she sees one, leaped in to try to undo the damage done by her deputy. ldquoIt is absolutely not the case that we are planning on blended learning to last a year or anything like it, she said on Monday, giving no guarantees that it wonrsquot.The First Minister promised that face-to face-teaching will happen ldquoas soon as possible. Exams will go ahead ndash well maybe ndash and she hinted that the two-metre rule in social distancing might be relaxed in schools.ldquoDelusional. said the SNPrsquos sometime coalition partners, the Scottish Greens, which has a lot of teachers amongst its membership. Like Larry Flanagan of the EIS they think next yearrsquos exams should be cancelled because there is no safe way of preparing children for them.Tell that to the parents. We know that the risk to children is vanishingly small. To prevent pupils spreading the disease to teachers and parents, schools could use masks, hand sanitisers, ldquobubble cohorts, and perspex screens.It is not aschildren arenrsquot associating already out of school. The extra transmission risk from a deep-cleaned environment like a school must surely be negligible. The risks of not going to school ndash mental health, obesity, domestic abuse and the like ndash are almost certainly greater than the risk of Covid.:Coronavirus: Push to prescribe vitamin D to people at highest risk from Covid in bid to curb second wave of virusParents say, rightly, that the two metre rule is not enforced in hospitals. It manestly isnrsquot in supermarkets, parks and public transport either. So why is this bureaucratic red line being applied in schools Why is the education of their children not a priority, they say  With classes and schools only able to handle a third of children, the obvious answer is to increase the number of classrooms and the number of teachers.Break out of the school precincts and start deploying unused venues like cinemas and churches, even marquees. Bring in supply teachers and retired teachers to bump up the numbers.It would of course mean more than the pound million or so in additional funding the Government is currently offering the local authorities. But the Scottish education and skills budget is more than pound. billion. Surely some of that could be reallocated, as was the case in the NHS when they set up ldquopop-up hospitals like the Louisa Jordan.At any rate, Nicola Sturgeon now has a major fight on her hands. The EIS says, correctly, that the two-metre rule is still what the Governmentrsquos scientic advisers say is necessary to prevent a second wave of Covid-. They are not going to sht on that, eventhe World Health Organisation has been talking about reducing it to one metre.There are two million parents out there and only , teachers. Ms Sturgeon can do her political arithmetic. She is going to have to spray some serious cash to get the schools back on any kind of ing basis.Scottish teachers got a  per cent pay hike from the Government last year. I suspect Mr Swinney is going to have to loosen the purse strings again to prevent the deschooling of a generation of Scottish children.The late Ivan Illich, whose thinking influenced the Curriculum for Excellence, envisaged children teaching themselves, using technology, even though he was writing before the internet existed.

Many will have been longing to get back into their place of worship, but will now be worried they are not entirely welcome. It doesnrsquot get much more hurtful than that.As well as being harsh, the Kirkrsquos attitude is also short-sighted. Dwindling as its resources are, it relies heavily on bequests. For some parishioners, as they approach old age it is important to know they will continue to contribute to the Church of Scotlandrsquos work, long after they have gone.

New Zealand has achieved much the same with Covid: it had had no new cases at all for  days, until two UK visitors tested positive this week.The lower the prevalence of the virus within the population, the easier it is to pinpoint and contain new clusters, prevent a second wave and allow a fullerto normalityalbeit at a later date.Whatever our progress, Scotland recorded  new cases between May  and June , so eradication is still elusive.: Why the science has no clear-cut answers to Scotlands two-metre dilemmaIn this context, the decision not to re-open beer gardens is all about a better result later: for example, reducing virus prevalence enough that physical distancing can be halved to one metre in time for the hospitality traderesuming on July .Ms Sturgeon said there is emerging evidence that pubs, restaurants and gyms are \"hotspots for transmission\". Japanese research found that the risk of infection is around  times higher indoors than outdoors.So why is it safe to open outdoor food markets but not beer gardens  One theory is that people in beer gardens spend a prolonged period in same company, increasing the risk of transmissionsomeone in the group is infected but not yet showing symptoms.They are also more likely to talk loudly, shout, or even singwhich is also linked to transmission.

However, tidal and wave action continued to drive erosion under the tree roots and actually encouraged erosion.ldquoThese days, the awareness and understanding of the cycles that sand dunes go through ndash and their value as habitats in their own right ndash is much more prevalent so we are looking at how best we can restore sand dunes to their natural state.Sand dunes help to protect the coastline and are likely to be an increasingly important defence against sea level rise as a result of the Climate Emergency.Natural and healthy dune systems change their formation in response to wave, wind and tidal action, with some sand removed only to then be replaced at a later stage with deposits of new sand.This self-sustaining process can play out in the course of one storm but more often occurs over many years and,viewed at a particular moment in the cycle, could give the impression that the dunes are disappearing.Tree planting in previous generations attempted to stop this apparent erosion and fix the dunes in place ndash but it also interrupted the natural process of replenishment, as well as the colonisation of dune vegetation.Ms Dolby said: ldquoPrevious restoration attempts over the last  years have failed to properly restore open dunes because they did not deal with a surface layer on the dunes that had been enriched by fallen leaves or needles, conditions which favour woodland plants and that effectively prevented more sensitive dune plants from surviving.ldquoThe method wersquore trialling now involves removing the trees and scrub and scraping and burying the plant litter layer to leave a bare sand surface, which will hopefully support the rare vegetation special to these dunes.The trial site, at Morrich More, will be closely monitored over the next five years to assess the effectiveness of the restoration process.Scotlandrsquos more than , hectares of sand dune systems are considered among some of the countryrsquos most valuable habitats, thought to support more than  rare species.Risks to the dunes include coner plantations which have already claimed around , hectares and sea buckthorn which has colonised signicant areas of sand dune in parts of south-east Scotland.

For we are most of all resilient.And, at this time of year City of Glasgow College staff and students would normally celebrate the formal graduation of some  maritime officer cadets and ratings at a packed ceremony in Glasgow Cathedral.As the UKrsquos premier maritime college, we are responsible for training one third of all UK Merchant Marine Officers. Our college is very much the lsquoPride of the Fleetrsquo, providing the maritime industry with its next generation of competent, safe seafarers.Our Cadet Officers leave us work ready with the necessary skills, knowledge and indeed attitude to move from shore to ship.This June, it is most certainly unfortunate that social distancing rules prohibit us from coming together to mark this extremely important time in our academic calendar.I will especially miss seeing the shared joy in the faces of family and friends and being able to personally congratulate each and every one of our students. However, what is vital is that they are leaving with fresh talent, finely honed skills and a professionalism second to none.Indeed, they leave to work in an industry which is now rightly being recognised, in these extremely challenging times, as highly essential in keeping our vital supplies running.Our status as an island nation has become more apparent during this pandemic, reliant as we are on our sea lines of communication to maintain our economy.These students are following in a great maritime tradition, not only of this city but of the UK.Without the Merchant Navy,  per cent of all our food and other goods would not reach ports or shops, both here and across the world.So, as well as being first class seafarers, our Class of  are also joining that elite band we now acknowledge as key workers.This is a time when much relies on future generations of skilled workers to help get us back on our feet, and those that graduate in this pandemic year and beyond, are the future generations we now look to.As founding Principal of Scotlandrsquos largest college, I have no doubt of the skills-led recovery we need, nor of the essential nature of that response: a coherent, connected, collaborative effort from Scotlandrsquos tertiary education sector, with colleges at its heart.We are connected directly to the communities we serve, able to help people upskill and reskill, getting them and their families back on track.I look forward to celebrating, perhaps later this year, with the Class of  listed here and many more.For now, my congratulations go to each and every student on achieving their well-deserved and internationally recognised qualications.They can hold their heads high, and I continue to be as proud as ever of our sector and the incredible role it plays in developing and shaping peoplersquos lives while operating in an increasingly turbulent, and constantly changing, world.Together we stand tall.

Employers should support their workers in using face coverings safely and provide advice,requested, on applying and removing the covering.On ferry services face coverings must also be worn by passengers and staff unless the ferry, or part of the ferry which is open to members of the public, is entirely outdoors or physical distancing of two metres can be maintained.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson stressed the importance of the new rules and that by wearing a face covering everyone is engaged in a collective responsibility to reduce the risk of transmission.He said: “Our message remains clear that public transport should be for key workers and those who need it most and can’t walk or cycle to work.#Capacity is reduced to enable physical distancing and operators are not yet running full services. However, as we work towards recovery and more peopleto work and further local leisure opportunities begin to open up it is vital that measures are put in place to protect everyone’s health.“Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing. Wearing a face covering while on public transport means you are playing your part in the collective effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus and reducing the risk to your fellow citizens. These measures complement physical distancing and good hand hygiene, they do not replace them.”Advice on face coverings, including how to make one and instructions for using one, will be available on the Transport Scotland website. This advice is being updated to include full details of the applicable exemptions.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available.Source: Her Majesty’s TreasuryAn unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff.Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced.It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to £, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October.Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.”He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.”Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff.“The workshop’s a big, wide open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.”Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic. Getting through the next few months is crucial for us. We have a really good bunch of people and we want to hang on to them. The furlough scheme has helped us to do that.” vw, px\"  Planning, forward thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China.Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had.“The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown.“Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base.Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online.“All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes.Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank.“That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.”Shnuggle also received a £, Small Business Grant.Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy.“So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving.” vw, px\"  Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.

The two metre social distancing rule will affect passenger capacity for our ferries – and we also continue to experience issues around the availability of staff and the effect that has on opportunities around timetabling.“I would assure our isles residents that we continue to bring these issues and challenges to the attention of the Scottish Government and will do all we can to maximise sailingsnecessary, taking on board the views of our isles residents throughout.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication. If a customer is concerned about the identity of a caller to their home they can call the PSNI ‘Quick Check’ service on .

Victor Leonard, chairman of the international youth football competition at which Rashford was twice a winner with Manchester United, has always been impressed with the manner in which the young England international striker has handled himself. As Rashford vowed to continue helping those in need after successfully forcing the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, Mr. Leonard described the footballer as an inspiration to everyone. He added: “We first came across Marcus in the Manchester United squads that came across to Northern Ireland to compete in our tournaments. “He was a smash hit as United went on to win the Premier section in  and  but you could not help but admire the way, even at a young age, Marcus conducted himself. “We have been across to United many times and it was always very clear how highly regarded he was as a player and a person.” Rashford came off the bench in United’s  final victory over County Tyrone at Ballymena Showgrounds and started when the Red Devils triumphed  months later against defending champions Vendee from France. Victor added: “I think he is an inspiration to everyone. He has been so passionate about this issue but gone about attempting to bring change in a highly commendable manner. “He is a credit to his family and his club and we at STATSports SuperCupNI are privileged that he is one of our tournament graduates who has gone on to achieve greatness in his football career and also through his campaigning for something in which he believes so fervently. “Hopefully he will continue to be an inspiration to all of us.” Rashford has raised about poundm to supply around three million meals to vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. In an emotional open letter to MPs, Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. He said his story was all too familiar for families in England.

Mark Hamiliton, who is a member of Ash, and his dad, Neil, started the project a year ago and since then the customised bangles have been snapped up by fans. The father and son team have now raised £, for the charity, which has had to suspend many of its services for local cancer patients and their families, and has furloughed most staff due to the coronavirus pandemic.The charity has also had to postpone its fundraising events, so donations are even more vital during the current crisis. The latest batch of bracelets are from guitar and bass strings played during Ash#s recent European tour, which was cancelled half-way through. Over the last year, Mark#s dad has made hundreds of bangles as souvenirs from a host of the band#s concerts played all over the world. Mark, who said he hopes to be back on tour once the pandemic is over, said: Thanks so much to all the Ash and Snow Patrol fans who have supported our #RockBangle project for Cancer Focus NI. So far we have raised around £, and hope to sell more bracelets once our tour recommences, whenever that may be. Big gratitude also to dad, who#s worked so hard on making these bangles in his wee shed, and Happy Father#s Day to him from my lockdown home in Northumberland.Mark donated the proceeds of the bracelets to Cancer Focus NI because of his mum, Miriam, who has now thankfully survived cancer three times. Miriam has received great support from Cancer Focus NI over the years. She is also one of the founder members of the charity#s support group in Downpatrick, helping other women who#ve been diagnosed with cancer. Mark, who sells the bangles on his social media channels, explained that making the bracelets is a team effort. I weave and cut the strings to size and my dad solders the joints together, making what was an ugly joint into something that resembles a metal pearl, he explained. They look nice, but raw and rustic. I want them to retain a bit of that rock #n# roll aesthetic. Rosie Forsythe, from Cancer Focus NI, said: We can#t thank Mark and his dad enough for all their hard work and generosity. Cancer Focus NI relies on donations for over % of our income.

There will be ato travel and we are anticipating being operational again this summer.I think there will be pent-up demand and lots of families haven#t seen each other - there have been birthdays missed, grandchildren arriving, and celebrations.She said we are going to have to get used to wearing masks on board flights, as well as taking the other precautions in a bid to curb any further spread of the virus.Ms McKeever was speaking on the latest edition of the Ulster Business podcast, along with Londonderry Chamber of Commerce boss Paul Clancy, about what impact the Covid- crisis has had on the north west.We are one of those businesses which did close, she said.That week between March  and  was just a colossal shock to all sorts of businesses.We were a bit of a canary in the mine because we could see we were going to cease business in a matter of days, so we are, and have been, one of those businesses which have been completely closed and staff on furlough.Mr Clancy said while many businesses in Derry were ahead of the curve and prepared for lockdown, it was a huge shock.He said reopening will be focused around getting as much money spent in the local economy as possible, and while some firms may not survive there are opportunities, including creating employment following the announcement of the new proposed medical school, and increased demand for PPE.You can hear the podcast at www.ulsterbusinessBelfast Most ReadNorthern Ireland#s most popular property listings as market reopens after lockdownCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Hairdressers to reopen, shielding to be paused and social distancing at schools reduced to mDerry man Conor McColgan killed alongside girlfriend in horror crashCoronavirus: MLA Bradshaw says reason for small cluster outbreak in NI #should be made public#Man killed after climbing accident at Co Antrim clfs,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I haven#t felt as sad since  and I#m going to take a while to get over it.These men are out there protecting us and it#s a very sad thing that they can#t go about their duties, this is how they are rewarded.Local TD Denis Naughten said he was absolutely shocked and saddened to hear of the tragedy.He said at age , Det-Gda Horkan would have been only a child when the two gardaí were killed. He may not have been old enough to remember it but all of the community would remember their tragic deaths.This brings all of that back, particularly to the community in west Roscommon and around Castlerea. It adds to the tragedy.Daylight brought floods of tributes from all corners of Ireland and beyond.From the Taoiseach, President and colleagues of the fallen garda.There were more local tributes too, including one from Charlestown Sarsfields GAA club, where Det-Gda Horkan had earned the nickname #The Bear#.What we have here is a random act, a violent act, that led to the death of Det-Gda Horkan, so it is tragic and it is an attack upon us all. Garda Commissioner Drew HarrisGarda Commissioner Drew Harris visited the town and described the brutal killing of Det-Gda Horkan as a random act.Colm served the communities he worked in with distinction and pride during his  years as a member of An Garda Síochána, said Mr Harris.Detective Garda Colm Horkan is the th member of An Garda Síochána killed in the line of duty. Today is a terrible reminder of the signicant sacrices, including the ultimate sacrice, that gardaí make to keep people safe.Speaking to reporters in Castlerea yesterday afternoon, he said there was no sense that the death was linked to organised crime, saying it was a random act.As we know in this time, this was in effect a conversation between Det-Gda Horkan and a member of the public, he said.There was then an altercation during which the service pistol which Gda Horkan was carrying was then used against him and he was shot and fatally wounded.He received very prompt and professional medical attention but to no avail and died from his injuries.Mr Harris said that Det-Gda Horkan#s death was an attack upon society.I can certainly say at this moment in time there is no sense of a bigger picture, organised crime or subversive, he said.What we have here is a random act, a violent act, that led to the death of Det-Gda Horkan, so it is tragic and it is an attack upon us all.It is correct to say that it#s an attack upon society, he added.The commissioner appealed to the public to help with the investigation as there is a video of the attack circulating social media.Colm gave his le protecting the community he had served with distinction and courage. Taoiseach Leo VaradkarHe urged anyone who was in Castlerea Town Centre on Wednesday night at pm-.am to come forwardthey have information.Far from Castlerea, on the steps of Government Buildings, the shooting of a serving garda brought pause to a political week dominated by government formation talks.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar praised Det-Gda Horkan for the courage and sacrice he showed during his more than two decades serving with An Garda Síochána.Mr Varadkar offered his condolence and support to Det-Gda Horkan#s family.Colm gave his le protecting the community he had served with distinction and courage during his  years as a member of An Garda Síochána, he said. His story is the same as the thousands of men and women who wear the unorm. A story of courage, sacrice and service.Our gardaí are our s of the peace and defenders of the rule of law, he said. They are role models.This tragedy is a heart-wrenching reminder of how much we owe our gardaí for the work they do all over the country.They protect and serve our citizens, our communities and our country, every day putting themselves on the front line of crime prevention on behalf of all of us, he added.Meanwhile, in the second largest town in Co Roscommon, disbelief was being replaced by grief.Up to  people gathered in the town centre last night for a vigil in Det-Gda Horkan#s memory.A small green marquee was set up in the Fairgreen in the Main Street and tributes were led by local Fianna Fáil Councillor Paschal Fitzmaurice and parish priest Fr McManus.Heavy rain lashed down as the small town mourned the passing of the garda.The terrible sad occasion that happened here last night is a tragedy that I suppose we will never, ever forget, said Mr Fitzmaurice.District Officer Superintendent Goretti Sheridan also paid tributes to a friend and colleague. I want to thank everyone for coming this evening, it means a lot to us.We#re obviously devastated at the death of our friend and colleague Colm, she said.Fr McManus said that the community had particularly felt the blow of the now three losses because they were very much a part of the community and widely respected in the Roscommon town.Our prayers and thoughts are very much with his family, relatives and his colleagues here in Castlerea, and gardaí everywhere, he said.Additional reporting by Gabija Gataveckaite, Conor Feehan and Tom Brady.

Publicans in Derry who took a ‘massive’ financial hit by closing ahead of St Patrick’s Day in the interest of public safety have encouraged the public to ‘support their local’ once they reopen. Northern Irelands hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes can reopen from July . William McGuinness and his business partner Phil Nolan own Paedar O’Donnells, The Gweedore and Fty Seven nightclub on Waterloo Street. Before the government issued any formal directive for businesses to shut, Paedar’s led the way by announcing that it was closing its doors on March . googletag.cmd.push It came two days before the busiest date on the calendar for Irish bars, St Patrick’s Day. “It was a matter of conscience for us,” Mr McGuinness said, “the general feeling at the time was that the NHS was going to be under pressure and we thought St Patrick’s Day would have been a petri dish for infection and we didn’t want to be responsible for that.” Boris Johnson’s order for all non-essential businesses would come over a week later on March . Derry City and Strabane has the second lowest COVID- death rate of every council area in the country and just  positive Coronavirus cases to date – also the second lowest in the country. googletag.cmd.push Chair of the British Medical Association in NI, Derry doctor Tom Black, has credited the part played by local businesses who took their cues from the Republic of Ireland. Mr McGuinness said they’re happy they made that decision even though the business took a ‘massive hit’ because of it. “St Patrick’s Day is our busiest day of the year and we were thinking about retirement soon but this thing has thrown it all up in the air. “We knew that, but we were just concerned about the health of Derry people.” Paedar’s missed out on grants because it didn’t meet the criteria but employees were furloughed. The rebuild will be a slow process, Mr McGuinness said, as the pandemic took its toll. DIFFICULT From July  pubs and bars will be allowed to trade but must serve food and operate on a table service basis. Pubs that do not serve food will be allowed to sell alcohol outdoors, such as beer gardens, also restricted to table service. Mr McGuinness said that will make it ‘very dficult’ for small bars like Paedar’s with limited outdoor space. Permission to use that space is absolutely essential in his view. He added: “I would object to the fact that restaurant bars are allowed to open but bars aren’t allowed to serve inside. “I think the risk is higher in a restaurant bar with adults and children being served food and drink whereas we’re just serving alcohol to adults. “With food there are all sorts of utensils but we just have glasses and disposable plastic. “I don’t see the sense in holding us up because we don’t do food.” The ‘rush’ is now on to ready the bar for customers and bar owners like Mr McGuinness are looking to the government and local authorities for guidance. Paedar O’Donnell’s has been cleared of tables and chairs to allow for the walls to be freshly painted and floors nished ahead of the grand reopening.  Mr McGuinness hopes that the government advice is relaxed to allow bars to serve indoors. They’re awaiting further guidance before spending any money on Perspex screens or other safety measures. He concluded: “We’d encourage people to come back but it’s going to be very limited space. “We don’t have the tourists, we were a very busy bar at weekends, and we’re not going to get those numbers in – nowhere is – because Derry people like to go out on a Friday and Saturday and nowhere will be able to cater for them because of social distancing. “There’s no money to be made in the next few months that’s the reality. “But hopefully over timeit is under control and there’s no resurgence maybe we can get back to some normality.” INFORMATION The owner of numerous bar-restaurants in the city including the Bentley, The Magnet and Molly Malones, Tony O’Connor, is also seeking clarity. “I’m surmising that they’re working on it at Stormont but we need more information about social distancing and so on,” he said. With all of his restaurants serving food he’s assured by the fact that customers can sit indoors but is unsure as to whether dining customers can stay longer to socialise. Mr O Connor said: “Every one of our premises will be opening on July  because of the food situation. Out of our six bars, five of them have outdoor areas.” This week he held a meeting with management and they’re ‘all positive and raring to go’. Like many businesses, the pandemic has been a ‘nightmare’ for Mr O’Connor but he realises that everybody is on the same boat. The Irish government ‘deserves a massive pat on the back’ for closing bars before St Patrick’s Day, he said, because ‘you would have had thousands and thousands across Ireland’ spreading the virus. “A lot of bars lost out on revenue there, no money was coming in and none getting paid out, so you just start over again,” he added. AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mr McGuinness said they’re happy they made that decision even though the business took a ‘massive hit’ because of it. “St Patrick’s Day is our busiest day of the year and we were thinking about retirement soon but this thing has thrown it all up in the air. “We knew that, but we were just concerned about the health of Derry people.” Paedar’s missed out on grants because it didn’t meet the criteria but employees were furloughed. The rebuild will be a slow process, Mr McGuinness said, as the pandemic took its toll. DIFFICULT From July  pubs and bars will be allowed to trade but must serve food and operate on a table service basis. Pubs that do not serve food will be allowed to sell alcohol outdoors, such as beer gardens, also restricted to table service. Mr McGuinness said that will make it ‘very dficult’ for small bars like Paedar’s with limited outdoor space. Permission to use that space is absolutely essential in his view. He added: “I would object to the fact that restaurant bars are allowed to open but bars aren’t allowed to serve inside. “I think the risk is higher in a restaurant bar with adults and children being served food and drink whereas we’re just serving alcohol to adults. “With food there are all sorts of utensils but we just have glasses and disposable plastic. “I don’t see the sense in holding us up because we don’t do food.” The ‘rush’ is now on to ready the bar for customers and bar owners like Mr McGuinness are looking to the government and local authorities for guidance. Paedar O’Donnell’s has been cleared of tables and chairs to allow for the walls to be freshly painted and floors nished ahead of the grand reopening.  Mr McGuinness hopes that the government advice is relaxed to allow bars to serve indoors. They’re awaiting further guidance before spending any money on Perspex screens or other safety measures. He concluded: “We’d encourage people to come back but it’s going to be very limited space. “We don’t have the tourists, we were a very busy bar at weekends, and we’re not going to get those numbers in – nowhere is – because Derry people like to go out on a Friday and Saturday and nowhere will be able to cater for them because of social distancing. “There’s no money to be made in the next few months that’s the reality. “But hopefully over timeit is under control and there’s no resurgence maybe we can get back to some normality.” INFORMATION The owner of numerous bar-restaurants in the city including the Bentley, The Magnet and Molly Malones, Tony O’Connor, is also seeking clarity. “I’m surmising that they’re working on it at Stormont but we need more information about social distancing and so on,” he said. With all of his restaurants serving food he’s assured by the fact that customers can sit indoors but is unsure as to whether dining customers can stay longer to socialise. Mr O Connor said: “Every one of our premises will be opening on July  because of the food situation. Out of our six bars, five of them have outdoor areas.” This week he held a meeting with management and they’re ‘all positive and raring to go’. Like many businesses, the pandemic has been a ‘nightmare’ for Mr O’Connor but he realises that everybody is on the same boat. The Irish government ‘deserves a massive pat on the back’ for closing bars before St Patrick’s Day, he said, because ‘you would have had thousands and thousands across Ireland’ spreading the virus. “A lot of bars lost out on revenue there, no money was coming in and none getting paid out, so you just start over again,” he added. AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It comes after First Minister Arlene Foster told a Stormont sitting on Tuesday that she ‘does not intend to make any announcement about the date of first intake until all the necessary preparation work has been completed’. Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, Sinn Feacutein MLA Karen Mullan reiterated the point that students will enrol next year. Karen Mullan said the announcement by Michelle O’Neill on May  was made ‘on behalf of the Executive’ which involves the five main parties. googletag.cmd.push That was needed to allow Ulster University to move on to the next stage of the General Medical Councilaccreditation process. She added: “I know people may feel frustratedthere is no commitment in terms of dates and movement but there are no concerns at this stage on our part that the work isn’t being done. “That’s not to say it hasn’t been dficult but there are no concerns from the university either, they have everything they need to progress through the GMC stage. “And even when we get to the next point on this journey when we will have applications out there is so much work, it is a long-term project. googletag.cmd.push “The initial intake is for  students but that will increase over five years and we need a financial commitment to resource that for every year and work on the wider expansion of Magee.” A General Medical Council spokesperson confirmed that the next date to comply with is the Graduate Medical School Admissions Testapplication process in July. A GMC spokesperson said: “There are stages that must be completed, required for all new medical school applications, before students can be recruited. “We will decide on the readiness of the University of Ulster to accept students in September , by the end of this July.” Since the May  announcement, key players in delivering the project including the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds and Arlene Foster have spoke of ‘signicant work’ and risk assessments that must be carried out before they can commit themselves to a date. Karen Mullan said that it is ‘dficult’ when there are ‘dissenting voices’ and it ‘does create that sense of fear that is out there’. She recognised that work still has to be done to get it over the line and ‘you can’t mitigate against something that is out of everybody’s control’. Asked is Sinn Feacutein is facing resistance from within the Executive Karen Mullan was clear that all parties signed up to the commitment laid out in the New Decade, New Approach document towards Magee. But she acknowledged that Magee is not a priority for other MLAs who are focused on their own constituencies. ‘TRANSPARENCY’ SDLP Leader, Colum Eastwood MP has expressed concern that the First Minister was unable to give SDLP MLA, Mark H Durkan, a cast iron guarantee that the Magee Medical School would be ready to open in September . The Foyle MP said: “The SDLP have been campaigning for Magee expansion for many years and we secured a ringfenced funding commitment as part of New Decade, New Approach. We also worked hard to secure a commitment to supporting Magee expansion in the draft Programme for Government in the south. “The money was made available and in the months that followed, we urged the DUP and Sinn Fein to make the necessary decisions and get this project delivered. “Not only did we find ourselves rebuked as negative when asking practical questions, we were told that it was a done deal. “Clearly, it is not as the First Minister was unable to provide these basic assurances today in the Assembly Chamber, when questioned by my colleague Mark H Durkan MLA. “We will continue to fight for the Medical School and a fully expanded Magee campus. We hope that it will still open next year, but this latest statement from the First Minister makes it more dficult. “At very least, the people of Derry deserve transparency and honesty from those holding the most senior positions in the Executive. SDLP Economy Spokesperson, Sinead McLaughlin MLA added: “This is a very disappointing lack of clarity and to be blunt, Im angry about it. We were promised the Magee Medical School was coming next year and now we are not sure. “We have to invest in training more doctors to reduce locum costs and to strengthen our health service. Covid- demonstrated the need, but it looks likely that Derry and the North West will be let down by the DUP and Sinn Fein, once again.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

From  July, subject to the rate of community transmission continuing to be low, people will no longer need to shield and should instead follow the same guidance and precautions as those considered to be generally vulnerable. That involves taking particular care when out and about - and strictly maintaining social distancing. Letters will be issued in the coming days to all those covered by shielding informing them of the planned change. Mr Swann stated:“I have been clear that shielding would not last one minute longer than it needed to. We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. googletag.cmd.push “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people. “It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July. “While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently. googletag.cmd.push “As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health. “Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding. We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

These exclusive photographs show the special screens which have been erected at Tinneys Bar in Derry. All other pubs are expected to install similar screens between staff and customers as the hospitality sector reopens following the coronavirus lockdown.  A local blinds shop has been assisting Derry bars and businesses as they prepare to reopen safely. Ace Blinds have been operating in the Derry area, serving the community for over five years and employing local people. As businesses adjust to the so-called new normal after lockdown, they have to enforce social distancing and come up with innovative ways to protect their customers. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, Ace Blinds has fitted ‘COVID- roller shields’ in local bars and the orders have been mounting from other businesses in the city. “It has gone a bit crazy at the minute and we have already taken  orders for bars,” says John Kelly of Ace Blinds. It is new territory for Ace Blinds in terms of the material they are using. “The plastic material suits bars great as they can be moved up and down very easily, not like perspex, and they are a lot easier on the eye for customers, so more friendly. They can be attached to suspension ceilings with a special clip so no drillingneeds be. googletag.cmd.push “The material is easily cleaned, you just hold the bottom bar and wipe clean and it can be secured to bars or the groundneeded.” The company has fitted the bathroom at EI Engineering to separate sinks which provides an extra layer of protection for workers. Other businesses in the town have come to them with dferent proposals which they’re working through together. This week, the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds announced that all non-essential goods retailers in Northern Ireland can re-open from tomorrow. Pubs and restaurants are expected to follow suit in July. Confirming the ‘major step forward’, the Minister said: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the local economy. The recovery has already begun and it is time now for the pace to accelerate. The re-opening of all goods retail outlets will be a huge part of this. “The safety of staff and customers is of course paramount. All retailers must be able to implement measures that minimise the risk to their staff and to the people who visit their stores. “We will be co-existing with this virus for some time to come so it is vital that we continue to adhere to guidance to work and live safely.” The Minister added: “The re-opening of our local shopping sector is a signicant step forward in the Executive’s pathway to recovery. I and my Executive colleagues remain committed to moving forward in the recovery while at all times keeping the health, wellbeing and safety of people at the centre and being transparent in our approach.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Crossroads Primary School in Kilrea have enlisted the help of Pearse’s GAC for the event, which will take place at Pearse Park on Thursday, June  at .am. The ceremony will be restricted to the families of Primary  pupils only, with designated car parking spaces mapped out for each pupil. Principal Eugene Mullan said the school wanted to do something special to mark the end of the pupils’ time at Crossroads. “I was racking my brain trying to think of something that was memorable and special for the Ps. They’ve missed out on so many experiences in Term ,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “We had a residential planned and we had all the end of season tournaments were ahead of us. We had a trip just before lockdown with the Year s and the school council to Stormont and at least they had that experience and got away together. “I’d considered doing a live stream, but I saw an ad for drive-in bingo in Banagher at the weekend and thought we’d give the prizegiving a go. “At least this way, the children can all come together. They won’t get to socialise with each other the way they normally would have, but at least they’ll be able to see one another.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Mullan said the venture was something the school had never attempted before, but that dficult times need creative thinking. “It’s a first for our school and I’ve never heard of a school doing a drive-in prizegiving before,” he said. “It’s an unprecedented time, though, so we have to come up with creative solutions and try and make it some way memorable for the children. “The big screen is being set up on Thursday morning and we’ll connect up a laptop with photo presentations so everyone can see and follow on with what’s happening. “All the P cars will have a designated parking space in an arc in front of the big screen and then extended family can park in behind.” The Ballerin native said Covid- had frustrated the school’s usual work in preparing the Primary  pupils for their transition to secondary education. “In Term  we would normally talk about moving on and any concerns or anxieties the children have,” he said. “We haven’t had a chance to do any of that and they’ve missed out on open days and taster days in their new schools too. “It’s going to be a big culture shock for them, but this should be special for the boys and girls and give them a nice send off.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Toilet facilities at the Banagher Dam car park were demolished in  after they fell into disrepair. The portable toilets that replaced them were also withdrawn following a dispute between NI Water, who own the site, and the Forestry Service, who manage it. Cllr Kathleen McGurk welcomed the reopening of some sites and said reinstating toilet facilities was ‘imperative’. “It is welcome news to see the reopening of these facilities as a tentative step out of lockdown,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “This will hopefully allow many more people to enjoy the fantastic scenery and outdoor recreational spaces our council area has to offer. “However it is imperative that the toilet facilities which were once at Banagher Glen are reinstated as a matter of urgency. “It is simply not acceptable that other recreational spaces are afforded more amenities than Banagher Glen. “If we hope to attract more tourism to the Dungiven Sperrins area of the Borough we should ensure we offer a world class experience, and that must include basic amenity facilities. “I will be contacting all stakeholders, Council, NI water and Forestry Services, to ensure that they engage with each other to provide the amenities that this recreational space deserves.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The proposal would involve demolishing a number of landmark buildings on Duke Street and the construction of  apartments in their place. Duke Street is one of the busiest thoroughfares in to the city and is used by thousands of vehicles each day. While there are a number of shops on the street, there are also several derelict buildings, including those earmarked for demolition as part of the apartment plans. The company behind the plans, Hillvalley Properties, have said that the new apartments would help regenerate the area. googletag.cmd.push It is understood that the apartments would be used for social housing. The access to the complex would be via Spencer Road. There are no plans for the car parking within the complex, as the developers say that the apartments are in a central position. Within the complex, there are also plans to construct a garden and soft play area. A statement submitted to Derry City and Strabane District Council on behalf of the applicant said: Most of the buildings included in the application have lain vacant for many years and their replacement will only improve the visual outlook of this street.” googletag.cmd.push An application for the Duke Street apartments has recently been submitted to the councils planning department. Last year, the council approved plans for the erection of a separate seven-story residential building that will house  new apartments at a nearby vacant site at the corner of Duke Street and Fountain Hill. The  units will include  one-bedroom and  two -bedroom apartments. The development also includes associated site works and the development of an amenity space.

The announcement was made today by the Northern Ireland Executive. Churches in the Republic will be reopening around the same time. “It is particularly helpful that parishes in cross-border communities will be able to plan together for a safeto Mass around the same time, said Archbishop Martin. I have been heartened by the amount of preparation which is already ongoing in our parishes to ensure that our sacred spaces will be as safe as possible when we begin to gather again together in prayer. googletag.cmd.push I expect that we will be beginning in a cautious way at first, and there will be a need for ongoing patience and careful monitoring of the situation. “In recent days, having spoken to priests across the dioceses of Armagh and Dromore, it is clear to me that there is a strong desire from our people, religious and priests to be able to celebrate the Eucharist and have access to the other sacraments, especially baptism, marriage and reconciliation. Archbishop Martin commended parishes for reaching out to parishioners in very dficult circumstances during the lockdown which included the broadcasting of Mass and other prayer opportunities by webcam. googletag.cmd.push Since March, we have also been alert to God’s presence in the lonely and the suffering. Sadly the pandemic has brought great hardship to many families whose loved ones have died because of the virus. In a lot of cases it was not possible for family members to be by their side, or to be present at their funeral. God knows our grief and how much we need strength, courage, consolation and comfort at this time”.

With handsanitiserat the door to every store, one-way systems, contactlesspayment, and limits on customernumbers, the new normal might take a while to get used to. Around half the shops in Foyleside Shopping Centre were open on Tuesday morning, with Dunnes Stores attracting the biggest crowds. Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books. If you would like to make a donation to Cancer Focus or to enquire about becoming a volunteer telephone .

With handsanitiserat the door to every store, one-way systems, contactlesspayment, and limits on customernumbers, the new normal might take a while to get used to. Around half the shops in Foyleside Shopping Centre were open on Tuesday morning, with Dunnes Stores attracting the biggest crowds. Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books. If you would like to make a donation to Cancer Focus or to enquire about becoming a volunteer telephone .

He spoke to Michael McMullan about his love for football, his career and answering Irelands call. *** It has always been football for Ruaidhri Higgins. Always. He has never known anything dferent. Even in Primary Four, Leo McCloskey saw enough to call him into the Termoncanice PS team. The following year, they lost a Northern Ireland final, before going one better  months later. It was the beginning for the man Stephen Kenny has put his trust into lead the scouting and analysis of the Republic of Ireland soccer team. googletag.cmd.push Higgins obsession for the game smashed through the roof when he began to play with the local Newtowne underage teams from the age of seven. “I wasnt one of those kids that was into cartoons, super heroes and Disney films, I was just obsessed by playing football from no age,” Ruaidhri begins. “I cant ever remember not playing it and it has been my le.” It began to get more serious when Kenny Shiels, who was taking his son Dean to play for Lisburn Youths at the time, asked Ruaidhris fatherhis son would join them. It was a prominent shop window for scouts, but the regular . kick-offs demanded a six oclock rise and trek up the M. googletag.cmd.push “It was a massive commitment,” Ruaidhri said, of his parents Danny and Marys time. For two years, it was Newtowne in the summer and Lisburn in the winter and all the travelling it entailed. They backed him  percent. Ruaidhri and Paddy are their youngest sons, with a  year gap to Michael and Kevin. “It is two dferent generations, but we are unbelievably close, the four of us,” Ruaidhri stresses. “I have been in every corner of Europe with football and they have always followed, they have been massive supporters in my career. “Without that upbringing and without that support, then I probably wouldnt be in the position I am in and wouldnt have had a career in this country like I had. I am very grateful and I dont take it for granted.” Ruaidhri played Gaelic football in his youth and as a pupil of St Marys Limavady lost an Ulster final replay to Coalisland. Growing up, he rarely missed a game when Derry were challenging for Sam Maguire. Even then, at the age of eight, Ruaidhri was deeper in thought than most. “The semi-final was probably the final, I remember when Johnny McGurk hit the winning score with his left foot,” Ruaidhri recalls of the  triumph, with the detail he will be using to suss out Irelands opponents. “It was a massive passion at that time but football shaded it. My brothers, my Da and my uncles first love would be GAA.” His first soccer football game was a trip to Parkhead to see Celtic come from - down to beat Dundee United in the Scottish Cup. He has been to Old Trafford, but doesnt have a favourite team. “I wouldnt say I am a fan of anyone. I am a football fan and I would look out for Celtic orUniteds score but it wouldnt ruin my weekendthey didnt win.” As the years passed, Ruaidhris prowess in the ious underage leagues attracted the attention of soccer scouts and was forward and back with too many clubs before opting for Coventry City. *** There were offers from more prominent clubs on the table, but Coventry attracted him. A chance for first team football, a long-term contract and hospitality all influenced his decision. “I was made feel unbelievably welcome, even at that age, by Gordon Strachan, the first team manager,” Ruaidhri states. “Richard Money, the Academy Director, and George Mackiemade my family feel unbelievably welcome every time we went over and made a big fuss.” Ruaidhri has no regrets about the move and completed his last two years of school in Coventry. At the time, a growth spurt led to knee problems and he spent the first two months in plaster and he didnt kick a ball for close to six months. “It was the right decision,” Ruaidhri points out of the club insisting he join earlier than anticipated. “I was playing through the pain barrier at home and they werent happy about it. Until they fixed it, I went  months in and out of playing because of the pain I was in. They had invested in me and were well within their rights. “It toughened me up. I moved away from home at  and had to become a man before a normal teenager, that stood me in good stead. Looking back, in terms of becoming more streetwise, it gave me a sound footing.” While he was happy with his progress in his first two years, he felt there was a genuine point he caught the eye of first-team manager Gary McAllister, who liked how Ruairi played in possession and he bagged two goals on his reserve debut. “I played really well and got peoples attention around the club,” Higgins felt. It was a quick evolution in how the game changed and relegation from the Championship sent out a warning message. “It was all about second balls and getting up and down the pitch. That didnt suit my style. Once athleticism started to take over from creative players, I kinda knew I might not have a career at that level,” he added. For four and half years, Coventry had high hopes for the Limavady man, but it faded away. When his contract ended, he wasnt too keen on going down the leagues. “It is a body blow to players when they get released from clubs in England. It is your dream, it is your passion, you feel you have failed.” Just when he needed a saviour, Stephen Kenny made the first of five important phone calls to Ruaidhri Higgins. *** With his teenage years coming to an end and his Coventry career over, an   number lit up on Ruaidhri Higgins phone. Kenny had just taken up the mantle as Derry City manager in August  and was putting together a squad. “I had never spoken to him before,” Ruaidhri reveals. “There was a definite rebuilding process when I came home, I wasnt the same person for six to  months. I lost my confidence and felt I had let people down,” he said, while stressing nothing was further from the truth. “Stephen was the perfect manager for me at that time. Living at home with my parents helped massively.” Slowly but surely he got his mojo back. “I owe Stephen a lot. In my first six months I played a lot in the reserve team just to get playing football again. I was performing better and better and running games in the reserves and it gave me the confidence that I could get my career back on track.” Kennys management skills continued, when he waited for the opportune moment to bed him back into the senior squad. It wasnt a rush, but rather some games to ease him into a regular spot. The Candystripes, with Higgins as a regular, won four League Cups in a row from  to . In , they won the FAI Cup with a - extra-time thriller, Kennys last game before taking over at Scottish side Dunfermline. After losing the  title to Cork City on the last day of the season, they missed the  treble after Shelbourne won the league on score dference. “Stephen brought great success and, particularly in  and , the Brandywell was packed and there was a great buzz”, Higgins states. “We had a really good run in Europe in  and that probably cost us the treble because of the backlog of games.” Derry beat IFK Gothenburg and Gretna before going out against Paris Saint-Germain - on aggregate, after holding the French side scoreless at the Brandywell in the first leg. Higgins played in both legs against Gothenburg and rates it has his European highlight. “They had three or four Swedish internationals that played in the  World Cup. We were something like - to win in Gothenburg,” he remembers. Kenny broke down their opponents in advance of the game, showing video clips of unknown teams and how they got results against Gothenburg. “I remember after that meeting, we walked out of it and we were thinking we have a helluva chance here. “We went out and deserved to win the game. It wasnt a smash and grab, it was an unbelievable performance. The home game we deserved to win that, we won - on aggregate and it was a massive achievement for the club.” Derry lost the FAI Cup final in  and were relegated to the First Division the following season, due to financial irregularities. “We went four or five months without pay. I had just bought a house, I had a mortgage and I had bills to pay,” Higgins points out. Pat Fenlon brought him to Bohemians. During the stint Bohs won the Setanta Cup, but Higgins was cup tied and missed out and again Higgins missed on a league medal on score dference to champions Shamrock Rovers. “I probably didnt do myself justice there. I had a decent period in mid-season, I lost my form and when Derry got promoted I went back there.” Back at the Brandywell, Higgins won a fth League Cup and in the FAI Cup decider, his flick on setup Rory Patterson for the extra-time winner. “We qualied for Europe through the league and were actually in the title race until four or five games in the season.” The  season, was one of Higgins best in a Derry shirt, but when Roddy Collins came in as manager, he wasnt in the plans. “I had a good season and had a new options and it was Stephenwho brought me to Dundalk and we won the League Cup, that was my sixth. It gave us the confidence to push on and win the league,” Higgins recalls. “We were trailing Cork going into the final game of the season. We played them at home and we beat them -, that was an amazing night. I was involved in four titles that went to the last game of the season, I lost three and won that one. “There has been a lot of ups and downs but thankfully there are a lot of good memories to look back on. You get lower with the downs than higher with the ups “Throughout my playing career in the League of Ireland, I averaged a trophy a season, so I had a successful enough playing career.” After a spell at Coleraine, where he also managed the U Academy squad, he began to focus more on coaching. He remembers Willie McKeown, then Coventrys Ireland scout telling him youve a great eye for the game and encouraging him to push on and get his coaching badges. “I had no interest at that time obviously. You have this dream of becoming a star footballer, but I genuinely always had an interest in the tactical side of the game,” said Higgins. Stephen Kenny also thought he had a good eye for the game and asked him to join Dundalks coaching staff. In the first season, they lost out to Cork City in the league. “I stayed in the role as analyst, we won thedouble and Stephen left to take theUs, Vinnywas promote to manager and I was promoted to assistant manager. So, I won the league with Dundalk in three dferent roles.” *** When Kenny was promoted to the Ireland manager post, he once again punched Higgins number into his phone. It was a brilliant call to get,not altogether a shock. “We have that relationship. He values me. It was a shock in a sense that it was the international stage, a dferent level. “It is a huge honour and a privilege to be asked. I had made my mind up very quickly because it is impossible to turn that opportunity down when it comes.” He acknowledges Dundalk, who he states were amazing in giving him the . Going to another League of Ireland Cup would have took some serious thinking. “When you are going to the international stage, it is incredibility tough to even consider turning that down,” Ruaidhri highlights. Now the work starts again in earnest. When I first call, he is scouring footage of European play-off opponents Bulgaria. His weeks are taken up with meetings, both online and face to face where circumstances allow it. “ One thing you can be sure, Stephen will have plenty for you to do and he leaves nothing to chance,” Ruaidhri stresses. “We have two games in early September, thats the main focus for myself, Stephen and the staff under him.” When le gets back to normal and gamesto the fixture calendar, Ruaidhri will be clocking up the air miles. “I will be going to watch our own players in England and reporting back, as well as studying the opposition,” he adds. Nothing beats being there and seeing a game in the flesh. The TV camera will only ever follow the ball. “If you have a birds eye view from the stand, you can see everything that is going on. When the ball is at this end of the pitch, what is the teams shape like back here. “When you are watching an inidual player, you literally focus on the player. It is dferentyou are watching a team. You are analysing the whole structure of the team. It is two completely dferent things,” Higgins continues. From playing on Termoncanices school team, to now, he is now an important cog in international football and takes Stephens approach as a massive compliment. “There are a lot of bigger names than me, who he couldve went after and have loved the position. He has huge trust in me and sees the value I can bring and I take it as a massive compliment and for me, it is a huge confidence booster.” He has never been at a major tournament as a fan. Watching from a pub as Damien Duff tore Spain apart in the  World Cup clash in Suwon is a memory, a game Ireland lost on penalties. “Damien was probably the best winger in the world and thats not exaggerating,” Higgins says of the man who, along with Alan Kelly and Keith Andrews, is now in the management setup with him. Now, qualying for a major tournament would be a dream, but as part of the management is also an objective Higgins has an input to. “We have an opportunity within the next two years of getting to the Euros and getting to a World Cup. “You dream of it when you were a small boy. We will be doing everything we can, it wont be from the want of trying. We have a really good group of players to go and try to achieve something special.” Football has always been Ruaidhri Higgins le. His skill set has opened the latest door of opportunity.

He spoke to Michael McMullan about his love for football, his career and answering Irelands call. *** It has always been football for Ruaidhri Higgins. Always. He has never known anything dferent. Even in Primary Four, Leo McCloskey saw enough to call him into the Termoncanice PS team. The following year, they lost a Northern Ireland final, before going one better  months later. It was the beginning for the man Stephen Kenny has put his trust into lead the scouting and analysis of the Republic of Ireland soccer team. googletag.cmd.push Higgins obsession for the game smashed through the roof when he began to play with the local Newtowne underage teams from the age of seven. “I wasnt one of those kids that was into cartoons, super heroes and Disney films, I was just obsessed by playing football from no age,” Ruaidhri begins. “I cant ever remember not playing it and it has been my le.” It began to get more serious when Kenny Shiels, who was taking his son Dean to play for Lisburn Youths at the time, asked Ruaidhris fatherhis son would join them. It was a prominent shop window for scouts, but the regular . kick-offs demanded a six oclock rise and trek up the M. googletag.cmd.push “It was a massive commitment,” Ruaidhri said, of his parents Danny and Marys time. For two years, it was Newtowne in the summer and Lisburn in the winter and all the travelling it entailed. They backed him  percent. Ruaidhri and Paddy are their youngest sons, with a  year gap to Michael and Kevin. “It is two dferent generations, but we are unbelievably close, the four of us,” Ruaidhri stresses. “I have been in every corner of Europe with football and they have always followed, they have been massive supporters in my career. “Without that upbringing and without that support, then I probably wouldnt be in the position I am in and wouldnt have had a career in this country like I had. I am very grateful and I dont take it for granted.” Ruaidhri played Gaelic football in his youth and as a pupil of St Marys Limavady lost an Ulster final replay to Coalisland. Growing up, he rarely missed a game when Derry were challenging for Sam Maguire. Even then, at the age of eight, Ruaidhri was deeper in thought than most. “The semi-final was probably the final, I remember when Johnny McGurk hit the winning score with his left foot,” Ruaidhri recalls of the  triumph, with the detail he will be using to suss out Irelands opponents. “It was a massive passion at that time but football shaded it. My brothers, my Da and my uncles first love would be GAA.” His first soccer football game was a trip to Parkhead to see Celtic come from - down to beat Dundee United in the Scottish Cup. He has been to Old Trafford, but doesnt have a favourite team. “I wouldnt say I am a fan of anyone. I am a football fan and I would look out for Celtic orUniteds score but it wouldnt ruin my weekendthey didnt win.” As the years passed, Ruaidhris prowess in the ious underage leagues attracted the attention of soccer scouts and was forward and back with too many clubs before opting for Coventry City. *** There were offers from more prominent clubs on the table, but Coventry attracted him. A chance for first team football, a long-term contract and hospitality all influenced his decision. “I was made feel unbelievably welcome, even at that age, by Gordon Strachan, the first team manager,” Ruaidhri states. “Richard Money, the Academy Director, and George Mackiemade my family feel unbelievably welcome every time we went over and made a big fuss.” Ruaidhri has no regrets about the move and completed his last two years of school in Coventry. At the time, a growth spurt led to knee problems and he spent the first two months in plaster and he didnt kick a ball for close to six months. “It was the right decision,” Ruaidhri points out of the club insisting he join earlier than anticipated. “I was playing through the pain barrier at home and they werent happy about it. Until they fixed it, I went  months in and out of playing because of the pain I was in. They had invested in me and were well within their rights. “It toughened me up. I moved away from home at  and had to become a man before a normal teenager, that stood me in good stead. Looking back, in terms of becoming more streetwise, it gave me a sound footing.” While he was happy with his progress in his first two years, he felt there was a genuine point he caught the eye of first-team manager Gary McAllister, who liked how Ruairi played in possession and he bagged two goals on his reserve debut. “I played really well and got peoples attention around the club,” Higgins felt. It was a quick evolution in how the game changed and relegation from the Championship sent out a warning message. “It was all about second balls and getting up and down the pitch. That didnt suit my style. Once athleticism started to take over from creative players, I kinda knew I might not have a career at that level,” he added. For four and half years, Coventry had high hopes for the Limavady man, but it faded away. When his contract ended, he wasnt too keen on going down the leagues. “It is a body blow to players when they get released from clubs in England. It is your dream, it is your passion, you feel you have failed.” Just when he needed a saviour, Stephen Kenny made the first of five important phone calls to Ruaidhri Higgins. *** With his teenage years coming to an end and his Coventry career over, an   number lit up on Ruaidhri Higgins phone. Kenny had just taken up the mantle as Derry City manager in August  and was putting together a squad. “I had never spoken to him before,” Ruaidhri reveals. “There was a definite rebuilding process when I came home, I wasnt the same person for six to  months. I lost my confidence and felt I had let people down,” he said, while stressing nothing was further from the truth. “Stephen was the perfect manager for me at that time. Living at home with my parents helped massively.” Slowly but surely he got his mojo back. “I owe Stephen a lot. In my first six months I played a lot in the reserve team just to get playing football again. I was performing better and better and running games in the reserves and it gave me the confidence that I could get my career back on track.” Kennys management skills continued, when he waited for the opportune moment to bed him back into the senior squad. It wasnt a rush, but rather some games to ease him into a regular spot. The Candystripes, with Higgins as a regular, won four League Cups in a row from  to . In , they won the FAI Cup with a - extra-time thriller, Kennys last game before taking over at Scottish side Dunfermline. After losing the  title to Cork City on the last day of the season, they missed the  treble after Shelbourne won the league on score dference. “Stephen brought great success and, particularly in  and , the Brandywell was packed and there was a great buzz”, Higgins states. “We had a really good run in Europe in  and that probably cost us the treble because of the backlog of games.” Derry beat IFK Gothenburg and Gretna before going out against Paris Saint-Germain - on aggregate, after holding the French side scoreless at the Brandywell in the first leg. Higgins played in both legs against Gothenburg and rates it has his European highlight. “They had three or four Swedish internationals that played in the  World Cup. We were something like - to win in Gothenburg,” he remembers. Kenny broke down their opponents in advance of the game, showing video clips of unknown teams and how they got results against Gothenburg. “I remember after that meeting, we walked out of it and we were thinking we have a helluva chance here. “We went out and deserved to win the game. It wasnt a smash and grab, it was an unbelievable performance. The home game we deserved to win that, we won - on aggregate and it was a massive achievement for the club.” Derry lost the FAI Cup final in  and were relegated to the First Division the following season, due to financial irregularities. “We went four or five months without pay. I had just bought a house, I had a mortgage and I had bills to pay,” Higgins points out. Pat Fenlon brought him to Bohemians. During the stint Bohs won the Setanta Cup, but Higgins was cup tied and missed out and again Higgins missed on a league medal on score dference to champions Shamrock Rovers. “I probably didnt do myself justice there. I had a decent period in mid-season, I lost my form and when Derry got promoted I went back there.” Back at the Brandywell, Higgins won a fth League Cup and in the FAI Cup decider, his flick on setup Rory Patterson for the extra-time winner. “We qualied for Europe through the league and were actually in the title race until four or five games in the season.” The  season, was one of Higgins best in a Derry shirt, but when Roddy Collins came in as manager, he wasnt in the plans. “I had a good season and had a new options and it was Stephenwho brought me to Dundalk and we won the League Cup, that was my sixth. It gave us the confidence to push on and win the league,” Higgins recalls. “We were trailing Cork going into the final game of the season. We played them at home and we beat them -, that was an amazing night. I was involved in four titles that went to the last game of the season, I lost three and won that one. “There has been a lot of ups and downs but thankfully there are a lot of good memories to look back on. You get lower with the downs than higher with the ups “Throughout my playing career in the League of Ireland, I averaged a trophy a season, so I had a successful enough playing career.” After a spell at Coleraine, where he also managed the U Academy squad, he began to focus more on coaching. He remembers Willie McKeown, then Coventrys Ireland scout telling him youve a great eye for the game and encouraging him to push on and get his coaching badges. “I had no interest at that time obviously. You have this dream of becoming a star footballer, but I genuinely always had an interest in the tactical side of the game,” said Higgins. Stephen Kenny also thought he had a good eye for the game and asked him to join Dundalks coaching staff. In the first season, they lost out to Cork City in the league. “I stayed in the role as analyst, we won thedouble and Stephen left to take theUs, Vinnywas promote to manager and I was promoted to assistant manager. So, I won the league with Dundalk in three dferent roles.” *** When Kenny was promoted to the Ireland manager post, he once again punched Higgins number into his phone. It was a brilliant call to get,not altogether a shock. “We have that relationship. He values me. It was a shock in a sense that it was the international stage, a dferent level. “It is a huge honour and a privilege to be asked. I had made my mind up very quickly because it is impossible to turn that opportunity down when it comes.” He acknowledges Dundalk, who he states were amazing in giving him the . Going to another League of Ireland Cup would have took some serious thinking. “When you are going to the international stage, it is incredibility tough to even consider turning that down,” Ruaidhri highlights. Now the work starts again in earnest. When I first call, he is scouring footage of European play-off opponents Bulgaria. His weeks are taken up with meetings, both online and face to face where circumstances allow it. “ One thing you can be sure, Stephen will have plenty for you to do and he leaves nothing to chance,” Ruaidhri stresses. “We have two games in early September, thats the main focus for myself, Stephen and the staff under him.” When le gets back to normal and gamesto the fixture calendar, Ruaidhri will be clocking up the air miles. “I will be going to watch our own players in England and reporting back, as well as studying the opposition,” he adds. Nothing beats being there and seeing a game in the flesh. The TV camera will only ever follow the ball. “If you have a birds eye view from the stand, you can see everything that is going on. When the ball is at this end of the pitch, what is the teams shape like back here. “When you are watching an inidual player, you literally focus on the player. It is dferentyou are watching a team. You are analysing the whole structure of the team. It is two completely dferent things,” Higgins continues. From playing on Termoncanices school team, to now, he is now an important cog in international football and takes Stephens approach as a massive compliment. “There are a lot of bigger names than me, who he couldve went after and have loved the position. He has huge trust in me and sees the value I can bring and I take it as a massive compliment and for me, it is a huge confidence booster.” He has never been at a major tournament as a fan. Watching from a pub as Damien Duff tore Spain apart in the  World Cup clash in Suwon is a memory, a game Ireland lost on penalties. “Damien was probably the best winger in the world and thats not exaggerating,” Higgins says of the man who, along with Alan Kelly and Keith Andrews, is now in the management setup with him. Now, qualying for a major tournament would be a dream, but as part of the management is also an objective Higgins has an input to. “We have an opportunity within the next two years of getting to the Euros and getting to a World Cup. “You dream of it when you were a small boy. We will be doing everything we can, it wont be from the want of trying. We have a really good group of players to go and try to achieve something special.” Football has always been Ruaidhri Higgins le. His skill set has opened the latest door of opportunity.

His book has been described in The Independent as ldquoone of the finest pieces of modern nature writing in recent years. In this extract the autistic teenager shares his joy of the natural world on a day out to Murlough with his sister and brother.OUR garden is thrumming with birds today: coal, blue and great tits, blackbird, thrush, magpie, jackdaw, rook, all of them revelling on the grass, pecking at the feeders.I could happily watch them all day but rain is coming from the east, so we decide to go west to the coast at Murlough to stay in the sunshine. I usually despise being in the sun. I find its light too bright, its heat too hot, and it can make me feel astherersquos nowhere to hide. But with this rain coming, I feel like being on the dunes at Murlough, pressed by warmth and sea breezes.The ancient dune system here is six thousand years old, fragile and spectacular. The unusually high dunes were formed in the late th and th centuries by massive storms, and were used by people in the Middle Ages as rabbit warrens to provide them with meat and pelts.Grazing rabbits encouraged the grassy heathland here, but when myxomatosis first broke out in the s, as it did in other parts of Ireland and Britain, the population was almost wiped out. With fewer rabbits, sea buckthorn and sycamore could grow, turning heath to scrubland. Now the National Trust have intervened at Murlough, managing the landscape so it reverts back to heath mdash and judging from the copious pings, it looks like the rabbits are thriving again, too.The day is sparkling, the wind is shaking and shaping the clouds. Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid want to swim, so I stroll along the beach with my binoculars. Shapes out at sea stop me: a trinity of torpedoing gannets. They swoop, wheel and suddenly drop, spiralling until the last second when they transform into arrows before hitting the water.Swallows are overhead ndash I can see their small bodies so clearly, weightless and constantly moving. I feel myself rising with them.My dark, knotted thoughts seem to be staying away at the moment. I feel as free as the gannets and swallows. If they can live their lives, shouldnrsquot I do the same  Can I breathe and live and also fight  The natural world mdash which includes us mdash is facing such enormous challenges that itrsquos easy to become overwhelmed and depressed. But we must fix them, andIrsquom no longer here, alive, I canrsquot be part of the solution.What is it thatrsquos holding me back  Anxiety  Depression  Autism  These are the shackles. Surely, I can break free. Or at least I can accept these things as part of me. I have no answers, but the lightness of these thoughts and these days weave my body and mind with everything around me. The only thing that I am really bound to is nature ndash as we all are.Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid are running towards me, and I run to them, and then we run together, exultant. We slow down in unison, all feeling the same pull of the large peculiar shells dotted around the beach. We each pick one up and hold them outstretched, delicate porcelain in our hands.They look like pale planets, pockmarked with symmetrical lines. I rattle mine, listening to the whisper of sand and the past. These are sea potatoes mdash a type of sand-burrowing sea urchin mdash with pocks that once held spines and a bleached calcium carbonate shell that could so easily shatter on land or at sea. Each one is a miracle. So many miracles washed up at once.We start to collect them and Lorcan decides to name three of the best specimens Sandy, Sam and Sandra. He holds a conversation with them, three sea potatoes, which makes us laugh so hard that tears well up and almost flow, and wersquore still laughing as a warm rain starts to fall on us.Under dark skies, I feel completely unburdened of any doubts in my own abilities to help our planet. Instead, I feel energised and ready. Sopping wet and cold and with chattering teeth, still giggling madly, I feel hope pouring in the rain. Being myself is enough.Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Tollerand can be bought online, or at No Alibis bookshop in Belfast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A lifetime of capturing Ireland’s scenic beauty  ","story":"AMATEUR photographer Chris Laverty spent a letime capturing Irelandrsquos scenic beauty.The former Queenrsquos University computer centre manager travelled extensively, always with his camera, and always with an eye for the magic of the countryside around him.

As we work to do so, our absolute priority will be to keep our patients, service users and staff safe. the statement adds.The health trustrsquos insistence that emergency services will be restored at the Downe comes ahead of a meeting with a Sinn Fein delegation to discuss the issue.Spearheaded by South Down MP, Chris Hazzard, the delegation will be seeking assurances that all services will be restored to their previous level.Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hazzard said that due to the pandemic, the local community was left without access to vital services at the Downe due to the health systemrsquos response to coronavirus which ldquorequired what amounted to extraordinary measures for an extraordinary time.The MP said the Downe was left ldquounrecognisable as emergency and outpatient services, amongst others, closed from the end of March.ldquoWhere required, all available staff and equipment from these units was also requisitioned for use in other parts of the South Eastern Trust area, he continued.ldquoIn agreeing to the radical reconfiguration of the Downe, the community made a big sacrice in order to accommodate the unprecedented demands made by both health trusts in the fight against Covid-.Insisting that it was the right thing to do at the right time, Mr Hazzard said there is now an onus on trust management to respond in kind to the community.He said the recently published recovery plans have delayed the restoration of vital services to the community, causing signicant concern amongst many who fear that ldquotemporary closure might inevitably mean permanent removal.Mr Hazzard said the Sinn Fein delegation will be calling for the full restoration of services at the Downe and will also be meeting with the chief executive of the Southern Trust to call for services removed from Newryrsquos Daisy Hill hospital to be reinstated.Rowallane DUP councillors are also demanding the full restoration of services at the Downe Hospital, highlighting the importance of reopening the emergency department as soon as possible.Cllr Billy Walker said it was ironic that within hours of confirmation that the Downpatrick ED would not reopen at this stage, the South Eastern Trust revealed via social media that the Ulster Hospitalrsquos emergency department was extremely busy.ldquoThis is nothing new, he declared. ldquoThere is a clear need for the Downersquos emergency department to reopen now. Having this facility available can help ease the pressure on other EDs and we cannot understand why there is not increased investment in Downpatrick.ldquoWe all understood the temporary closure of services at the Downe to allow health chiefs to respond to the global pandemic, but the time for those services to be reinstated is now.

However, bearing in mind the scheme is all but shovel ready, this should be a simple case of signing the commencement orders with construction starting as soon as possible.Mr Hazzard said the roads minister has a capital budget of more than poundm to be spent this year, suggesting that very few projects are as advanced as the Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThere is no logical reason why this long overdue project canrsquot get the green light for construction as a matter of priority, he said.The MP added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would be a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Darragh Cross residents bring cheer to local residential home  ","story":"RESIDENTS from Oakland Court in Darragh Cross made the most of the lockdown by having socially distanced nights of entertainment while helping the residents of a nearby residential home.From hosting fun events such as bingo and discos, they raised pound for Willowview Residential Home in Saintfield.Oakland Court residents would like to thank Darragh Crossrsquo Vivo shop for its donation of prize hampers and everyone who donated prizes and gts.In turn, all residents and staff of Willowview Residential Home would like to say pay their gratitude to to all the residents of Oakland Court and Darragh Cross Vivo for their kindness and thoughtfulness..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing on dog dirt  ","story":"SENIOR Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers say they will need time to research the issue of using DNA testing on dog dirt in a bid to trace animals which are allowed to use public areas as open air toilets.Members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee will discuss the issue at their virtual meeting later today.A motion on the issue tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown at the March meeting of the full council was referred to the local authority committee for discussion.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines.Cllr Brown is also eager for council officials to draw upon best practice from other councils who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.In addition, he wants the local authority to roll out what he has described as an ldquoenhanced public awareness campaign focusing on the dangers of dog fouling.Ahead of tonightrsquos council meeting, officers are recommending that Cllr Brownrsquos motion is agreed to allow them time to research similar schemes which have been introduced where.In addition, officers say that they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme locally beforereporting back to the council committee.Politicians, who have previously asked for more enforcement staff to be deployed across the district to deal with the dog fouling problem, say the highly contentious issue is one of the single most complained about problems in the area.They say that despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Drive in assembly at Crossgar primary school  ","story":"CEDAR Integrated Primary School in Crossgar has said farewell to its P pupils.Staff held a drive-in leavers ceremony for the outgoing P class last Friday.Parents and carers were invited to park in the playground and watch the  pupils receive folders of their work from their time at Cedar.They also received a survival kit for lsquobig schoolrsquo, as well as trophies for sports, arts and ICT,.

He was also famous for discovering milk chocolate.Born in Killyleagh on April , , Sir Hans died in Cha in , aged  and described as the worldrsquos greatest collector who, from his earliest years, catalogued and carefully encased every artefact that he found.Over the years he accumulated nearly , items many of which today are on display in the British Museum.Close to the picturesque harbour in Killyleagh stands a copy of the London statue in honour of Sir Hans with a local councillor branding the campaign to take down the statues in the capital as ldquoridiculousCllr Billy Walker insists that the pioneering physician was not a slave trader and that the clamour for many statues to be taken down was becoming ldquosilly, urging the Government to show some backbone on the matter.He said Sir Hans was ldquorevered in his home town where people were proud to have a copy of the statue to a man who did so much for the world.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoSir Hans gave us the concept of free museums, found a cure for smallpox and pioneered science and medicine to do away with magic for treating illness.ldquoHe also promoted the use of quinine against malaria, discovered milk chocolate and was the first man to lead both Royal Colleges. Sir Hans also treated the poor for free and was no slave trader.Cllr Walker said Sir Hans left Killyleagh for London when he was  where he studied chemistry, before deciding on a career in medicine, qualying in France and ing to London.He was subsequently appointed as the personal physician to the governor of Jamaica and it was there that he discovered drinking chocolate.When he ed to England, Sir Hans was able to market his find and Cadburyrsquos promoted this drink for many years.Cllr Walker said that Sir Hans, who has a centre named after him in his home town, encouraged inoculation against ious diseases and for  years was President of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Fellow and hard working secretary of the Royal Society for many years.ldquoWe in Killyleagh are rightly very proud of Sir Hans and his links with our town, he continued.The councillor added: ldquoI hope that his statue in London will remain in place as he was a man of great distinction which is evidenced by the fact that there is now a centre dedicated to him in his home town.

In addition to the services directly provided at our local hospital mdash the peoplersquos hospital mdash Downe staff were redeployed to other healthcare facilities andcontributed enormously to the NHS effort.When the emergency planning was taking effect, it was the clear understanding of many local political and community representatives, that the emergency department service would be restored immediately upon the conclusion of the pandemic.Whilst there is clearly a signicant possibility of a so-called second surge in infections mdash and we are all aware as to just how serious such a second surge could be mdash at the same time there is increased normalisation of health provision across the North.The restoration of the urgent care service previously provided at the Downe must be a top priority as part of this normalisation. It should have been included in the June action plan, published by the health trust last week.Just last week, as attendances were increasing at the remaining emergency departments, including at the Ulster Hospital, it was apparent that existing facilities are and will be unable to cope with demand.During the Covid emergency planning, decisions were taken to temporarily close the emergency departments at the Downe, Daisy Hill and the Mater hospitals.Just last week, trade union representatives received categorical assurances from the Southern Trust about the re-opening of about Daisy Hill Hospital. Similar assurances are now required about the Downe.There is also a signicant impetus gathering now for the implementation of restructuring of healthcare services generally, and of urgent care in particular, across Northern Ireland.Decisions about the future of healthcare, particularly urgent care, afford an excellent opportunity to redress health inequalities that have arisen and been perpetuated by the historic under investment in the health service by successive governments and by the pursuit of centralisation policies.Many people believe that those centralisation policies played a crucial role in leaving us facing into a pandemic with insufficient hospital beds, insufficient intensive care beds, insufficient ambulance cover, insufficient ventilators and insufficient healthcare workers.Any change to emergency and urgent care provision is only permissible where it happens with the consent of the people.In the final analysis, decisions about the allocation of healthcare resources are political decisions taken by politicians, elected by the people and not by bureaucrats. Tiers and levels of bureaucracy make no dference to where ultimate responsibility lies.I have a great deal of sympathy for the recently appointed health minister, Robin Swann, who within a few weeks of his appointment, found himself facing the biggest public health emergency in the history of the National Health Service.I would respectfully suggest that Mr Swann should insist upon the criteria for change stated by Michelle OrsquoNeill when she was Health Minister.The now Deputy First Minister stated in November  that local people should be at the centre of decision-making processes in designing and delivering services. The , people who marched through Downpatrick in support of the Downe Hospitalin the Love the Downe Rally on February , , would certainly agree with that.As far back as , Dr Michael McBride, speaking at the sod cutting ceremony for the new Downe Hospital, said that ldquothe emphasis would be on making the health system respond to the patient rather than the patient to the system. I concur with that.In the Down Recorder of November , , after the publication of the Bengoa Report, Michelle OrsquoNeill was quoted as saying: ldquoWe will deliver care and support in the most appropriate settings, ideally in peoplersquos homes and communities.Again, I would concur with that.If there is to be a change in urgent care provision across Northern Ireland, no one can expect to be immune from that change. At the same time, change would only be possible or acceptableit is to create a better service for all of the people and a fair and equitable distribution of services.Many people in this area believe that we have had a very raw deal for over  years from the health service and some politicians.It sometimes seems to be forgotten that the National Health Service is free at the point of use, but it is certainly not without cost. It is the people who pay for it.Rural communities have particular characteristics and needs that must be addressed, in terms of at the most basic, accessibility to services. Like everyone , they have rights.Access to healthcare is a right, not a privilege.If it is to be the case that urgent care is being restructured, citizens in rural areas which, for this purpose, includes virtually anyone outside the Greater Belfast area, cannot be expected to forego services so that Belfast can continue to enjoy a proleration of emergency services, with not one but two Type  emergency departments on the scale of that at the Ulster Hospital, on its overdeveloped and cramped site, the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Mater, with the Type  unit at the Lagan Valley hospital, just seven miles from Belfast, a similar distance to that travelled by the people of Ardglass to the Downe hospital.Of course, Type  emergency departments are also to be found at Antrim and Craigavon, neither of which are far from Belfast and are linked by the best possible road infrastructure.Logically, it would seem, that the existence of two Type  units in Belfast is not sustainable, given the apparent massive pressure on services.We were told by the Department of Health at the time of the January  public meeting in Downpatrick Cricket Club that the purpose of that meeting was to enable local people to ldquofundamentally shape, inform and influence the criteria to be used to deliver services in the future.We hope that is still the case and await meaningful engagement with the community before change is implemented.The then deputy permanent secretary was quoted as having said that the then Minister would want to see ldquoongoing engagement in redesigning services. I am sure that the current Health Minister has the same views.The challenge for the Health Minister in the future must surely be to develop a fair and equitable distribution of services that would end discrimination against rural communities and ensure that all services, including ambulance services, are readily accessible to all of the people.It is worth remembering as well, that there was actually a .%in the attendances at emergency departments in Northern Ireland between December  and December . In the same period, attendances at the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department rose signicantly.Decisions about change in the health service are political decisions. All of the major parties form the Northern Ireland Executive, which is collectively accountable for the program for government and all that it delivers or fails to deliver for the people.It is imperative that any attempt to change or restructure healthcare provision in Northern Ireland is done so in full consultation with the end users of the services, who are also the paymasters for it. This will be very dficult, as history has created a deep mistrust between substantial elements in our community and the Department of Health.Our community has suffered greatly from repeated cuts to services and the ruthless pursuit of a centralisation agenda a pursuit that has continued even in recent years when the NHS in England and Wales has been investing in and supporting smaller hospitals, recognising their crucial roles at the heart of local communities and using technological advances to support them.If it appears that Covid- is being used as a cover to implement long-standing Department of Health policy, then any changes would be resented by the community and in fact rejected by it. This would lead to an irreparable breach of trust between the people and the State.If an attempt is made to in any way reduce the services that are currently on offer at the Downe Hospital, this community, as it has done before, will rise up in righteous indignation.Twenty five thousand people took to the streets of Downpatrick in February . If our emergency department is not restored within a reasonable timescale mdash a matter of weeks mdash it is very likely that this area will see an unprecedented display of anger, with , plus people on the street, with legal challenges about any perceived abuse of process and a community-wide campaign, a cross-community campaign and political upheaval at the highest level of government.The people of East and South Down have had enough. They have reluctantly sacriced local services, as a temporary measure in the short term, but their resolve should not be underestimated.The people of Newcastle, Ballynahinch, Castlewellan, Ardglass, Killough, Clough, Downpatrick, Strangford, Crossgar, Lower Mourne and the vast surrounding rural hinterland need these services.Farmers, fishermen and builders need emergency care as much as ever, so too do the tourists who flock into our area every year and probably will do so in even greater numbers this year.It is time to restore the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department and it is time to concentrate investment in local services, delivering for the people who need the services, where they need those services.The NHS must serve the people from ldquocradle to grave. It is a part of the social contract between the people and those who govern them.Politicians and administrators come and go. The Downe hospital must live on, developing all the time the range of services it offers.Equality demands nothing less..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Revered servant of local cricket  ","story":"Robin Walsh remembers Alfie Linehan, the distinguished Downpatrick cricket stalwart who died last yearTHE great paradox of Alfie Linehan was to be found in his disposition on the cricket field and off it.At the crease, his was a belligerent style, hitting the ball farther than anyone , compiling his runs in a manner that kept the scorers busy. Beyond the boundary!Yet this domineering, almost bullying, approach belied one of Irish cricketrsquos truest gentlemen off it: soft-spoken, never a word that offended, never a word against him.In one of the most distinguished legacies to the local game, the late Downpatrick farmer captained the Ireland team before turning to administration in the roles of chairman and president of the Northern Cricket Union and president of the Irish Cricket Union.Yet it was where it mattered most, at the grassroots of the game, that Alfie left his indelible mark.His devotion to the Downpatrick club and its famous international ground The Meadow was boundless and le-long, from underage player to captain of the club, coach and ultimately chairman and president.He either played or captained Downpatrick in five NCU Senior League, three Senior Cup-winning sides and an Irish Senior Cup triumph along with his older brother Hugh, another talented batsman whose death at the age of  dealt a terrible blow to Alfie.In later years it was a source of great pride that Hughrsquos son, Paul, was to captain the club and daughter Anne played for Ireland.His wersquos nephew, James Cunningham, also captained the club.Alfiersquos hard-hitting ways over four decades from the s took him to  Irish appearances mdash six of them as captain mdash in the days when international caps were much less liberally awarded, and his contribution to the success of NCU representative cricket has rarely been equalled.Administration was an endless labour of love at local, provincial and national level. Such was his accommodating nature that he chaired countless committees ranging from solving an umpire shortage in the NCU to raising funds at ICU golf days.His contribution to his local community extended far beyond the boundaries of the cricket club.In his day he was a member of the NI Sports Council, a director of his local hospital trust and president of Ardglass Golf Club.Alfiersquos friends were legion, none more close than Cecil Walker, that leading light of the Lisburn club.Their playing days over, they travelled the world with their wives watching international cricket and storing delightful memories of new friendships, whether tales of the Bodyline era over tea with Harold Larwood at his home in Sydney, or a fond mention by David lsquoBumblersquo Lloyd from the commentary box.Of all thatrsquos been written down the years about Alfie Linehan, one game has been overlooked and yet it speaks more than any of his commitment to Downpatrick.It was Saturday, August , , and Downpatrick were due to play Lurgan. It was also the day of Alfiersquos wedding to his beloved Mary. No problem: wedding in the morning, cricket in the afternoon, reception in the evening, off on honeymoon the next day.Of all the tributes paid to Alfie none has been more signicant than that on BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme last December.He was included in the prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who had died during .

Following a prolonged period of dry weather water levels have dropped to around %. It hasnt been that low since . Picture: Michael CooperSince the beginning of lockdown, the company has seen a signicant rise in the amount of water used in homes.This rise, coupled with the dry weather, has contributed to a drop in water levels in reservoirs.Increased household use has not been offset by the closure of businesses, as many high water users, such as the agri-food sector, factories etc. have been able to stay operational during this time. NI Water Chief Executive Sara Venning said: “This recent dry spell, which has been breaking records, coupled with more people at home using more water, has resulted in a signicant drop in our water levels.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We would need a period of reasonably wet weather before we would see a signicant change in the levels of most of our reservoirs.“There are a number of steps NI Water can take to alleviate the stress on reservoirs including a hosepipe ban.However, the key to conserving water is public action now.How we all use our water now will have a massive impact on our water levels during the summer months and on whether a hosepipe ban will be required.“For example, we know from the increase in our night usage some customers are leaving sprinklers and hoses on overnight we are appealing to them to stop.A sprinkler left on overnight is enough to meet the daily water needs of  families. We are also asking people to think before they use their pressure washer. Could the task be put off until we are out of this dry period  “However, the easiest way for everyone to save a little water and make a big dference is through normal household tasks.If each of us turned off the tap when brushing our teeth, in a month we would save enough water for the daily handwashing of  people.  “Similarly,you put a jug of water into the fridge rather than running the tap, those actions alone would save approximately  litres per day.This is enough to keep  people hydrated for a whole day! “We want everyone to enjoy their home and garden, we just need people to think about how they use their water andwhat they are doing is essential.If it is not essential we would really appeal to people not do it at the moment.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We weren’t alone, with the BMA and nursing professional bodies concurring. We were denied sight of ‘the science’ until Imperial College’s research was leaked. This ideological, Darwinesque, anarchistic push from the libertarian-right set an unfortunate tone from which we should all guard. The botched ‘closure’ of schools in Northern Ireland, with + schools remaining open to receive, on average, just two, three or four children of key workers, was a reflection of local political dference. Far too many schools opened during lockdown and teachers could do little about this.NEU have contributed positively with the minister for education and the department to find ways forward. Our detailed -page discussion document “On ato Education in Northern Ireland” was widely praised as a positive pupil-centred contribution when presented publicly and to the Assembly Education Committee. Our teachers and educators have continued to work long hours, well beyond the constricts of their contracts. Teachers well understand that disadvantage is compounded for the most marginalised pupils during lockdown. With infection rates dropping, and the economy struggling, we all accept that calculated risks are required for some sort of normalisation to occur. Our recent meeting with the minister on th June was wholly constructive and collegiate.It is time to ‘dial-down’ the tone of the discourse and work together, positively, for a safeto schooling in mid to late August.Mark Langhammer, Regional Secretary, NEU, Northern Ireland ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch on social media.There is a lsquoPODS public grouprsquo on Facebook, PODS quiz nights are being held on Zoom, and there is a website to keep track at podspenarth.org article_url   content_id   site_id

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

an Alliance councillor has said.By The NewsroomThursday, th June , : pm\"\"Cyclists.Alliance Party representative, Councillor Peter Lavery, called on Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council to take a more proactive role in local active travel and has asked that time be set aside during July’s meeting of Council’s planning committee to discuss the issue.“It has been great to see an increased number of people out cycling during the past few months,” said Cllr Lavery.“We as a public body need to be proactive and collaborate with experts to create ideas and put plans in place to harness this renewed enthusiasm for the long term.“Looking to the future, Alliance believes that government needs to rebalance funding away from roads and into more sustainable transportforms so that an increased number of transport choice are viable for residents.“This would include integrating public transport by creating links between the bus and rail network, car users and cyclists.”Noting recent announcements from the Department for Infrastructurerelating to cycle lanes and greenways, Cllr Lavery asked why this borough should not enjoy the same amenities.“The point also need to be made that when it comes to investment in projects like greenways and cycle lanes there is more to Northern Ireland than just Belfast and Derry,” he said.“Although I welcome investment in those cities, we in the ABC Council area are the second biggest in terms of population so we cannot be left behind.”A spokesperson for Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council said Council remains committed to active travel.“Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council is committed to active travel,” said the spokesperson.“Our Corporate plan outlines a number of short term outcomes to ensure, ‘There is understanding of and respect for the contribution of the built and natural environment and the role it plays in improving the health and vitality of urban and rural communities, their sense of place, character and identity’.“And, ‘Our physical and environmental assets are accessible. Everyone appreciates and takes responsibility for their protection, preservation and enhancement’.”The spokesperson continued: “In addition to a number of active travel projects already completed, the Council is continuing to develop and deliver initiativesto allow it to meet these objectives.“Active travel is a unique resource as a potential driver for economic regeneration and user well beingand the council is currently looking at ‘The One Path’ initiative in order to discuss and understand the issues people face when using shared paths and to collaboratively develop ways which help people to better share the space.“The Council is currently investigating the possibility of delivering a Landcare project in the Carn, Seagoe and Charlestown industrial areas of the Borough with the aim of developing the infrastructure around existing walking and cycling networks.“The Council fully understands the importance of implementing active travel within our infrastructure and is open to exploring all options to help benefit the lives of all who live, work and visit our Borough.”Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1592493837675.jpg--health_minister_issues_shielding_advice.jpg?159249383700","title":"health minister issues shielding advice ","story":"Health Minister Robin Swann has announced plans to pause the shielding advice that was issued to people ahead of the Covid- peak in Northern Ireland.

We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people.“It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July.“While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently.“As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health.“Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding.We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cdfdceddbfcaedc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbaccbef   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
