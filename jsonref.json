Regardless, the storm is expected to deal serious damage to both coastal and inland communities thanks to its strong winds and heavy rains.Even if it doesn’t intensify as much as forecast, the storm is still expected to be very dangerous, bringing hurricane-force winds greater than 74 miles per hour to the northeastern Gulf Coast by Wednesday, October 10 in the area currently under a hurricane warning.  This area currently s  from just north of Tampa Bay Area to the Alabama coastline, though tropical storm-force winds above 39 miles per hour are also expected to be felt in this area from the night of Tuesday, October 9 until the morning of Wednesday, October 10.Areas just outside the hurricane warning region currently under a tropical storm warning will likely see tropical storm-force winds on the night of Tuesday, October 9 and morning of Wednesday, October 10.    The powerful hurricane will bring torrential rains, strong winds and catastrophic storm surgeThe hurricane’s path is projected to bring widespread power outages to the Florida Panhandle region and even to southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia, potentially leaving up to two million people without power from Florida to southeastern Virginia.In addition, life-threatening storm surges as high as eight to 12 feet are possible from the western end of the Florida Panhandle all the way to the Tampa Bay Area.For rainfall, the storm is expected to dump four to eight inches in the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend region of Florida into southern Georgia and southeastern Alabama. Local rainfall of up to a foot is possible while life-threatening flash flooding cannot be ruled out either.Eastern Georgia, the Carolinas and southern Virginia could potentially see three to six inches of rain while parts of the Florida Peninsula, Mid-Atlantic and New England regions could possibly see one to three inches of rain.The storm could also bring some isolated tornadoes to the Florida Panhandle and southern Georgia.How wide is Hurricane Michael?The storm is threatening more than 300 miles of the Golf Coast and is expected to make landfall along a 150-mile stretch of the Florida coast.Hurricane Michael evacuation zonesAs the dangerous storm bears down on the Florida Panhandle and broader northeastern Gulf Coast region, mandatory evacuations have already been issued.Three Florida counties have ordered mandatory evacuations, including Gulf County, where the storm could potentially make a direct landfall hit.Wakulla County has ordered a mandatory evacuation for all residents in its Zone A evacuation zone as well as for residents living in weak structures and mobile homes. Bay County has also issued a mandatory evacuation for Zones A, B and C.When will Hurricane Michael make landfall?Though the exact landfall area of the monstrous storm isn’t yet known, officials have expressed increased confidence that it will ultimately be in the Florida Panhandle.Florida Governor Rick Scott didn’t mince words when warning residents about the storm, saying: ‘Hurricane Michael is forecast to be the most destructive storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in decades.’    The Florida Panhandle is in the crosshairs of Hurricane Michael as it barrels towards the coastAccording to FEMA official Jeff Byard, hurricane-force winds are expected to extend ‘well inland’ from where the storm makes landfall, noting that Florida’s power infrastructure could be hit even worse than North and South Carolina’s during Hurricane Florence.In preparation for the storm, President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency in 35 Florida counties and said that 2,000 National Guard members were mobilized to assist with the preparation and recovery efforts.Scott again issued a dire warning to his state’s residents as the hurricane took aim at the Florida Panhandle, saying: ‘Water will come miles inshore and could easily be over the roofs of houses.‘You cannot hide from storm surge so get prepared and get out if an evacuation is ordered.‘Remember, we can rebuild your house, but we cannot rebuild your life.’ Who is Josh Radnor?

Musk raised eyebrows last month when he appeared on Joe Rogan\u0027s podcast and smoked weedThe SEC claimed Musk had not lined up backers and he\u0027d predicted the $420-per-share price based on a 20 per cent premium to the previous day\u0027s closing rate, because he thought this would be the typical uplift paid by a bidder taking a firm private. This calculation came out at $419.  The SEC alleges Musk upped it to $420 because the number is code in marijuana culture referring to the consumption of the drug, and he thought his girlfriend, Canadian singer Grimes, would find it funny.\u0027According to Musk, he calculated the $420 price per share based on a 20 per cent premium over that day\u0027s closing share price because he thought 20 per cent was a \u0027standard premium\u0027 in going-private transaction,\u0027 court documents submitted by the SEC said.\u0027This calculation resulted in a price of $419, and Musk stated that he rounded the price up to $420 because he had recently learned about the number\u0027s significance in marijuana culture and thought his girlfriend would find it funny, which admittedly is not a great reason to pick a price.\u0027           Musk is said to be advocating for Antonio Gracias (above), the founder of investment firm Valor Equity Partners, to take over the helm of the companyHe will be able to continue as the CEO of Tesla, but cannot be chairman again for three years. Musk will be solely responsible for paying his $20million fine.Tesla will have to pay a second $20million fine, and appoint two independent directors to replace Musk.  Musk said the SEC complaint was \u0027unjustified\u0027. \u0027This unjustified action by the SEC leaves me deeply saddened and disappointed,\u0027 he said.\u0027I have always taken action in the best interests of truth, transparency and investors. \u0027Integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way.\u0027 Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted or denied the SEC\u0027s findings as part of the settlement. Musk\u0027s legal dramas did not end with the settlement. The embattled tech whiz is also facing legal action from a British er who helped to rescue a soccer team of Thai boys when they became trapped in a cave.           The embattled tech whiz Musk is also facing legal action from a British er, Vernon Unsworth, who helped to rescue a soccer team of Thai boys when they became trapped in a cave.

Fredrick Farnsworth (left, outside Liverpool Magistrates\u0027 Court) has been jailed for 18 months after he admitted to being in charge of the dangerously out of control animals (shown right)Farnsworth claimed he did not even know the names of the dogs - one black and one beige - owned by a man called Mark who is in jail.Edmund Haygarth, prosecuting, said: \u0027The Crown would say foolishly and irresponsibly he took them out into the park without collars and without leads.\u0027The two boys were playing football in a caged area, in a park off Stapleton Avenue, at around 5pm, when the beige dog ran over and jumped up.Witnesses Shane Oosthuizen and Megan Herbert, who were walking their three dogs, saw the children try to climb onto a raised area to escape. Farnsworth slowly ran over to intervene but it was heroic Mr Oosthuizen who dragged the dogs off Lewis, before other people came to help. Farnsworth said he took the dogs home and locked them in his garage before going back to the park, but when he returned with police, they had gone.He confessed that the dogs had earlier ripped apart a football belonging to some other boys and he had paid them £10, before the second attack.The OAP told officers he heard Lewis screaming \u0027I think I\u0027m going to die\u0027, but refused to name the two people he initially said owned the animals.Mr Haygarth said: \u0027The families\u0027 anger and I think the anger of much of the community at large is the fact the dogs are still out there.\u0027The court heard the incident left Lewis scarred for life and both he and his friend psychologically damaged and requiring counselling.          The youngster was forced to make repeat visits to hospital for treatment, and even developed deadly sepsis from his wounds (pictured)Farnsworth had 12 previous convictions for 19 offences, the last in 1999, mostly for dishonesty and driving matters, but also assaults in the 1960s. Mr Rawson said: \u0027It was an offence brought about by his lack of foresight. He regrets it, he\u0027s upset about it and he\u0027s sorry.\u0027He said Farnsworth had parental responsibility for his 16 year-old grandson, but if he was jailed, his wife would look after the boy.Judge Woodhall said a man of Farnsworth\u0027s age and ill health was never going to be able to control the dogs and by the time he intervened it was \u0027too little, too late\u0027.  He said: \u0027You claimed to not know where they had gone. I don\u0027t accept that. You know full well where those dogs are and you\u0027re refusing to assist the authorities in finding them.\u0027What if it was your 16-year-old grandson? What message would it send to you and the public if the person responsible did nothing to ensure the dogs could be found?\u0027Judge Woodhall noted that in a pre-sentence report Farnsworth said he would rather spend time in prison than place his grandson at risk by naming the dogs\u0027 owner.He said: \u0027It seems you\u0027re in effect condoning what happened - putting other members of the public at risk of serious injury.\u0027The judge ordered the destruction of the dogs and banned Farnsworth from keeping dogs indefinitely.Unrepentant Farnsworth showed no emotion as he was jailed for 18 months.OAP refuses to help police find dogs that mauled 11-year-old in horrific attack - Liverpool Echo"},{"url":null,"title":"Pictured 15 men Turkish authorities looking quiz Saudi journalists disappearance","story":"Meshal Saad M Albostani (left), Salah Muhammad A Tubaigy (center), and Muhammed Saad H.

If the forensic team are allowed in they know exactly where to go’.Khashoggi had arrived at the consulate in Istanbul shortly after 1pm on Oct 2nd to collect papers showing he was orced in Saudi Arabia and free to marry his fiance the next day.Half an hour before he turned up the local Turkish staff working at the embassy were told to take the rest of the day off because a high-level diplomatic meeting was planned for the afternoon.The source told MEE that Khashoggi was greeted by an official and led straight to Mr al-Otaiba’s room .Shortly afterwards two men arrived, dragging the 59-year-old off into another room where they killed him., it was claimedIt’s not known how the journalist was killed, but the body was then taken to a third room where it was dismembered.It’s understood the Turkish prosecutor general is now deliberating whether to dig up Mr al-Otaiba’s garden, to see whether Khashoggi’s remains were buried there.This is because one of the 22 vehicles registered to the consulate left the building at 3.15pm and went 200 metres to the address.The Turkish authorities are believed to have audio and video evidence of the killing but it’s not known how they got it.But, it seems unlikely Saudi Arabia would allow Turkish officials to dig up the garden at the consul.  Naif Hassan S. Alarifi (left) Turki Musharraf M. Alsehri (center) and Khaled Aedh G. Altaibi (right) were also named by Turkish newspaper SabahTurkish officials believe Khashoggi may have been murdered and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and then taken out of the country by private jet.However, a Saudi source told Reuters that British intelligence believed there had been an attempt to drug Khashoggi inside the consulate that culminated in an overdose. He said the information came from a British intelligence source. Investigators are confident they may yet discover Khashoggi\u0027s fate despite their ban from the consulate, using data collected from his Apple Watch - which was connected to a phone he left outside with his fiancee.\u0027We have determined that it was on him when he walked into the consulate,\u0027 the security official said. Investigators are trying to determine what information the watch transmitted.\u0027Intelligence services, the prosecutor\u0027s office and a technology team are working on this. Turkey does not have the watch so we are trying to do it through connected devices,\u0027 he said.Tech experts say an Apple Watch can provide data such as location and heart rate. But what investigators can find out depends on the model of watch, whether it was connected to the internet, and whether it is near enough an iPhone to synchronize.  Waleed Abdullah M.

Ten stayed at the five-star Mövenpick hotel, which boasts 249 luxury rooms and a ballroom. It is located just 650 yards from the Saudi embassy where Mr Khashoggi vanished.The remaining five checked in to the Wyndham Grand hotel, another five-star establishment 15 minutes\u0027 walk to the south, in the direction of the airport. The men, believed to hold Saudi passports, reportedly flew into Turkey on a number of different flights. Two members, Mansur Othman M Abahuseyin, 46, and Khaled Aedh G Altaibi, 30, arrived on two different commercial flights.   Maher Abdulaziz M. Mutreb (left) Fahad Shabib A.

One man, Said Saad Q Alqahtani, 45, flew out using a commercial carrier.This morning, MailOnline pictured a black van with green diplomatic number plates, which has been at the centre of the investigation, outside the Saudi embassy.The van was seen on CCTV being loaded with boxes, which police believe may have been used to transport Khashoggi\u0027s remains to the airport.The van\u0027s diplomatic status is believed to render it immune to the investigation. Officials said it was part of a convoy of six cars, several with diplomatic number plates, which left the consulate grounds two hours after Khashoggi went inside.Turkish police were allowed into the building on Tuesday, a week after Khashoggi vanished, and said that CCTV footage from inside has gone missing and Turkish staff were abruptly told to take a holiday on the day in question.Yesterday, a source close to the Saudi royal family told DailyMail.com that the Washington Post writer, and long-standing critic of Saudi Arabia, is alive and being held captive in his home country after being flown to Riyadh in a private jet.According to the source, after entering the embassy Khashoggi was taken in a black Mercedes S-500 and a white minivan with four Saudi officials to Istanbul airport, where he was flown on a private jet to Riyadh and is now being held.Flight records show that a Gulf Stream IV private jet, tail number HZ-SK2, landed in Istanbul at 3am on October 2, the day Khashoggi disappeared.

Khashoggi was driven from there to Riyadh, and was held there, the source said.The source was told Khashoggi is still alive, contradicting the claims he was murdered in the Istanbul embassy.Turkish police also revealed they are seeking information about a black Mercedes van on Monday in connection with Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance.  WhatsApp records show Khashoggi last viewed his messages on his US cell phone at 1.06pm on Tuesday, around the time he entered the embassy. On Monday President Trump said that he was \u0027concerned\u0027 about reports on Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance.\u0027I am concerned about that,\u0027 Trump said. \u0027I don\u0027t like hearing about it and hopefully that will sort itself out. Right now, nobody knows anything about it.\u0027\u0027There\u0027s some pretty bad stories about it. I do not like it,\u0027 he added.Saudi Arabia\u0027s ambassador to the US, Prince Khalid bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, said claims Khashoggi had been killed or detained by Saudi authorities were \u0027absolutely false, and baseless,\u0027 according to a statement provided to CNN.          CCTV footage obtained from Turkish news agency DHA shows a Saudi team suspected of involvement in Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance on October 2          A security guard waits to enter Saudi Arabia\u0027s consulate in Istanbul today, a week after Khashoggi went missing after entering the building          A woman holds a portrait of missing journalist and Riyadh critic Jamal Khashoggi during a demonstration in front of the embassy yesterday\u0027There are many facts regarding his whereabouts that will hopefully be revealed through the ongoing investigation.\u0027Despite that, we have seen over the last few days various malicious leaks and grim rumors flying around about Jamal\u0027s whereabouts and fate,\u0027 the statement says.\u0027I assure you that the reports that suggest that Jamal Khashoggi went missing in the Consulate in Istanbul or that the Kingdom\u0027s authorities have detained him or killed him are absolutely false, and baseless.\u0027Earlier Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Saudi Arabia needs to prove that Khashoggi has, in fact, left the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\u0027He entered the general consulate himself, and if he has entered by himself and if he did not exit it, of course this should be proven by the general consulate,\u0027 said Erdogan at a press conference in Budapest.According to the Washington Post, who Khashoggi worked for as a contributor, US intelligence had previously intercepted communications from Saudi officials discussing plans to capture him.According to the Post\u0027s source, the intercepted material featured a discussion for the potential capture of Khashoggi - a longstanding critic of the Saudi government.          Turkish TV channel TRT also revealed images of the private jet which allegedly ferried the men in and out of Turkey          Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt (pictured) warned Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance on Wednesday afternoonThe source claimed US officials found out Saudi agents planned to lure Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia - although it was not clear whether they wanted to arrest and interrogate Khashoggi or to kill him from the information gathered.It is also not known whether the United States warned Khashoggi that he was a target, the source said.Saudi officials denied reports they sent a 15-man team to Istanbul on the day Khashoggi disappeared, saying that the only team they sent to Turkey consisted of investigators who arrived Saturday to help find the journalist.Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt issued a stark warning to Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance on Wednesday afternoon.\u0027Just met the Saudi ambassador to seek urgent answers over Jamal Khashoggi,\u0027 he said in a tweet,\u0027 Violence against journalists worldwide is going up \u0026amp is a grave threat to freedom of expression.\u0027\u0027If media reports prove correct, we will treat the incident seriously - friendships depend on shared values.\u0027He discussed the episode with the permanent secretary to the Foreign Office, Sir Simon McDonald, on Monday.Hunt also spoke with the Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir, for the first time raising the issue at ministerial level.          The former government adviser, pictured outside the BBC in London, has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since last year to avoid possible arrest.He interviewed Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan before al-Qaida was formed, then met him in Sudan in 1995. Following bin Laden\u0027s rise likely helped cement Khashoggi\u0027s ties with powerful former Saudi spy chief, Turki Al-Faisal.Khashoggi rubbed shoulders with the Saudi royal family and supported efforts to nudge the kingdom\u0027s entrenched ultra-conservative clerics to accept reforms. He served as an editor for nine years on the Islamist-leaning al-Madina newspaper and was frequently quoted in the Western media as an expert on Islamic radicals and a reformist voice.However, he was fired from his post as an editor at Al-Watan, a liberal paper founded after the 911 terror attacks, just two months after he took the job in 2003. The country\u0027s ultra-conservative clerics had pushed back against his criticism of the powerful religious police and Ibn Taymiyah, a medieval cleric viewed as the spiritual forefather of Wahhabism, the conservative interpretation of Islam that is the founding tenant of the kingdom.Khoshaggi then served as media adviser to Al-Faisal, the former spy chief, who was at the time the ambassador to the United States.Khashoggi returned to Al-Watan in 2007, where he continued his criticism of the clerics as the late King Abdullah implemented cautious reforms to try to shake their hold. Three years later, he was forced to resign again after a series of articles criticizing Salafism, the ultra-conservative Sunni Islam movement from which Wahhabism stems.In 2010, Saudi billionaire Alwaleed bin Talal tapped him to lead his new TV station, touted as a rival to Qatari-funded Al-Jazeera, a staunch critic of the kingdom. But the new Al-Arab station, based in Bahrain, was shut down hours after it launched, for hosting a Bahraini opposition figure.Khoshaggi\u0027s final break with the Saudi authorities followed the Arab Spring protests that swept through the region in 2011, shaking the power base of traditional leaders and giving rise to Islamists, only to be followed by unprecedented crackdowns on those calling for change. Siding with the opposition in Egypt and Syria, Khashoggi became a vocal critic of his own government\u0027s stance there and a defender of moderate Islamists, which Riyadh considered an existential threat.\u0027This was a critical period in Arab history. I had to take a position. The Arab world had waited for this moment of freedom for a thousand years,\u0027 Khashoggi told a Turkey-based Syrian opposition television station last month, just days before he disappeared.He also criticized his government\u0027s diplomatic break with Qatar and war on Yemen as well as Riyadh\u0027s policy toward its archenemy, Iran, whose influence has grown in neighboring Yemen and in Syria.In the Sept. 23 interview, he called Saudi Arabia\u0027s foreign policy \u0027narrow minded,\u0027 and ridiculed its crackdown on political Islam, urging the kingdom to realign its policy to partner with Turkey, a close Qatar ally.\u0027Saudi is the mother and father of political Islam. It is based on political Islam,\u0027 Khoshaggi said. \u0027The only recipe to get Iranians out of Syria - it is not Trump or anyone else- it is through the support of the Syrian revolution. ... Saudi Arabia must return to supporting the Syrian revolution and partnering with Turkey on this.\u0027Eight days later, on October 2, he disappeared while on a visit to the consulate in Istanbul for paperwork to marry his Turkish fiancee. The consulate insists the writer left its premises alive, contradicting Turkish officials.Before his disappearance, Khoshaggi had been living since last year in the U.S. in self-imposed exile, after he fled the kingdom amid a crackdown on intellectuals and activists who criticized policies of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.\u0027As of now, I would say Mohammed bin Salman is acting like Putin. He is imposing very selective justice,\u0027 Khashoggi wrote in the Post last year after he fled the kingdom, saying he feared returning home.He described \u0027dramatic\u0027 scenes of arrest of government critics accused of receiving Qatari funding. They included a friend of Khashoggi\u0027s who had just returned from a trip to the U.S. as part of an official Saudi delegation.\u0027That is how breathtakingly fast you can fall out of favor with Saudi Arabia,\u0027 he wrote.                                   Police CCTV video made available through Turkish Newspaper Sabah allegedly shows suspects wandering near the consulate on Tuesday          One of the black Mercedes vans at the center of the operation was shown on CCTV leaving the consulate on Tuesday afternoon          Tawakkol Karman, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate for 2011 holds a picture of missing Saudi writer Jamal KhashoggiEconomist and citizen-journalist Essam al-Zamel was put on trial this month for criticising the government\u0027s economic strategy in a series of tweets and reports.

The Belfast bakers refused to make a cake decorated with the words \u0027Support Gay Marriage\u0027\u0027It is deeply humiliating, and an affront to human dignity, to deny someone a service because of that person\u0027s race, gender, disability, sexual orientation, religion or belief. But that is not what happened in this case.\u0027She went on: \u0027As to Mr Lee\u0027s claim based on sexual discrimination, the bakers did not refuse to fulfil his order because of his sexual orientation. They would have refused to make such a cake for any customer, irrespective of their sexual orientation.\u0027LGBTQ children and teens are at a three-fold higher risk of...Gay and transgender students and teachers could be turned...Share this articleThe court also said Mr Lee had no claim against Ashers on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion.Lady Hale added: \u0027The bakers could not refuse to supply their goods to Mr Lee because he was a gay man or supported gay marriage.    Ashers general manager Daniel McArthur said outside court: \u0027I want to start by thanking God. He has been with us during the challenges of the last four years. Through the Bible and the support of Christians, He has comforted us and sustained us. He is our rock and all His ways are just.\u0027We\u0027re delighted and relieved at today\u0027s ruling. We always knew we hadn\u0027t done anything wrong in turning down this order. After more than four years, the Supreme Court has now recognised that and we\u0027re very grateful. Grateful to the judges and especially grateful to God.\u0027We\u0027re particularly pleased the Supreme Court emphatically accepted what we\u0027ve said all along – we did not turn down this order because of the person who made it, but because of the message itself.\u0027The judges have given a clear signal today. In fact it couldn\u0027t be any clearer. Family businesses like ours are free to focus on giving all their customers the best service they can – without being forced to promote other people\u0027s campaigns.\u0027I know a lot of people will be glad to hear this ruling today, because this ruling protects freedom of speech and freedom of conscience for everyone.\u0027On behalf of my family can I say thank you to everyone who has supported us or prayed for us through all this.\u0027I do want to take this opportunity to thank our whole legal team for working so hard for us over the last four years. And also to thank the entire Christian Institute staff for their help and support from the very beginning.\u0027We want to move on from this now, and I\u0027m sure Mr Lee does too. And let me just finish by saying that he will always be welcome at any of our shops. Thank you\u0027.Mr Lee was also present for the latest ruling in a case which has attracted enormous attention.The bakery\u0027s appeal against the finding of discrimination was heard at the Supreme Court sitting in Belfast in May.During the hearing the justices were told that the owners were being forced to act against their religious beliefs.David Scoffield QC, for Ashers, argued that the state was penalising the baking firm, with the courts effectively compelling or forcing them to make a cake bearing a message with which they disagree as a matter of religious conscience.Speaking outside court, Mr McArthur said: \u0027We\u0027re delighted and relieved at today\u0027s ruling. We always knew we hadn\u0027t done anything wrong in turning down this order. \u0027After more than four years, the Supreme Court has now recognised that and we\u0027re very grateful.

Daniel McArthur said outside court that \u0027a lot of people will be glad to hear this ruling today\u0027Mounting an unsuccessful challenge at the Court of Appeal in Belfast in 2016, Ashers contended that it never had an issue with Mr Lee\u0027s sexuality, rather the message he was seeking to put on the cake.Now share your opinionMr Scoffield told the justices that the case, a simple transaction, raised an issue of principle since those with deeply-held religious or philosophical convictions could be compelled to act against their beliefs.Robin Allen QC, for Mr Lee, said: \u0027This was a relatively small incident in his life which has become enormously significant and continues to be so. That is a heavy burden to bear for one inidual.\u0027Speaking outside court, Mr Lee said: \u0027To me, this was never about a campaign or a statement. All I wanted was to order a cake in a shop that sold cakes to order.\u0027I paid my money, my money was taken and then a few days later it was refused. That made me feel like a second-class citizen.\u0027I\u0027m concerned not just for the implications for myself and other gay people, but for every single one of us.\u0027Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK or Ireland where same-sex marriage is outlawed, with Prime Minister Theresa May\u0027s DUP allies staunch opponents of changing the law.Following the ruling,  DUP leader Arlene Foster said the judgment was \u0027historic and seminal\u0027, adding: \u0027This has been a long journey for everyone involved in the case. \u0027I commend Amy \u0026amp Daniel McArthur for their grace and perseverance. This now provides clarity for people of all faiths and none.\u0027          The UK Supreme Court has today released its judgment regarding the widely-reported \u0027gay cake\u0027 case.In 2014, a gay man and activist, Gareth Lee, made an order to Ashers Bakery in Belfast for a cake to have a message \u0027Support Gay Marriage\u0027 in icing, together with an image of Sesame Street\u0027s Bert and Ernie. The bakery refused to fulfil Mr Lee\u0027s order, explaining that they were a Christian business and could not print the message, and a full refund was given.Mr Lee brought proceedings against Ashers for direct discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, and the Belfast County Court awarded £500 as damages. This decision was upheld by the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal.Ashers appealed, and the Supreme Court has ruled that the bakery did not commit direct discrimination against Mr Lee. In an important clarification of the concept of \u0027direct discrimination\u0027, it must be shown that an inidual has been treated less favourably because of a protected characteristic, which in this case was Mr Lee\u0027s sexual orientation. In this case, no evidence was shown that Mr Lee was treated less favourably because he was gay, and Ashers objected only to the message being requested. Had Mr Lee not been gay but requested the same message, Ashers would have again refused, so there was no less favourable treatment linked to Mr Lee\u0027s sexual orientation. Rather than the inidual messenger, it was the message Ashers was found to have discriminated against, which was not unlawful. Lady Hale stated that \u0027the bakers could not refuse to supply their goods to Mr Lee because he was a gay man or supported gay marriage, but that is quite different from obliging them to supply a cake iced with a message with which they profoundly disagreed.\u0027This judgment clarifies the narrow scope of direct discrimination.There must be evidence that an inidual\u0027s own protected characteristic was the reason for the less favourable treatment. Interestingly, had Mr Lee been a disabled person, and been refused a cake with a message supporting disability rights, it is arguably this would amount to \u0027discrimination arising from disability\u0027 and would be unlawful under the Equality Act, as it would be unfavourable treatment because of something arising in consequence of the inidual\u0027s disability. However, this broader concept of protection is only available to disabled persons. Other protected characteristics, like sexual orientation, gender, race and age can only rely on the narrower concept of direct discrimination, the limits of which have been starkly highlighted by the Supreme Court.Christian bakery wins appeal in Supreme Court \u0027gay cake\u0027 case"},{"url":null,"title":"Passengers help screaming man kicked plane resists deported Somalia","story":"    Result: The man was eventually removed from the Turkish Airlines flight at Heathrow Airport, after passengers demanded that he be taken off the plane In the footage a number of riled up passengers shout to \u0027take him off the plane\u0027 and a number others turn from their seats to start filming the confrontation.One passenger points out the man being deported says he is going to Mogadishu in Somalia and the officer responds: \u0027And you believe him?\u0027In another incident a passenger claims that people die in Mogadishu, the official responds: \u0027They die in London, sir.\u0027The Home Office worker then tells passengers he has been to Mogadishu several times and it was \u0027all right\u0027.

They allegedly arrived in Istanbul on board at least two private jets in the early hours of October 2 and checked into two five-star hotels – the Movenpick and the Wyndham.CCTV released by Turkish TV showed a man believed to be Mr Khashoggi enter the consulate as well as a vehicle entering and leaving the building after he went inside. Footage also showed some of the Saudis arriving in Istanbul.It is said some of the men went into the Saudi consulate before Mr Khashoggi.

All we needed was a piece of paper.’Miss Cengiz said Mr Khashoggi had visited the consulate on September 28 despite some concern that he could be in danger.She wrote: ‘Although his opinions had angered certain people, he said, the tensions between himself and Saudi Arabia did not amount to hate, grudges or threats.‘He was, however, increasingly worried about an unprecedented wave of arrests in his country.’She said he did not think the Saudis could force him to stay at the consulate, adding: ‘He did not believe that something bad could happen on Turkish soil. After a positive first meeting with consular staff, who welcomed him warmly and assured him that the necessary paperwork would come through, Jamal was hardly concerned ahead of his second visit.‘He walked into the consulate of Saudi Arabia, his native country, without doubting he would be safe there. But after three hours I was overcome with fear and concern.’She went in to ask where he was but was told he had left without her noticing. ‘Although my hope slowly fades away each passing day, I remain confident that Jamal is still alive,’ she added.

A drawing from the 19th century shows slaves aboard a slave shipUnder Tony Blair, the last Labour government introduced the academies programme, which gives schools freedom from local authority control. This was used to turn around sink schools in deprived areas and challenge the idea of the \u0027bog standard comprehensive\u0027.The Tories hugely expanded this programme and introduced free schools, which can be set up by parents. Mr Hinds will say the reforms have improved failing schools and by abandoning them, Labour is choosing \u0027Left-wing dogma\u0027 over standards. He will accuse the Opposition of \u0027attacking success and defending failure\u0027.\u0027Labour saw the evidence,\u0027 he will say in a speech at the British Library. \u0027They had a choice between what is working for children and what Left-wing dogma says. They have made their choice.

What message would it send to you and the public if the person responsible did nothing to ensure the dogs could be found?\u0027Judge Woodhall noted that in a pre-sentence report Farnsworth said he would rather spend time in prison than place his grandson at risk by naming the dogs\u0027 owner.He said: \u0027It seems you\u0027re in effect condoning what happened - putting other members of the public at risk of serious injury.\u0027The judge ordered the destruction of the dogs and banned Farnsworth from keeping dogs indefinitely.Unrepentant Farnsworth showed no emotion as he was jailed for 18 months.OAP refuses to help police find dogs that mauled 11-year-old in horrific attack - Liverpool Echo"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19936d1bbd44771c9c75cb10ab46bc39ee4dcbbe/0_302_4500_2699/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fcbb7ea8e07119e778bbc60caf0493c","title":"athi patra ruga best photograph black queer women south africa","story":"‘I’ve seen the zebra since this shoot – in a TV advert and then at a beach party. He has a life of his own!’This image is part of my Future White Women of Azania series. Azania is the utopia I’ve created. Populated by a pantheon of recurring characters, it is the story of black queer women in South Africa. On the right, you have the Flower of Azania, wearing a costume made from 250 sunhats. The two figures to the left, holding sceptres, are the faceless abo dade (sisters). They have the ability to make babies, not by having sex with men, but by just thinking about it.The rider is the Future White Woman of Azania, a character born in 2008 who I have performed many times. Here, though, we needed someone jockey-light to mount the zebra and in 2014 when I made his image, I was quite a big boy, so we went with someone else. I come from a fashion background. Growing up, I used to buy a lot of magazines that I’d tear up, then stick the images on the wall. I always create everything from scratch – there is no digital post-production in my work.For this particular image I wanted to create a quasi-funereal procession, with pomp and fanfare. I decorated the zebra a bit like a holy cow in India, or a Spanish horse, or a dressage champion, giving it sabre teeth and custom-made accessories.At first we were looking to get a live zebra and then, in a studio where I was having my body cast for a sculpture, I found this taxidermied one. Sadly, I had to give him back after the shoot. I’ve since seen him in a TV advert, and once, at a beach party. He has a life all of his own!We sourced funeral wreaths from all over Cape Town – plastic flowers, porcelain flowers – that we then stitched on to nets. We turned the light down to make it cold and blue, and hung a large piece of chintzy fabric as the background. I liked that it looked like a cross between the galaxy and an English garden.As much as my utopia is inspired by my own black, queer story – and all of my work is in some way autobiographical – I like to remove both skin and faces. I think people presume that they understand a person’s story just from their skin.The phrase also refers to the paranoid rightwing conspiracy theory that Mandela’s death would precipitate a retaliation they called die nag van die lang messe. Of course, when Mandela did die, this didn’t happen. This scene is both a procession and a pantomime. I wanted camp and sarcasm: “This is us, we’re about to go do a purge, can you believe us?” It is a play on that unfounded settler panic, because we’re not killing each other. We are steamrolling ahead towards progress instead. This image has done wonders for both my studio’s bank account and for South African art. It’s part of the permanent collection at the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa in Cape Town. Seeing black children standing in front of it, looking up in wonder at a person riding a zebra, is a beautiful thing. The image stands two metres tall – the kids are right there with the animal! I want to embrace every South African under this one image and know there is no reason to panic.

As the RIBA’s president, Ben Derbyshire, put it, the architects “have not just raised the bar for office design and city planning, but smashed the ceiling”.It is the kind of no-expense-spared statement you might expect from its billionaire client, Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, the author of Climate of Hope, and the boss of this financial software, data and media empire. It is an elaborate monument to his belief that “businesses have a role to play in saving the planet”.As grand corporate gestures go, it does its best to be demure. “Many companies of our size would have opted for a glass skyscraper,” Bloomberg said at the building’s opening, “but we place value on being good neighbours. We are conscious of the fact we are guests in London.” An earlier scheme for the site, designed by Foster for a different client, imagined a dark glass tower rising to 22 storeys, capped with a domed hat, earning it the nickname “Darth Vader’s helmet”.Bloomberg’s vision is a squatter affair of two 10-storey blocks either side of a new arcade (lined with food outlets selected by Bloomberg’s food critic), connected by a bridge and dressed in a polite costume of sandstone and bronze. Standing across from Foster’s bulbous glass Walbrook building, it shows just how willing the architect is to turn his hand to whatever the client wants.The visitor experience is meticulously choreographed like few other corporate HQs. You arrive into “the vortex”, a lobby of swirling timber shells, with a feeling of walking into a Richard Serra sculpture, from where cantilevered glass lifts whisk you up to the sixth-floor “pantry” – a staff breakout area conceived on the scale of an airport terminal. This voluminous “greeting, relaxing, collaborating space” is flanked by fish tanks and vast windows framing views of St Paul’s cathedral, as if captured in a vitrine for the 4,000 Bloomberg staff who work here, 700 to a floor.Employees’ fields of flexible workstations are connected by a great bronze ramp that coils through the floors, providing a possibility for chance encounter, where workers might exchange bon mots of financial reporting on their way to the wellness centre. It is a hive of “collaboration and teamwork”, illuminated by a dazzling ceiling of 2.5m folded aluminium petals that twinkle with LED lights, adding an air of Bloombergian razzmatazz to the corporate scene.Secreted “voice lift” microphones in the auditorium and meeting rooms isolate and amplify speakers’ voices so that everyone may be heard, while the oak floorboards are fixed to magnetic plates so they can be lifted to access the services below. The big gills serve to draw in natural air, with flaps that open and close automatically, allowing the building to breathe, while softening traffic noise from outside.All of these innovations underwent relentless refinement and optimisation at a dedicated test facility in Battersea, where the natural ventilation system was modelled with water by fluid-dynamics experts, and 1:1 mock-ups regularly examined by Bloomberg himself, in a rare level of hands-on involvement. “Some people say the reason it took almost a decade to build this is because we had a billionaire who wanted to be an architect,” quipped Bloomberg, “working with an architect who wanted to be a billionaire.”But for all their trailblazing innovations, it is hard to escape the feeling of being trapped in a very deep-plan office building, very far from a window, with views to the outside world often obscured by the big bronze baffles. It is a very inward-looking place, lest employees be distracted from their duties to planet Bloomberg. The incorporation of the Roman Temple of Mithras in the basement might make some uneasy about the company’s ambitious level of “stewardship”, while the 600 tonnes of bronze imported from Japan and the quarry-full of granite from India also make you wonder about the project’s true environmental credentials.It marks the third time that Norman Foster’s practice has won the Stirling prize, having previously taken the accolade for the elliptical hangar of the Imperial War Museum, Duxford, in 1998 and the magnificent Gherkin in 2004. Bloomberg was the favourite to win, at 3:1 odds, and it shouldn’t be a surprise: the prize is explicitly awarded to the building that makes “the biggest contribution to the evolution of architecture”, and Foster’s high-tech innovations will no doubt influence the future of office design.The Bloomberg European headquarters triumphed over the Tate’s magical new gallery in Cornwall, Bushey’s Jewish cemetery, some fine student accommodation for the University of Roehampton, a jewel-like arts building for Worcester College, Oxford, and – my favourite – an inventive nursery and community hall in Cambridge, by Muma, that does a lot with a modest budget.It couldn’t be further than last year’s winner, Hastings pier, a community-led project that tragically went into administration shortly after the prize was awarded, and was sold to a private hotelier for a fraction of the cost of its renovation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97c2518c102c25ca992a6361228b19cd64a6895f/0_191_3488_2093/master/3488.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d07b018346e0d587d47e8031a1dc8e06","title":"life times very british man kamal ahmed review enoch powell","story":"“When did you first realise you were white?” I once mischievously asked a friend. She was initially stumped. Until then she had never considered it she’d never had to. That innocence is a luxury denied to people of colour in the UK. Kamal Ahmed has long known that he was brown, but it took the elevation of Barack Obama in 2008 before the BBC’s economics editor, soon to be its editorial director of news, felt comfortable enough to tick the identity box marked “mixed”.Ahmed was born in England to a white English mother and black Sudanese father. But he is not English definitely not. Ahmed identifies as British because, he writes, the term “‘English’ has been manipulated to suggest, with its flags of St George and cricket tests, something far more racially distinct” and “exclusive”.Like the authors Afua Hirsch and Akala, whose memoirs focus on an identity semi-detached from Britain, Ahmed inhabits a curious state that the African American scholar WEB Du Bois once described as double consciousness. Black people felt a “two-ness ... two warring ideals in one dark body”. What Du Bois describes is even more pronounced perhaps when one parent is white.Early in the book, Ahmed, who was raised in London in the 1970s, gives us a schoolboy’s perspective on racism as a thing, like acne, to be ignored: maybe it would just go away. Yet his recollections confidently refer to “us” and “we”, meaning the British people – words written by the dutiful son of a public-spirited, trend-setting mother, who happened to fall in love with a black man.The writing is full of charm. He remembers his maternal grandmother, who cut bread “so thinly you could almost see the light through each slice”, and, as a sensitive 10-year-old boy, being so unsettled by the Arabic name Kamal that he told strangers he was called Neil. His new brogues, he writes, gave him an advantage in street fights. There is much modesty here, yet publishing a memoir is necessarily an act of arrogance, and a man whose elbows are sharp enough – as well as his talent obvious enough – to be promoted to the editorial director of news surely knows he has risen above the ranks of the ordinary.There are intriguing omissions in the book. Ahmed was brought up by a single parent (his mother) but will not be drawn on the strains that led to his parents’ orce. “It is always difficult to explain why marriages break up, and that is not a subject to detail here.” It’s his prerogative, but for a work reflecting on race and identity it is perhaps pertinent. In his poem “Digging”, Seamus Heaney conjures the power of the pen as a tool of excavation, but mostly Ahmed eschews the personal for the general and political. It could be that as a journalist and broadcaster he is discomfited by the inaccuracy of memory or absence of facts.Earlier this year the BBC got itself into a pickle when it broadcast a dramatic rendition of Enoch Powell’s “Rivers of Blood” speech (on its 50th anniversary), a flawed decision compounded by the producers’ decision to employ an actor to mimic the delivery and cadences of Powell. In a chapter entitled “Preventable Evil”, which includes parts of Powell’s rant, Ahmed attempts his own interrogation of the speech and makes a better fist of it than his colleagues. He meets Powell’s biographer, who highlights his subject’s unbridled criticism of the British authorities for the death in 1959 of Mau Mau detainees at the Hola prison camp in Kenya as evidence of Powell’s non-discrimination. Ahmed concludes that though Powell the man might not have been straightforwardly racist, his famous speech undoubtedly was.Still, Ahmed has faith in “us”. He draws unashamedly on nostalgic notions of British fair play and the “gentleness of English civilisation”, as espoused by George Orwell in “The Lion and the Unicorn”. Ugly manifestations of fascism, such as the goose-step, could never take root in Britain, Orwell wrote, because “people in the street would laugh”. Ahmed argues that just because fascists aren’t parading around giving salutes, it “shouldn’t be taken as permission from the political classes to ignore the factors that allow extremism to flourish”. Perhaps it is this drive to investigate underlying factors that has led to the BBC giving an extraordinary amount of coverage to Nigel Farage.“Do they have censors in the BBC?” a character asks in David Caute’s 1986 novel News from Nowhere. “No,” is the sad reply, “they make you do it yourself.” Ahmed is a senior figure at the corporation. His ambition is to rise even higher. The exodus of high-profile black executives from the BBC in recent years demonstrates how tricky that path is. While this careful book will no doubt deepen the conversation on race and identity in Britain, it sometimes reads like an audition.• The Life and Times of a Very British Man is published by Bloomsbury Circus.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, some corrections. Tom Mooney has come to a new understanding of William Faulkner’s As I Lay Dying:When you’re wrong, you’re wrong. And I was completely wrong about William Faulkner. As I Lay Dying is a phenomenal book. I struggled like hell with Faulkner when I first tried him a few years ago but this time he sang to me and I heard every word. This tragic, rich, epic book is simply incredible.It’s been eight – nine years since I gave up on Thomas Mann’s The Magic Mountain – the only book other than The Power of Now (a rather bizarre choice of gift that I received) I’ve never finished. The fact The Magic Mountain is rated so highly by so many people only added to the sense of failure. I really couldn’t see how people had not only completed it, but enjoyed it.Then someone recommended John Woods’ translation to me and I cannot believe the contrast … it’s like reading a totally different book. The whole tone has changed – what was a dry and seemingly humourless book now has me sniggering away to myself. While still very wordy, it’s now a joy to read.Talking of wordy, sursumcorda has just “cracked open” A Small Boy and Others by Henry James:Well not exactly cracked open. I’ve put on my white gloves and reached for my lorgnette. This is a handsome volume from The Library of America, complete with silk bookmark, so serious face on here.James started writing this memoir at the behest of his sister-in-law, following the death of his beloved brother William. Wiilliam and Alice had travelled to England in some alarm at the state of Henry’s health but William died suddenly shortly after their return to Chocorua. (Don’t you love that place-name. I think Wallace Stevens loved it too.) Henry wrote to Alice in 1911: “The book I see \u0026amp feel will be difficult \u0026amp unprecedented \u0026amp perilous - but if I bring it off it will be exquisite and unique”.Henry’s health was still precarious - he died in 1916 - so this is a heartfelt labour of love.Sometimes, an immediate and “undemanding” read can be just as satisfying. Cookyhunter recommends Anthony Trollope’s Barchester Towers:I have been reading Trollope for months now (with forays into crime and children’s books every now and then). He’s just such a comfortable, undemanding, gentle read, and so funny, too! Right now I am deep in Barchester Towers. Everyone is convinced that Eleanor is keen on the hideous, unctuous Slope with his moist handshake and slithery cunning. Slope himself is battling Mrs Proudie over the control of the feeble bish. He’s also beguiled by the fascinating, amoral Madeleine and her sofa of sin. What a tonic!Ian Rankin’s Rebus novels have gripped BobHammond2:I’m going to an event with Ian Rankin in Manchester in a couple of weeks (my wife is a big fan) so have been working my way through the early Rebus novels in preparation. They are incredibly more-ish - I raced through the first three in a fortnight and am now gripped by the fourth, Strip Jack. Rebus seems like an irascible but endearing character with the obligatory troubled back story and home life.Meanwhile, Ellie Rose has found interesting parallels with Rebus in William McIlvanney’s Laidlaw trilogy:They are great reads, set in the seamy underbelly of 1970s Glasgow. Laidlaw is a policeman whose conscience won’t let him see the world in black and white, us and them, like some of his colleagues do, and you can see in him the template for some later obsessive cops (Rebus comes to mind). Unlike Rebus, though, his genuine affection for the drunks, down-and-outs and petty thieves of Glasgow is actually quite touching, and makes a change from the crime novel staple of the misanthropic detective.McIlvanney has a talent for a pithy sentence, too. Laidlaw hooked me on page nine with the sentence “His face was an argument you couldn’t win” and wouldn’t let me go until I finished the sequel, The Papers of Tony Veitch.The story of a DIY spy who plots to sell US secrets, if he can find any way to contact someone to sell them to. A man who creates secret messages using Renaissance-era cryptography, built up with tables of letters and keywords (the author’s explanation is most interesting), only to forget his own keywords from time to time.Sounds even tougher than online banking…Interesting links about books and readingIf you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us on : simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

However, rival publishers and interested parties are likely to focus on its most desirable assets.The i newspaper, which Johnston Press bought from the Independent and the Evening Standard owner, Evgeny Lebedev, for £24m in 2016, is considered to be its most valuable title. The newspaper has performed well since the acquisition and is on track to make up to £12m in profit this year, which would suggest a potential price tag of £60m.The i is likely to draw strong interest. When Lebedev quietly sounded out potential buyers for the title, Reach – the parent company of the Mirror and Express titles – expressed an interest but was not willing to pay the amount Johnston Press eventually stumped up. In an internal email, David King, Johnston Press’s chief executive, sought to reassure staff about the future of the business.“This process is about securing a positive future for Johnston Press,” he said. “In the meantime, it is business as usual. Johnston Press is a strong and resilient business with good profits and strong profit margins, great people and prestigious titles. I am certain that whatever the future ownership of the company, we will continue to produce our titles long after the end of the strategic review.” Johnston Press’s biggest shareholders include the activist fund Crystal Amber, run by Richard Bernstein, and Christen Ager-Hanssen, who last year looked to oust Johnston Press’s board in a plan involving the former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond.In May, Ashley Highfield, a former BBC and Microsoft senior executive, stepped down as chief executive of Johnston Press after seven years. The business is being run by King, who was previously chief financial officer.Johnston Press has struggled over the past decade to reduce a debt pile that stood at well over £400m built up from a string of acquisitions made before the arrival of Google and Facebook hammered the profitability of newspapers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de5aa945a92f5b33482aae86c7f43c211dbc764c/0_86_3204_1922/master/3204.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67f726fa5afb7fc5b047d811d0a1d1c7","title":"tell us how would a no deal brexit impact your business","story":"What issues do you anticipate for your business or sector should the UK leave the EU without a deal?Government ministers released a batch of papers in September warning of the risks of leaving the European Union without a deal.Impact papers stressed some of the day-to-day effects after Theresa May chaired a special meeting of the cabinet focused on how a no-deal outcome could be handled.We would like to hear from you if you work in a sector you think may be affected by a no-deal Brexit and to find out what the potential impact would mean for you.Tell us a little about what you do and how your reading of the situation means your business or sector could be affected in our encrypted form below.

Here, a social buzz breaks the quiet: men sit on low stone benches, or baraza, which are carved into the sides of many houses, and fan themselves and chat at night, the courtyards come alive with men laughing in the balmy night air, drinking cups of masala tea and watching football on fuzzy televisions, as hawkers sell juicy skewers of spiced meat. And yet, amid all the liveliness, there is just one thing missing. Women.But today, instead of women gathering to socialise and share problems, the grassy gardens of the Old Fort are filled with vendors hawking tourist trinkets. Across the city, economic development , led by tourism, has usurped the spaces where women once gathered.Munira Said, the coordinator for Reclaim Women’s Space, cites a variety of factors behind the retreat of women from the public sphere: a growing population, globalisation and immigration. “The space for economic activities overtook the needs of the women.”Reclaim Women’s Space is working to change that. Employing female engineers and conservators, the project aims to study public spaces, take back those that have been overrun, and create entirely new ones. It is attempting to physically alter Stone Town to give the city’s women a place to gather, and to empower them to work together.Public space that caters to women enriches their experience by allowing them to encounter different perspectives, says Madina Haji, one of the engineers involved in Reclaim Women’s Space. “If you go outside, you see a lot of things. You can open your mind. You can learn something,” she says. “You can make a friend. And a friend can help you just by sharing the idea … Alone, you have only one mind.”One of the first places the project created was a community centre near the Old Fort. A small house became a meeting place where women could socialise, gain skills and to discuss what changes might help improve their access to public space.The project draws on recollections of those older generations, using a technique called memory mapping. Women recall and then draw memories of their favourite places in Stone Town, past and present. Then they imagine the spaces they want for the future. The process has allowed the organisation to create and preserve records of womens’ spaces, while also connecting women from different generations. “We thought the best approach for the women, especially women in Zanzibar who like to tell stories, would be by telling their stories,” says Said. “But not just telling stories: telling stories to empower them.”Reclaim Women’s Space also runs skill classes, from crafting to stonemasonry and how to run a small business. One exercise takes women around town to look at shops, asking participants what businesses catches their eye, what they might be interested in pursuing, and how they would innovate on the male-dominated squares, given the chance. Haji and her team of engineers are also working to physically create new spaces that welcome women, particularly those with families. “We can’t force, but we produce room,” Haji says. That “room” is something many of us take for granted: playgrounds.“It’s rare to see the men take the kids and go to those places,” says Haji. “It’s mostly women ... the kids play, and the women sit and they talk and they eat.”Parks where women can simultaneously take care of their children and socialise are crucial in Stone Town, Said says. She explains that even as women have gained more education, and started to work more, they remain in charge of household duties.“Women have to go work, while at the same time they are still responsible for their homes,” she says. “Whereas the men, they will go to work and after that they have time for social gatherings.” “We want to empower women to stand on their own,” says Haji. “Maybe we can have a president called Aisha one day.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ebe8a734c1a90694a078d6f01186426e438b279/0_16_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=247cafcd90a6ea2cc35f6f8e0ec87c75","title":"ten years rbs toxic brand","story":"Looking back, there are two extraordinary aspects to what’s happened to RBS over the last 10 years. One is the new depths to which the bank has plummeted. It’s doubled down on the worst excesses of the pre-crisis period, faced multiple  investigations and has been mired in constant scandals. The second shocking fact is that the bank has done so under public ownership. The government has had the power to put a stop to RBS’s misdemeanours, but has chosen not to.This Saturday marks 10 years since the moment when the government became RBS’s majority shareholder, rescuing the bank from imminent collapse. Despite the fact that people are fed up with our self-serving banking system, and despite the taxpayer having a controlling stake in one of our biggest banks, we haven’t seen any significant change over the decade, just disappointment after disappointment. The story of RBS is the story of the UK’s broken banking system: banks get bailed out and the public gets sold out. It’s also a story of the failure to adequately punish those who oversaw reckless and greedy behaviour and brought the country to the brink 10 years ago.Seventy-two per cent of people think that banks should have faced more severe penalties for their role in the financial crisis. Fred “the Shred” Goodwin, the RBS boss who oversaw the horrendous practices leading to its collapse, now enjoys a £450,000 pension, and has received almost £6m since quitting a decade ago. After resigning in 2008, the worst penalty he faced was being stripped of his knighthood. How he deserved it in the first place is another conversation.Ten years ago, RBS was the world’s biggest bank, after Goodwin led it through a number of dodgy takeovers. Since its near-collapse, its legacy of bad practices and scandals have streamed into the public domain. Only this August, RBS was fined £3.9bn for deliberately selling mortgage packages pre-2008 that were “total fucking garbage”, according to the bank’s chief credit officer in the US. Probably the worst is the debacle of the RBS Global Restructuring Group. In this scandal, RBS was alleged to have deliberately pushed small businesses towards insolvency in order to shore up the bank’s own capital position, before in some cases stripping them of assets.The bank is currently presiding over a devastating programme of branch closures, adding to the more than 1,500 communities without a high-street bank. British banks such as RBS have a record of consistently failing to meet the needs of the UK economy, with the vast majority of their lending going towards speculation on property and other already-existing assets, and only a fraction going towards productive projects. As if that wasn’t bad enough, last week RBS boss Ross McEwan suggested that the bank has become even less willing to lend towards industries such as retail and construction. In doing so, it is denying the investment that could help save Britain’s struggling high streets and address the housing crisis.In rescuing RBS, the government has chosen to have ownership but not control – the bailout package of £45.5bn of taxpayer money came with no strings attached. Perhaps this was panic and lack of foresight. Regardless, with its majority stake in the company, the government could step in to rein in these excesses, and put the bank to use for the good of the public. But instead it’s opting to press ahead with privatisation, which could mean a loss for the taxpayer of over £26bn. There are even rumours that RBS wants to get sold back quickly to the private sector because it fears a general election and a Labour government. Indeed, Labour has signalled interest in a proposal to break it up and turn it into a network of smaller, regionally based banks.Perhaps that’s why this week chairman Howard Davies has suggested that RBS change its name it’s clearly still a toxic brand. There are many things that we need to change urgently about RBS: its behaviour, structure and mission, but a superficial name change will help with none of them. McEwan is right to recognise that the bank still needs to regain the trust of the British public. But unfortunately he’s taking the wrong approach to making amends. RBS needs to work in the interests of the British public – instead of closing branches, ripping off small businesses and lending for speculation, it should lead the way in banking by serving local communities and the real economy. The future of RBS can be seen as a key battleground for a public that wants to see a banking sector that actually works in their interests. We mustn’t let the government sell it off.• Fran Boait is executive director of campaign group Positive Money"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/793a03e2b5185ed672219321570083ba48a978ce/0_336_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cc07c0400bf1e26495fad276b9d3f85","title":"university technical colleges schools report education policy institute","story":"Education Policy Institute says UTCs – part of free schools changes – are ineffectiveUniversity technical colleges – part of the free schools changes pushed through by Michael Gove – have been described as ineffective and unpopular by a report that found more than half their students dropped out.Of those who remained at UTCs, many made poor progress, with even previously high-achieving students performing less well in their exams, according to the Education Policy Institute.About 60 UTCs have opened since 2011, after being championed by the Conservative Lord Baker and the then prime minister, David Cameron, enrolling students aged 14 to 18 and designed to encourage the study of science, technology and engineering.But despite official encouragement and lavish funding, they have failed to generate enthusiasm among parents, and 10 have subsequently closed or converted into conventional schools.David Laws, the EPI’s executive chairman, said after spending “hundreds of millions of pounds” on UTCs, the Department for Education (DfE) should halt any further expansion until their effectiveness has been reviewed.Baker, a former education secretary who chairs the Baker Dearing Trust, which promotes UTCs, accused EPI researchers of ignoring evidence.“EPI start with their conclusion that a 14-18 institution cannot fit into an 11-18 system and then use statistics to support that,” he said.“It is a pity that they did not take up Baker Dearing’s offer to visit several of our 50 UTCs and speak to teachers, students and parents.”The EPI found many UTCs struggled to recruit students, and failed to retain the majority of those who did enrol. More than half of all UTC students left between the ages of 16 and 17 after taking GCSEs, while more continued to quit before finishing key stage five at the age of 18.Julian Gravatt, the deputy chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said the report showed UTCs “are an experiment that hasn’t worked”.“Given the high level of support given to them by the DfE and the capital funding allocated by the Treasury, this is obviously depressing,” he said.The analysis also found UTC students’ GCSE results were almost a grade lower than their peers at secondary schools. “Significantly, this poor progress is particularly acute for high attainers, who make over a grade’s less progress than high attainers in all state-funded schools,” the EPI noted.The National Education Union said the report backed up its research, which found Black Country university technical college in Walsall cost more than £11m between its opening in 2011 and closure in 2015, with 158 students enrolled out of a planned 480.Another UTC in Burnley cost £10m but closed three years after opening in 2013, with 113 students enrolled despite plans for 800.The EPI did note several benefits from UTCs, including that they offer a wider range of technical subjects such as computer science than other schools.The report concluded that existing UTCs should be repurposed as 16-18 colleges offering post-GCSE technical qualifications, such as the government’s promised T-levels.But Gravatt warned such a change needs careful consideration. “The 16-to-18 sector of education is already a chaotic and underfunded market,” he said.A DfE spokesperson said UTCs were an important part of England’s erse education system.“Our most recent data shows that when young people leave a UTC, they are headed in the right direction – with twice as many key stage four students beginning an apprenticeship compared to the national average,” they said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0483f37174333d9c95daae6cb8a1eee97eecb7b2/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c3b0b24a0f8818b0a05eaaa2ae400ac","title":"goofy cds and dogwear our pick of the new hm x moschino collection","story":"Jeremy Scott’s designs are not to everyone’s taste, but if it is joyful silliness you are after, look no further than his new high street collaborationWith cartoon characters, teddy bears, Barbie and logos galore, it is fair to say Moschino’s Jeremy Scott is not for minimalists. He is a designer who appeals to a generation that requires pop art-like graphic statements in their bid to win at Instagram (it goes without saying that he has excellent emoji game).This sheer joy of his sensibility comes to the high street next month, with the MOSCHINO x H\u0026ampM capsule collection. Here are our five favourite pieces, guaranteed to bring a bit of Scott-patented fun to your wardrobe this winter.Scott loves Disney (Dumbo is appaz his favourite). That means loveable characters run amok in this collection. Goofy is a cult hero of the Disney universe and the appeal is doubled on this jumper that features a back print of him, too – as if he is running through your sweatshirt. A smile-worthy take on 360 degree fashion if ever there was one.Sure, you stream your music these days but what better way to pay homage to the 90s than by wearing a print of obsolete technology? The CD print appears on a crop top, swimsuit and long shirt in this collection. We like the latter for its extra-90s slouchy style. Wear with leggings to complete the look.Padded jackets are now so commonplace that fashion people have taken to bringing the trend to other items. See padded gloves, padded trousers (yes really) and this padded skirt. Save for cold days and – if you are really embracing the padded trend – combine with the cropped padded jacket that Scott has so kindly provided.The Moschino logo, created by founder Franco Moschino in the80s, is a classic – so it is rightly sprinkled liberally all over this collection. These earrings tick the logo-mania box by telling every passerby exactly who your earrings are by. They also fulfil the very 2018 need for a lobe-based fashion statement. Two birds and all that.If you are kitted out in your best H \u0026amp M x Moschino then your favourite pet should be too, right? Scott has provided two doggy hoodies – and we liked the dressed-down cool of this grey marl hoodie. If the concept of a small dog wearing clothes can ever be described as “dressed-down”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09d671685287f46250be04704a38215a1ba1c41a/1_0_3599_2159/master/3599.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2619089ae7ccb278b3ce7bfb51455a3f","title":"could you handle the worlds most long distance relationship","story":"The journey to becoming an astronaut requires extreme physical fitness and sky-high academic achievement. Much less documented, however, is the need for astronauts and their families to weather intense emotional strain. As Neil Armstrong biopic First Man explores, for those left at home, it is quite literally the world’s most long-distance relationshipIn 1966, three years before her husband, Neil, became the first person to walk on the moon, Janet Armstrong was pictured at home by Life magazine. Neil was in orbit in the Gemini 8 spacecraft, but it had started to spin dangerously out of control. Suddenly, his safe return was in doubt.At that moment, to protect Janet and the family from any bad news, Neil’s Nasa bosses restricted the family’s access to its live radio feed, known as the “squawk box”.Life magazine showed her kneeling in front of the device, as if praying for Neil’s safe return. In fact, she was furious. “I was on my knees there with my eyes closed trying to concentrate on what was being said,” she later explained. “But it came out that I was in a praying position and blah, blah, blah. Well, that’s not true.” Later, she would confront Nasa bosses and warn them not to pull a similar stunt again.It’s a small story, one of hundreds of tiny insights in the book First Man: The Life of Neil A Armstrong, which has now been adapted into a film. Small, but significant, as the psychological effects of being an astronaut, or the family of an astronaut, are rarely explored.In this instance, the mass media were camped in the living room of a mother of two living sons and one daughter, who died aged two from a brain tumour four years previously. The photographer is watching through the lens as Janet tries to establish whether she will ever see her husband again.While he’s certainly having a bad day at the office, it’s no picnic for the loved ones he left at home, either.“It can be harder for the ones left behind than the one doing it,” says psychotherapist Jennie Miller. “If you’re the one doing it, you have a sense of some control, of having been trained to do your level best to get back. With control we get a sense of being OK. It’s the difference between learning to drive a car and being a passenger. But if you’re the loved one, you have zero control.”Janet Armstrong was an intelligent, thoughtful woman whose frustration at her treatment by both Nasa and her husband occasionally pokes through even the sanitised Life magazine interviews conducted between 1966 and 1969.“People are always asking me what it is like to be married to an astronaut,” Janet told the magazine. “What it’s like for me to be the wife of Neil Armstrong is the more appropriate question.”In public, common with the other wives of astronauts, Janet maintained the wholesome picture-postcard image of the all-American family. In private, many of the wives felt like they didn’t have much say in what was going on. “We would meet over in the Nasa auditorium,” she is quoted as saying in First Man. “We would get all dressed up and we would have to put our gloves on to get, what I felt was, lectured: ‘Keep a stiff upper lip, girls.’”Why would Janet always be the one to confront authority? Perhaps, says psychotherapist Miller, the roots of her outspokenness lay in the premature death of her daughter, Karen Anne.“The impact of losing a child can sometimes affect people in remarkable ways. They think: ‘I’ve experienced the worst pain that life can throw at me, so I don’t give a damn what you think about me any more.’“I live and work near Portsmouth naval base, so I see couples who don’t see each other for 18 months, or even two years at a time. While they’re not going to the moon, it’s not that dissimilar. Even when an astronaut is home, with all the training and so on, I imagine their head is in a different place.”It’s a theory borne out by the recollections of astronaut Gene Cernan, the commander of Apollo 17, the last lunar mission.But could such problems be avoided, and how would an expert today prepare families for what lies ahead?“If you’re going to do work like that, you’d want to talk to someone before any training begins and prepare people for the impact on their lives,” Miller says. “If I were seeing a couple like this, I’d do empathy work with the pair of them, so they each get a sense of what it is like to be the other. In the case of the Armstrongs, he needs to realise that she’s lost a child, and she may now lose a husband in such a public way.”When a couple are facing a big challenge, what can happen is that each withdraws into themselves and they build up too solid a boundary in order to survive, in order not to be vulnerable. You need to make sure you let the right people in.”This one small step could be a giant leap.First Man is released nationwide on 12 October – book tickets here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bae30f616f41550d91d8cccd3ab4bf2abab730cc/0_825_4636_2782/master/4636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54c04fc6fd4c000c0b27e558d5d63e7c","title":"why the moon landing was a giant leap for mankind","story":"Forty-nine years after Neil Armstrong made history by becoming the first man to walk on the moon, new film First Man proves the event is still one of the most significant achievements of humanityNeil Armstrong was the first man on the moon and the master of the understatement. “It, you know, was a pretty simple statement, talking about stepping off something,” he later said when asked about his legendary first words on the lunar surface. “It was what it was.”Shrewdly chosen by Nasa to make that mission work – to troubleshoot unpredictable life and death situations on the fly and to represent not just America but the world – Armstrong was unquestionably the man for the job. Flying to the moon, landing and walking on it, let alone getting home safely, was man conquering the impossible. The stuff of dreams. Science fiction author Arthur C Clarke wrote that, from then on, history and fiction had “become inexorably linked”.Despite his humility, Armstrong had spent some time thinking of what he might say when he stepped on to the moon – he knew what it meant. “Humankind has had some amazing journeys,” says James Hansen, professor of history at Alabama’s Auburn University and author of the book First Man: The Life of Neil A Armstrong, from which Damien Chazelle’s film First Man is adapted. “There have been major technological events. Splitting the atom. But going to the moon, it’s kind of like the Chinese stepping off the Formosa straits for the first time. The major movement of peoples. The Vikings making it all the way to Greenland. These amazing stories of humanity moving and seeking and exploring. If we just stay put in one place, we don’t learn. To have our species leaving our own planet and stepping on to another heavenly body for the first time, it’s a major event in the history of humankind. Neil certainly recognised that, and I think he built that into the words that he said when he walked off the lunar module on to the surface.”The world witnessed Armstrong’s great leap: nearly 600 million rapt people, a fifth of the planet’s population back then, were glued to their radios and televisions, all experiencing the event. John F Kennedy had, in 1961, promised that it would happen by the end of the decade: “The eyes of the world now look into space, to the moon and to the planets beyond,” he said. Nasa then raced to make that wild promise a reality, and not without loss of life along the way. But the world needed it.“It was a time of such incredibly high tension nationally and internationally, and I think everyone felt we were right on the brink of potential world war III,” said Armstrong in 2001. “I don’t think anybody, even the people in the backwoods of Montana, were unaware of this tension. I was very aware of it.” Getting to the moon, he thought, could transcend it all. Armstrong was a fighter pilot between 1950 and 1952, flying 78 missions in the Korean war before he was 22. “He never showed any fear in any of his close calls,” said his brother Dean. He became a research pilot for Nasa, flying more than 200 different aircraft before becoming an astronaut. “The unknowns were rampant,” he later said of the moon landing, but he batted off phantom computer alarms, enormous boulders and just 20 seconds of fuel remaining as he touched down. “The Eagle has landed,” he radioed to Houston. “You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue, we’re breathing again,” the controller responded.First Man is a soulful, sensitive portrayal of Armstrong’s personal journey, with Damien Chazelle focusing on Armstrong’s intimate thoughts and feelings, bringing one of history’s most iconic moments down to Earth. “This was a feat beyond imagination – it was truly a giant leap for mankind,” says Chazelle. “This film is about one of the most extraordinary accomplishments not only in American history, but in human history. My hope is that by digging under the surface and humanising the icon, we can better understand just how difficult, audacious and heroic this moment really was.”By concentrating on the man, Chazelle makes his film resonate for all of us – as the event itself did 49 years ago. “The plaque left on the leg of the lunar lander said: ‘Here, men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon. We came in peace for all mankind,’” says Hansen. “This was a human achievement that we all share. It was a moment of global commonality and consciousness, something we all participated in. It was a brief pause in all the disillusion of humankind – we all took a breath and stepped away and saw that we had something very much in common.”With men having set foot on the moon, anything seemed possible. The future had begun, and with it a world of opportunity. To experience it was to be inspired. “He changed the world. And, of course, he certainly changed me,” wrote science communicator Bill Nye after Armstrong died in 2012. “Neil Armstrong raised the expectations, the hopes and dreams of every human on Earth. Thanks to him, we all believe that humans can achieve great things, that we can learn about our place among the stars, that we can all reach up and out, that we can fly, and change the world.”First Man is released nationwide on 12 October – book tickets here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74df3a8a3d71454b88a2fd01b32ae73ae7089e85/240_0_3594_2157/master/3594.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=707fece458768dfe3ded1eb970ad06ab 880w","title":"matteo aloes recipe for pappa al pomodoro with mozzarella and nduja","story":"The Italian staple for using up waste bread gets a spicy twist with melted Calabrian ’ndjua and buffalo mozzarellaEvery region in Italy has a different method and recipe to salvage waste bread, from ribollita to polpette to panzanella.

He talks regrets, rock bottom and why he is finally at peaceIt was a Sunday get-together that featured Manchester United royalty. Sir Matt Busby was there and so was Nobby Stiles, among others. It was the early 1990s the venue a wine bar in Sale, and the question was for Stiles, then in charge of the B team at Old Trafford. Who was the best up-and-coming youngster at the club?Stiles did not hesitate. “Ben Thornley,” he replied. What, even including Ryan Giggs? “Ben is the closest I’ve seen to George Best in all my time at the club,” Stiles said. Busby did not bat an eyelid.Thornley smiles. “Crazy, absolutely crazy,” he says. “There are very few footballers that have ever lived that would measure up to George Best and so to be compared to him, at whatever level, by somebody who has been a World Cup winner – well, you can’t ask for more than that.”Thornley was the Salford boy who lived the dream. Taken on to United’s books at 14, the winger made his first-team debut as a substitute at West Ham when he was 18 and he was in line to feature in the 1994 FA Cup semi-final against Oldham. Then, in practically the blink of an eye, it was snatched away from him.Playing for the reserves against Blackburn Rovers, he was the victim of a dreadful tackle from Nicky Marker, then a 28-year-old professional. It would be quicker to say which parts of Thornley’s knee were not in tatters. The medial collateral ligament was completely ruptured and so was the medial capsule. Both cruciate ligaments were ruptured while the medial meniscus was detached and the hamstring attachment partially torn.Rob Swire, the United physiotherapist at the time, says it was the worst knee injury he saw in 30 years. Sir Alex Ferguson, who was in the stands that night, was outraged and he insisted that Thornley, backed by United, pursue a civil action against Marker and Blackburn. After five years, he would secure a pay-out.The story of the wonderkid who fails to fulfil his potential for whatever reason is an old one, if invariably sad. Yet Thornley’s has come to resonate more deeply because of his time and place. Everybody knows about United’s Class of 92, the band of brothers who won the FA Youth Cup that year – the club’s first success in the tournament since 1964 – to launch stellar careers. But not everyone knows that Thornley was the best of the lot of them.“Ben would have outdone us all – that’s the sad part,” David Beckham says. “Without a doubt, he would have been one of the best for United and England.” Paul Scholes describes Thornley as “a step above all of us, he could do everything”, while Gary Neville says he was “one of the most outstanding talents I ever played with”.Thornley fought back after surgery and it is a testament to his ability and determination that he made 13 further appearances for United between 1995 and 1998. But he had to adjust to a new reality, one in which his best level was not as high, and his career as a full-time professional would end in November 2003 as a 28‑year‑old, after spells at Huddersfield, Aberdeen, Blackpool and Bury. He went on to play with Halifax, Bacup Borough, Salford City and Witton Albion.Meanwhile, he had to watch as his friends from United hit the heights. Thornley was closest to Gary Neville and Beckham but he was, and is, held in great esteem by all of the gang, including Giggs, Scholes, Nicky Butt and Phil Neville. The admiration is stamped across the pages of his soon-to-be-released autobiography.One of the things that shines through in Thornley is the absence of jealousy. “I am immensely proud of everything that they all went on to achieve and that extends beyond the lads that we know as the Class of 92 – to people like Keith Gillespie, Robbie Savage, Chris Casper and John O’Kane,” Thornley says. “Despite what happened to me, they were always going to make that level. I don’t know if I would have done but I know for a fact I would have been given the opportunity to try.”Thornley’s book is loaded with poignant moments but there is one that stands out. In the 65th minute of the reserve game against Blackburn the United coach, Jim Ryan – mindful of the looming FA Cup semi-final – asks Thornley whether he is OK to carry on. “Yeah, Jim, I’m fine,” he replies. Five minutes later, Marker jumps into his knee.What if Thornley had gone off? It is a haunting question. “People have always asked me that,” Thornley says. “It’s probably the worst decision that I’ve ever made in my life and something that completely changed my life.”Thornley is at peace, these days, with how his elite-level career was destroyed. But it has been a process, a struggle at times, and one line from his brother, Rod, who is a masseur at United, hits home strongly. “Ben wasn’t the same person after the injury,” he says. “If I’m brutally honest, since that day, he’s never been as happy as he was before.”Thornley pauses. “He’s probably got a point,” he says. “My brother notices things that only a brother would. Only really in the last four or five years have I come out of that cocoon, if you like.”Post-United, there were good times on the pitch, namely Thornley’s first seasons at Huddersfield and Aberdeen. But the frustration and, yes, the anger were difficult to suppress. Thornley’s professional focus drifted, which would have been unthinkable before the injury, and he took solace in alcohol.Thornley hit rock bottom in 2006. He separated from his wife, Claire – the mother of his 14-year-old son, Lucas – in the January and he went on a rampage. “I went from one pub to another, from one woman to another, from one stag do to another – not sleeping, not eating, just drinking and drinking,” Thornley says. “Somebody said: ‘Listen, if you are not careful you are going to kill yourself.’ All of a sudden, after eight or nine months, I just stopped. I said: ‘I can’t continue like this.’”Thornley has rediscovered a balance in his life, thanks mainly to Lesley, his girlfriend of 10 years, and his work for United’s in-house TV and radio station, MUTV, and in the Old Trafford hospitality suites. Previously, he had worked as a minicab driver, a restaurant manager and a tiler. It was not him.Talk to anybody who knows Thornley and the same descriptions recur: gobby, snappy, daft, so Salford. His former teammates rib him mercilessly about his crimes against fashion. “You look back at photos and think: ‘What am I wearing?’” Giggs says. “But then you look at Ben and think: ‘At least I didn’t look as bad as that.’”Above all, Thornley is sparkling company, the type of lad who people want to be around. I grew up on the next street to him and I was always struck by his infectiousness.Thornley passes unforgiving judgment on his career. “I will always have fallen short of what I thought I could achieve,” he says. On the other hand, he has the tales to tell from a life of rich experience, in which he has made his mark. Not many kids from the old neighbourhood are on first‑name terms with Bryan Robson, have seen the Fergie hairdryer and have been out on the pull with Beckham.“I used to say that something good would come out of my injury one day,” Thornley says. “And that something has been this book. It makes me feel so humble that the guys I grew up with have been willing to vouch for me 20-odd years later to possibly make people realise that I wasn’t some pie-in-the-sky kid who never made it.

It is an enormous, meandering journey through ancient Greece at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war as the struggle between Sparta and Athens begins to reshape the Greek world. It will shock you with its breadth and depth: the sea hides sunken ruins, the detail of temple paintings is impeccable, authentically clothed characters wander enormous cities whilst chatting in Greek, soldiers clash on roads as citizens scatter.You play a mercenary, choosing between the equally statuesque and self-assured Kassandra or Alexios. There is an element of family drama that propels the story forward in counterpart to the overarching historical drama of the setting. The script is exactly the same for both characters choosing Kassandra, I found her to be a great mix of sharp writing, subtle character animation and a standout performance by voice actor Melissanthi Mahut.The writers and designers of Assassin’s Creed enjoy artistic license with history, filling in the gaps in their own idiosyncratic style. The game truly finds its voice when it embraces the strangeness of the surrounding mythos of the series itself, entwining it with the more recognisable Greek mythology.. Historical figures such as Herodotus and Leonidas also make appearances.The scope is gargantuan. Playing on an original Xbox One, the frame-rate would occasionally drop, but this didn’t stop the game from delivering gorgeous vistas. Ancient Greece is the perfect setting for an Assassin’s Creed game: you clamber up temples and historic sites, push through bustling marketplaces, cling to sun-bleached stone cliffs above azure seas, gallop on a horse through autumnal forests. Exploration mode, the recommended way to play, has you figuring out where to go from clues picked up through conversation and observed in your surroundings, encouraging you to pay attention to the dynamic Greece that Ubisoft has created.The scope extends to a plethora of systems. Get caught murdering or stealing and a bounty will be placed on your head. Mercenaries will then track you down relentlessly, adding a sense of consequence to your transgressions. You can also whittle away at a region’s military presence so it can be conquered by either Athens or Sparta, but this never really grabbed me it’s potentially interesting that every soldier you kill has an effect, but I was never sure why my mercenary was supposed to care, and with plenty else to keep me occupied, I never cared either.Decisions play a prominent role, and optional romance has been introduced for the first time, though it’s underdeveloped. It’s fun to see Kassandra flirt with a confidence that would make Aphrodite blush, but perhaps “romance” is too strong a word for these throwaway flings. Oddly, some objects of your (very fleeting) desire can occasionally be recruited as lieutenants on your ship, where they stand around in silence, gazing at nothing until a battle breaks out. The antics on the Aegean Sea are a highlight of the game – the bow crashing against waves as your crew sing shanties and a whale leaps out of the water makes you feel as if you’re the hero of an epic poem.Odyssey’s writing is good, skilfully navigating humour and emotion, though it would benefit the game if it trusted its writing more instead of throwing combat into situations that don’t need it. Upon being sent on one quest by an amusingly insufferable Socrates, to judge whether a horse thief should be able to keep his stolen steed, I found the thief waiting in a guarded area, meaning I had to sneak past guards and kill a handful of soldiers before meeting him. The action got in the way of the point of this side quest: a dialogue between two characters. If Assassin’s Creed wants to become more of a role-playing game, it should allow the work of its clearly capable writers to take centre-stage more often.At the beginning, the game feels too slow, teasing you with a range of combat abilities but then making you painstakingly unlock each of them. (The “spartan kick” ability deserves especial acclaim: kicking enemies off cliffs, boats and battlements never diminishes in satisfaction.) This isn’t a game for people who like to speed through a story after 50 no-nonsense hours the end is still nowhere in sight.You have the option to buy “time-saver packs” that offer you permanent experience or in-game currency boosts to speed things up – but when it sometimes feels like the game is intentionally slowing your progress, this leaves a bitter taste. I started a series of quests at level 29, only to find that as it built to a crescendo, the game suddenly informed me that I should be at level 40 to continue, interrupting a compelling storyline until I’d gone off and spent hours gaining levels. This feels like self-sabotage in an otherwise excellent game.Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is satisfyingly authentic. The sunlight and baked earth of Crete made me a little sweaty, and the buzz of conversation in Athens made it feel alive. It is not a direct re-creation of ancient Greece, but an entertaining world of Ubisoft’s invention, and you get to stride through this place as a capable and instantly likable character. Not everything that Odyssey ambitiously attempts is successful, and it greedily consumes your time, but I’ve relished the many hours I’ve spent with it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82670f10d81666d206f2d5aea1e16c275ebc668e/0_450_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d06c4dd55839ea44c75288d5f6429faf","title":"introducing the new guardian weekly","story":"Today, I am delighted to reveal a new-look  Weekly, a beautiful magazine featuring our best reporting and writing from around the world.Before the  launched our first website in the mid-1990s, the only way for most readers outside of the United Kingdom and Ireland to read our journalism was in the  Weekly.

But such eruptions are essential to the vitality of modern politics. By  James MillerEveryone seems to agree that democracy is under attack. What is surprising is how many of its usual friends have come to fear democracy itself – or perhaps to fear that a country’s people, too inflamed by narrow passions, risk turning politics into a distasteful blood sport, pitting The People vs Democracy, in the startling words of one recent book title.Observers have understandable qualms about political programmes that are alarmingly illiberal, yet obviously democratic, in that most citizens support them. In Poland and Hungary, democratically elected ruling parties attack Muslim migrants for undermining Christian identity. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte rules with an iron fist, pledging to put drug pushers in funeral parlours, not prisons.Modern democracies all rest on a claim of popular sovereignty – the proposition that all legitimate governments grow out of the power of a people, and in some way are subject to its will. Yet when a large majority of a country’s people vehemently supports policies a critic finds abhorrent, many liberals, even avowed democrats, recoil in horror.Thus arises the possibility of a painful paradox: that “democracies end when they are too democratic”. So concluded a 2016 piece by the US political observer Andrew Sullivan, resurrecting an argument made two generations earlier by Samuel Huntington (in a 1975 report called The Crisis of Democracy, issued in the wake of the international student revolts of the 1960s).Even the leftwing scholar Chantal Mouffe, who has long championed raw populist conflict as the essence of “radical democracy”, seems distraught at current events. “Democracy that is in good working order – with conflict, but where people accept the existence of their adversaries – is not easy to re-establish,” she recently told an interviewer, gesturing implicitly toward tolerance, one of the most jeopardised liberal norms in the current context: “I’m not that optimistic.”Current affairs may seem especially bleak, but fears about democracy are nothing new. At the zenith of direct democracy in ancient Athens, in the fifth century BC, one critic called it a “patent absurdity” – and so it seemed to most political experts from Aristotle to Edmund Burke, who considered democracy “the most shameless thing in the world”. As the American founding father John Adams warned, “there never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide”.For almost 2,000 years, most western political theorists agreed with Aristotle, Burke and Adams: nobody could imagine seriously advocating democracy as an ideal form of government. It was only at the end of the 18th century that democracy reappeared as a modern political ideal, during the French Revolution.Ever since, popular insurrections and revolts in the name of democracy have become a recurrent feature of global politics. It needs to be stressed: these revolts are not an unfortunate blemish on the peaceful forward march toward a more just society they form the heart and soul of modern democracy as a living reality.It is a familiar story: out of the blue, it seems, a crowd pours into a city square or gathers at a barnstorming rally held by a spellbinding orator, to protest against hated institutions, to express rage at the betrayals of the ruling class, to seize control of public spaces. To label these frequently disquieting moments of collective freedom “populist”, in a pejorative sense, is to misunderstand a constitutive feature of the modern democratic project.Yet these episodes of collective self-assertion are invariably fleeting, and often provoke a political backlash in turn. The political disorder they create stands in tension with the need for a more stable, peaceful form of collective participation. That is one reason why many modern democrats have tried to create representative institutions that can – through liberal protections for the freedom of religion, and of the press, and the civil rights of minorities – both express, and tame, the will of a sovereign people.Thus the great French philosopher Condorcet in 1793 proposed creating a new, indirect form of self-rule, linking local assemblies to a national government. “By ingrafting representation upon democracy,” as Condorcet’s friend Tom Paine put it, the people could exercise their power both directly, in local assemblies, and indirectly, by provisionally entrusting some of their powers to elected representatives.Under the pressure of events, another ardent French democrat, Robespierre, went further and defended the need, amid a civil war, for a temporary dictatorship – precisely to preserve the possibility of building a more enduring form of representative democracy, once its enemies had been defeated and law and order could be restored.But there was a problem with these efforts to establish a modern democracy at scale. Especially in a large nation such as France or the US, representative institutions – and, even worse, dictatorial regimes claiming a popular mandate – inevitably risk frustrating anyone hoping to play a more direct role in political decision-making.This means that the democratic project, both ancient and modern, is inherently unstable. The modern promise of popular sovereignty, repeatedly frustrated, produces recurrent efforts at asserting the collective power of a people. If observers like the apparent result of such an effort, they may hail it as a renaissance of the democratic spirit if they do not, they are liable to dismiss these episodes of collective self-assertion as mob rule, or populism run amok.No matter. Even though the post-second world war consensus over the meaning and value of liberal democratic institutions seems more fragile than ever – polls show that trust in elected representatives has rarely been lower – democracy as furious dissent flourishes, in vivid and vehement outbursts of anger at remote elites and shadowy enemies.It is important to sharply distinguish democracy from liberalism – two value-laden words that, in recent years, have become almost hopelessly conflated and confused, especially in the work of social scientists and western political pundits who fret that western liberal democracy, once the “promised land”, has become “the enemy” in places like Hungary.Unlike democracy, “liberalism” is a relatively late addition to our political lexicon. In Europe, the word first came into wide usage in the 19th century by various political theorists and statesmen in France, Germany and Italy, united in their horror at the bloodshed of the French Revolution, but otherwise varied in their positive views.Modern democracy also has no necessary connection to liberalism. The Protestant champions of popular sovereignty in the 16th century summoned it for the express purpose of dethroning rulers with whose religious views they disagreed: “It was not religious liberty they sought, but the elimination of wrong religions,” as the historian Edmund Morgan wrote in 1988.What is clear today is that while democracy may be widely admired, it is, in its liberal form, an embattled ideology. As the social scientist William Galston has sharply observed: “Few leaders and movements in the west dare to challenge the idea of democracy itself. Not so for liberalism, which has come under mounting attack.” One result has been the rise of popular movements in which a majority of ordinary citizens has embraced a narrow conception of solidarity and rallied around a leader who claims to embody the will of such a closed community.Another result has been a resurgence of traditional anxieties, notably in the UK and the US, about democracy and its obvious dangers. After all, why should we entrust the fate of the Earth to large numbers of ordinary citizens foolish enough to support self-destructive policies and manifestly unfit leaders?Most ancient authorities reviled democracy in Athens. Plato, perhaps the most widely admired writer in antiquity, and someone who lived under democratic rule in the fourth century, criticised the false beliefs that prevailed in a city governed by public opinion rather than true knowledge, and he deplored the “insolence, anarchy, wastefulness, and shamelessness” that those false beliefs facilitated. The historian Thucydides, another citizen of democratic Athens, who chronicled the Peloponnesian War with Sparta that ended with the defeat of Athens in 404, essentially blamed the power of the ordinary people of Athens, and their susceptibility to manipulation by mendacious orators, for this catastrophic outcome.Thanks to such critiques – as well as subsequent political developments, from the Macedonian empire of Alexander the Great to modern European monarchies claiming a ine right to rule – for a long time nobody much cared about the Athenian political system, or about democracy as a form of government.The Athenian democracy certainly doesn’t measure up by modern liberal standards: at its zenith in the fifth and fourth centuries BC, it did not choose most of its government by holding elections nor did it protect the human rights of its citizens, as it lacked any notion of such rights nor were the fundamental powers of the Athenian polis enshrined in a comprehensive written document.What Athens did have is a community in which every citizen was expected to participate in the political life of the city – and far more actively than in any modern democracy. At the height of democracy in Athens, an assembly of citizens, open to all, met at least 40 times a year. All political offices were held by ordinary citizens, randomly selected, and all legal judgments in the city’s courts were reached by large juries of ordinary citizens, similarly selected. And all this happened in a comparatively large commercial city that dominated the eastern Mediterranean world for nearly two centuries.These institutions were the result of a popular uprising in 508BC, against Spartan troops who had seized the Acropolis. Instead of acquiescing in a foreign occupation, the ordinary citizens of Athens spontaneously converged on the Acropolis and surrounded the Spartan army. It took only three days to drive the Spartans from the city – which suggests the popular uprising had numbers and force on its side.The result was a sweeping transformation of Athenian institutions and the subsequent appearance, for the first time in history, of “democracy”, as a word to describe a regime where power (kratos) was in the hands of ordinary people (demos). Henceforth all legislation in Athens had to be validated in the assembly, which was now open to all citizens, no matter how poor. Even more important was the use of a lottery to staff most city offices and juries, which nullified the corrupting advantages conferred in elections by wealth and family prominence.By empowering an impoverished multitude in this manner, critics charged, the assembly and democratic orators had in fact created a new kind of tyranny – a collective tyranny of the majority, a de facto welfare state that doled out money and patronage to the ordinary citizens who manned the imperial fleet and staffed the city’s courts and offices.For Plato, the key problem was epistemological: most people – “the many” – had no knowledge of truth and no clear pattern of justice in their minds. Democracy corrupted even intelligent citizens by leading them to dumb down their policies in order to pander to ignorant crowds. When they gathered “in assemblies, courts, theatres, army camps, or any other common meeting of a multitude,” the Athenian demos, Plato reports, would “blame some of the things said or done, and praise others, both in excess, shouting and clapping and besides, the rocks and the very place surrounding them echo and redouble the uproar of praise and blame.”After the eclipse of direct self-rule in the ancient world, the idea of democracy survived, barely. In the west, it was mainly used as a term of art, deployed by legal scholars, generally in two contradictory usages. On the one hand, democracy became a virtual synonym for violent anarchy: the Roman historian Polybius said “the license and lawlessness” of democracy inevitably “produces mob rule”, to complete a cycle through which all governments had to pass, going from best (monarchy) to worst (democracy, and then mob rule).On the other hand, Polybius also argued that democracy had a potentially constructive role to play. He suggested that the most durable political regime would be a republic that combined the three pure forms of government (monarchy, aristocracy and democracy) into interlinked branches that would check and balance each other, enabling a well-ordered republic to navigate the winds of time “like a well-trimmed boat”.In the centuries that followed, a tradition of republican thought emerged, based on the example of ancient Rome. During the Renaissance, some theorists working within the republican tradition cautiously suggested that ordinary people might have an especially useful role to play, especially as watchdogs and soldiers. Because they were jealous of their freedom, they would be vigilant spectators of executive and administrative conduct, on guard against malfeasance. The very passions of the people, which could generate a certain esprit de corps, could also be harnessed for the enhancement of a republic’s military might. Machiavelli, dreaming of a resurgence of Italian glory in the Renaissance, was eager to exploit popular ardour: “The best armies are those of armed peoples,” rather than paid mercenaries.At the same time, republican writers tended to agree that the chief danger to a mixed constitution came from the democratic element, because of its tendency to degenerate into violence and anarchy. Machiavelli warned that the people, left to their own devices, were “promoters of license”. Algernon Sidney, an English republican beheaded for expressing treasonous views in 1683, denied being a proponent of pure democracy. So did the Enlightenment philosopher Montesquieu, who pointedly worried about the “spirit of extreme equality” he assumed was typical of democracies. Even in the US, in the wake of a war against colonial rule by a distant monarch and amid expansive new assertions of the power of the people, political theorists handled the idea of democracy gingerly, if they acknowledged it at all.In this context, the political writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau came as a shock. The key was the audacious way he redefined sovereignty in terms of democracy. Before Rousseau, “sovereignty” had implied brute force, empire and the ability to command. After him, it defined not the dominion of monarchs, but the legitimate power of a people. In the wake of the French Revolution, he came to be seen as a prophet, for writings such as this, from Emile, first published in 1763: “The great become small, the rich become poor, the monarch becomes subject are the blows of fate so rare that you can count on being exempted from them? We are approaching the state of crisis and the century of revolutions.”By the summer of 1792, militants inspired by Rousseau were arguing that political power, properly understood, belonged neither to a king, nor to a distant body of elected representatives, but rather to the people assembled in their local neighbourhoods, where they could discuss their shared fate face to face. Events came to a head on 10 August 1792, when a majority of these local assemblies resolved that only an armed revolt would assure that the French people were truly sovereign. At midnight, they seized the town hall in the morning they assaulted the king’s quarters at the Tuileries Palace, although by then he and his family had fled for their lives.The most radically democratic phase of the French Revolution thus began with a carnival of atrocities. But the violence cracked open a new world of political possibilities. For the first time since ancient Athens, direct democracy had become a concrete, collective goal – at least in the minds of the Parisian commoners streaming through the streets with their muskets and pikes.This uprising led to the dissolution of the French National Assembly, the convening of a constitutional convention and the public execution of the king after a show trial. The convention enabled Condorcet to draft the world’s first democratic constitution. But it was never implemented – a Jacobin coup forced Condorcet into hiding, and led to a reign of terror, which the Jacobin leader, Robespierre, argued was necessary to defend the nascent democracy from its many foes, both foreign and French.In the autumn of 1793, the new republic’s conscripts, on orders from Paris, embarked on a murderous rampage in the Vendée that killed some 250,000 people, most of them innocent men, women and children. The French Revolution had resurrected the idea of democracy – and produced a hecatomb on a grand scale.“Of this I am certain,” Burke declared, “that in a democracy, the majority of the citizens is capable of exercising the most cruel oppressions upon the minority.” In the aftermath of the French Revolution, his fears were widely shared by conservatives and self-described “liberals”.Fearful of armed crowds and the possibility of mob rule, the American constitution had been explicitly designed to empower not ordinary citizens, but a “natural aristocracy”. As Benjamin Rush, a signatory of the Declaration of Independence, explained: “All power is derived from the people” – but this power is not wielded by the people: “They possess it only on the days of their elections. After this, it is property of their rulers, nor can they exercise or resume it, unless it is abused.”To this day, the US remains a deeply flawed democracy. It still has an electoral college designed to thwart majorities. It still has a senate that guarantees inequality of political representation. It still is the scene of pitched struggles over the right to vote.Yet, this primordial American prejudice against democracy was almost instantly transformed by an equally passionate upwelling of American enthusiasm for democracy, in the wake of the French Revolution. Among the enthusiasts was Thomas Jefferson, who, in 1800, brought his Democratic-Republican party to power, and in this way also brought democracy – at least as a word – into the American lexicon.A generation later, Andrew Jackson, the first great American democratic leader – or, demagogue, to use the ancient Greek term of art for such a leader – became the US’s first plebiscitary president, imbued with imperial prerogatives in the eyes of his most ardent supporters. He was, after all, the only representative nominally elected by all the nation’s people (unless, of course, they were women, slaves or Native Americans – democracy in America in Jackson’s day was only the white man’s business).Jackson tried, and failed, to eliminate the electoral college. Such enduring limits to democracy in the US were, paradoxically, one reason why it was the first country to give birth to populism, both as a word and as a phenomenon. From 1892 till 1896, a People’s Party played a major political role in some parts of the US.At roughly the same time, Woodrow Wilson, arguably the country’s most ardent champion of democracy, criticised the populist movement and offered, instead, a new vision of the democratic system. A pioneering political scientist who would become the 28th president, Wilson pondered deeply the meaning of democracy, not just in the US, but in world history, where it marked in his view the highest stage of human evolution. In his private papers, after rejecting European conceptions of democracy as primitive, and corrupted by class conflict, he defined modern democracy “most briefly” as “government by popular opinion”.As Wilson concedes almost in passing, democracy in practice will always involve “the many led by the few: the minds of the few disciplined by persuading, and masses of men schooled and directed by being persuaded”. In other words, Wilson’s vision of self-rule is closer to Adams’s “natural aristocracy” than the popular sovereignty the French revolutionaries and American populists fought for.We find here a core ambiguity at the heart of modern liberal democracy, as Wilson understood it. All power in theory derives from the people – but in practice, the truest vessel of a people’s hopes will be its highest elected official when he enjoys the support of “public opinion”.There were, nonetheless, serious problems with Wilson’s recourse to public opinion. Views could rapidly change, and even an orator as persuasive as Wilson could not be sure if he had persuaded his fellows once and for all. Even worse – as Walter Lippmann pointed out in his landmark 1922 study, Public Opinion – in a complex political environment, where only disconnected bits of information are available to the average citizen, it was almost impossible in practice for the public’s opinion on any matter of moment to be either cogent or coherent.Lippman used for his epigraph Plato’s famous image of the inhabitants of a cave bewitched by shadows and unaware of the real world outside. The majority of modern men, Lippmann argues, are prisoners of shadowy and unexamined assumptions, immersed in private lives involving the pursuit of personal interests, with limited time and even less attention to give to public affairs.Lippmann’s conclusion is most bluntly stated in The Phantom Public: “The inidual man does not have opinions on all public affairs. He does not know how to direct public affairs. He does not know what is happening, why it is happening, what ought to happen. I cannot imagine how he could know, and there is not the least reason for thinking, as mystical democrats have thought, that the compounding of inidual ignorances in masses of people can produce a continuous directing force in public affairs.”In 1942, Joseph Schumpeter, an economist who had been born in Moravia and raised in Vienna before moving to the US in 1932 to teach at Harvard University, accurately summed up the strange results of merging a liberal democratic faith in public opinion with marketing methods refined by behavioural scientists. “What we are confronted with in the analysis of political processes,” he wrote, “is largely not a genuine but a manufactured will.”In his day, the primary tools for the manipulation of opinion were advertising and propaganda tailored to the results of public opinion polling. In our day, the integrity of public opinion is further threatened by the secrecy of many aspects of executive decision-making, and the increasingly sophisticated control of information by behavioural scientists and attention merchants, who are able to use new technologies to aim messages with unprecedented precision at responsive audiences.Schumpeter argued that the primary role of the people in a liberal democracy was in any case strictly limited: it was “to produce a government, or else an intermediate body which in turn will produce a national executive or government … the democratic method is that institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions in which iniduals acquire the power to decide by means of a competitive struggle for the people’s vote.”In other words, modern democracy was not the rule of a sovereign people – instead, “democracy is the rule of the politician”, someone skilled at commanding public opinion and winning elections, whose power is chiefly balanced by his need for reelection, and the requirement that he leave office peacefully, should he lose the vote.Schumpeter was writing during the second world war, which had led to the total mobilisation of the civilian population in all combatant states. Worldwide, this unprecedented mobilisation led to the unprecedented slaughter of 60 million souls, the majority of them civilians, and six million of them Jews. In the US, it entailed a dramatic increase in the powers of the administrative state and of the state’s armed forces it also triggered a rise in the perceived need to keep key political deliberations and decisions concealed from the public.Faced with such facts, no wonder Schumpeter was pessimistic about future political prospects, fearing that a “socialist democracy may eventually turn out to be more of a sham than capitalist democracy ever was”.And yet, as the second world war unfolded, just as had happened during the first world war, there was a paradoxical resurgence of democratic idealism, inspired by renewed Allied claims that their victory would help forge a world “made safe for democracy”, just as Wilson had promised two generations earlier.After the horrors of two world wars, many hoped humanity would never again resort to violence on this industrial scale. After some hesitation, and with compromising caveats similar to those that undermined the League of Nations covenant – above all, a continuing effort to protect the imperial and racial prerogatives of the great powers – the victors agreed to create a new international organisation, the United Nations, and to ratify a new set of global principles, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948.It is easy to minimise the importance of a political document issued with no means of enforcing the norms it proclaimed. Yet the language of the declaration helped to inspire later human rights movements, and article 21 explicitly affirms that “everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives”.Here is a key irony of the modern world: to this day, democracy, in most existing regimes, whether liberal or socialist or nationalist, is more or less a sham, even according to the criteria laid out in the UDHR, and just as Schumpeter said.Still, this “sham” also represents an epochal transformation: in the early 21st century, very few regimes, unlike most in the early 18th century, can rule over a subject population with impunity. On the contrary: the rulers of every contemporary regime that professes democratic values, however feebly realised, must periodically face the mundane threat posed by ordinary citizens, however uninformed, periodically queuing at a polling station, to exercise their right to vote, and so to transfer power, if they choose, to an entirely new set of political leaders.This is, as the Cambridge historian John Dunn puts it in the dyspeptic but accurate conclusion to his 2005 history of democracy, “a world in which faith, deference and even loyalty have largely passed away, and the keenest of personal admiration seldom lasts for long” – a wan description of what the modern democratic spirit has wrought.Yet this is also a world where the ideal of democracy is more universally honoured than ever before, and sometimes taken quite seriously, for better or worse.For example, in the decades since the ratification of the UDHR in 1948, most US presidents and diplomats have followed in Wilson’s footsteps by promoting liberal democratic expectations around the world – sometimes at gunpoint – just as communist regimes were trying at the same time to export their rival version of “democratic centralism”.So it is perhaps not surprising that our world has also witnessed, in virtually every country, poor or developed, socialist or communist, autocratic or liberal, a fitful, sometimes futile series of popular uprisings and protests, when crowds of ordinary people unite to demand a fairer share of the common wealth – and to claim for themselves a larger share in more truly democratic institutions. These revolts against remote elites are essential to the vitality, and viability, of modern democracy – even as (and precisely because) they challenge the status quo, destructive though that challenge may be.There are good reasons to be wary of what a people trying to exercise its sovereign rights may produce. Democratic revolts can create perverse results – and so can democratic elections. Despite the obvious risks, both Rousseau and Jefferson invoked a relevant maxim in defence of their own faith in ordinary citizens: Malo periculosam, libertatem quam quietam servitutem – “I prefer a dangerous freedom to peaceful slavery.” It’s an apt motto for these dark times.Adapted from Can Democracy Work?

What can we expect?After a series of deadline extensions and fudged decisions, Britain and the EU are finally approaching what is very much the endgame for Brexit. In the coming weeks, the basic form of departure that will take place will most likely be decided upon. What can we expect?Officially, one date looms large: next Wednesday, when a summit of EU leaders in Brussels will attempt to thrash out Brexit terms that are acceptable both to Theresa May and the EU27. While there have been positive noises recently, it is likely that too much remains to be done for it all to be agreed by then.The focus would then switch to an emergency summit, pencilled in for 13 November, giving more time for movement on both sides. There is speculation that yet another gathering might then be timetabled if it is needed.The intervening weeks will be filled with official and semi-official talks, soundings-out, ideas being floated and endless internal negotiations. Any agreement will then have to be approved swiftly by both houses of parliament – which is by no means a given – and endorsed by all EU member states before the departure date on 29 March.The two primary points of contention are connected: the Irish border and the framework for future trade and customs arrangements. Most knotty is Ireland, where May cannot have either a hard border nor a situation where Northern Ireland is aligned more closely with the EU than the rest of the UK, creating a customs border in the Irish Sea.Adding to the muddle is the official UK insistence that the EU’s so-called backstop arrangement for the border, which would create alignment in the absence of a deal, be time-limited – something Brussels says cannot be done.They certainly hope they can. The European Research Group (ERG) of hardline pro-Brexit Conservative MPs is officially supportive of May as prime minister but says she must drop her proposals in favour of a free-trade-based deal that would keep the UK less aligned to EU regulations, the so-called “Canada plus” or “super Canada” option.They and their allies are maintaining a stream of negative comments and stories about May’s Chequers plan. The former Brexit secretary David Davis wrote to all Conservative MPs on Tuesday claiming that the Chequers plan would cost the party future votes.It remains to be seen whether this can be translated into enough Commons votes to sink Chequers: earlier ERG predictions that 80 opposing votes could be mustered have now been downgraded to about 40.Other predictions put the number at closer to between 10 and 20. Either way, May will face a considerable amount of noise and pressure.A cabinet that coped with the Chequers-inspired departures of Boris Johnson and David Davis does seem more united. But even here, threats lurk for May.Some ministers are understood to be at best tolerant of May’s plan, and would chafe at more concessions. The international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, pointedly declined to endorse Chequers this week.It is still a hugely fluid situation, with any number of potential pitfalls, detours and cul-de-sacs.May faces intense pressure from her informal coalition allies in the DUP, who are ratcheting up the pressure on her over the Northern Ireland issue. It has threatened to vote against this month’s budget if May crosses its red lines over UK customs integrity at the next EU summit.It also remains to be seen whether the EU will be as amenable as hoped at next week’s summit. All the noises before the informal gathering in Salzburg last month had been harmonious, but it ended in humiliation for May.Making confident political predictions is reckless at the best of times, but that goes double for Brexit.The consensus among pundits seems to be that an agreement on some version of the Chequers deal, with compromises on both sides, is the most likely outcome. Then May could just about get the deal through the Commons, especially if some Labour MPs defy the whip to back the plan.As the weeks pass, it seems increasingly likely that if there is a deal, it will be based around May’s blueprint. For all the ERG’s calls to “chuck Chequers”, time is running out to start from scratch with a Canada-type idea.However, it would be foolish to rule out a range of other options, from a collapse in talks bringing a no-deal departure, to UK-based political turmoil or machinations seeing May ejected or even – though it seems unlikely – a general election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b0880dec79265b35b6e46494f30f9fb373ca9db/1109_862_1439_864/master/1439.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b6d7507dbee108beb08fa6900d4020c","title":"khashoggi case is test for uks relationship with saudi arabia","story":"UK argues proximity secures influence but it faces acute dilemma over suspected killingThe multiplying allegations about high-level Saudi military involvement in the abduction or murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi is placing an unprecedented strain on the close security and trade relationship between the UK and Saudi Arabia, which has been a pillar of British foreign policy.The British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has in the past been willing to defend the relationship, saying it has prevented bombs from going off on the streets of London. It has also kept the Treasury coffers fuller.The red-carpet welcome for Mohammed bin Salman on his three-day visit to London in March was based on that longstanding relationship but also fortified by the hope that the crown prince was a reforming figure sidelining a conservative religious police. The visit led to 13 memoranda of understanding and the promise of £65bn of investment in the UK over the next decade.Privately, British diplomats have never harboured any illusions that Bin Salman’s social reforms, such as allowing women to drive, presage greater political liberty. But in aiming to ersify the Saudi economy through his Vision 2030 plan, the crown prince was at least giving post-Brexit Britain the chance to extend the relationship beyond military hardware into construction, transport and education.The Khashoggi episode threatens to make that idea less attractive and, incidentally, render the millions spent by Saudis on western PR agents largely wasted.Although it is hardly a secret that Saudi Arabia jails journalists, such a brazen state-endorsed act in a foreign country would cross a line. In the US and the UK, politicians and diplomats normally classed as friends of the Gulf kingdoms – such as Bob Corker, the Republican chair of the Senate foreign affairs committee – appear shocked.For the UK, in the middle of a démarche over extra-jurisdictional attempted killings by Russia in Salisbury, to turn a blind eye to reports alleging such a brutal act would be perceived as high hypocrisy.The dilemma is even more acute as Britain has chosen to support the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, since the failed military coup in Turkey in 2016. Turkey may not be a champion of press freedom but it will expect other foreign states to condemn any violation of its sovereignty.The Foreign Office has had its differences with the Saudis over the Iran nuclear deal but knows how little Saudi Arabia welcomes direct criticism. A single tweet in August by Global Affairs Canada, calling for the release of a female rights protester, led to the recall of the Saudi ambassador, 8,300 Saudi graduates being withdrawn from the country, a freeze on investment and the cancellation of all flights from Saudi to Canada.Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, accused Canada of treating the kingdom like a banana republic. “You can talk to us about human rights anytime you want, we’d be happy to have that conversation like we do with all our allies. But lecturing us? No way. Not going to happen,” he said. Spain and Germany have also been warned.The big question is whether the episode will prompt a wider rethink about the value of the Saudi relationship to the UK. The UK argues proximity secures influence, a point it repeatedly makes in defending its support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen. But it is reluctant to discuss the alliance more broadly. A British official due to defend the relationship at a Chatham House seminar last month withdrew at the last minute.Two recent external studies have urged the UK to rethink the relationship’s value. The Policy Institute at Kings College accepts that the Gulf remains the lifeblood of the UK arms export industry but argues that the overall value of the Saudi Arabia relationship is vastly overstated.A second study, Anglo-Arabia, published last month by Dr David Wearing, argues that the relationship is based largely on Britain’s role as a world leader in financial services, with Gulf petrodollars and sovereign wealth funds financing the UK current account deficit. It says such a deal is inherently unstable.Britain may yet be able to avert a rethink if the evidence of Saudi government involvement just falls short of overwhelming. A FBI investigation proposed by the US might sow enough doubt.Yet Theresa May’s self-declared task for “Global Britain” has been set high: “To defend the rules-based international order against irresponsible states that seek to erode it.” Global Britain is facing a first and exacting test."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1accb532328b8c9d791bf2c380e5a30b8bd747dd/120_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70a633b8cdcbd288150099bbad9c33c4","title":"black holes and soft hair why stephen hawkings final work is important","story":"Malcolm Perry, who worked with Hawking on his final paper, explains how it improves our understanding of one of universe’s enduring mysteriesThe information paradox is perhaps the most puzzling problem in fundamental theoretical physics today. It was discovered by Stephen Hawking 43 years ago, and until recently has puzzled many.Starting in 2015, Stephen, Andrew Strominger and I started to wonder if we could understand a way out of this difficulty by questioning the basic assumptions that underlie the difficulties. We published our first paper on the subject in 2016 and have been working hard on this problem ever since.The most recent work, and perhaps the last paper that Stephen was involved in, has just come out. While we have not solved the information paradox, we hope that we have paved the way, and we are continuing our intensive work in this area.Physics is really about being able to predict the future given how things are now. For example, if you throw a ball, once you know its initial position and velocity, then you can figure out where it will be in the future. That kind of reasoning is fine for what we call classical physics but for small things, like atoms and electrons, the rules need some modifications, as described by quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, instead of describing precise outcomes, one finds that one can only calculate the probabilities for various things to happen. In the case of a ball being thrown, one would not know its precise trajectory, but only the probability that it would be in some particular place given its initial conditions.What Hawking discovered was that in black hole physics, there seemed to be even greater uncertainty than in quantum mechanics. However, this kind of uncertainty seemed to be completely unacceptable in that it resulted in many of the laws of physics appearing to break down. It would deprive us of the ability to predict anything about the future of a black hole.That might not have mattered – except that black holes are real physical objects. There are huge black holes at the centres of many galaxies. We know this because observations of the centre of our galaxy show that there is a compact object with a mass of a few million times that of our sun there such a huge concentration of mass could only be a black hole. Quasars, extremely luminous objects at the centres of very distant galaxies, are powered by matter falling onto black holes. The observatory Ligo has recently discovered ripples in spacetime, gravitational waves, produced by the collision of black holes.The root of the problem is that it was once thought that black holes were completely described by their mass and their spin. If you threw something into a black hole, once it was inside you would be unable to tell what it was that was thrown in.These ideas were encapsulated in the phrase “a black hole has no hair”. We can often tell people apart by looking their hair, but black holes seemed to be completely bald. Back in 1974, Stephen discovered that black holes, rather than being perfect absorbers, behave more like what we call “black bodies”. A black body is characterised by a temperature, and all bodies with a temperature produce thermal radiation.If you go to a doctor, it is quite likely your temperature will be measured by having a device pointed at you. This is an infrared sensor and it measures your temperature by detecting the thermal radiation you produce. A piece of metal heated up in a fire will glow because it produces thermal radiation.Black holes are no different. They have a temperature and produce thermal radiation. The formula for this temperature, universally known as the Hawking temperature, is inscribed on the memorial to Stephen’s life in Westminster Abbey. Any object that has a temperature also has an entropy. The entropy is a measure of how many different ways an object could be made from its microscopic ingredients and still look the same. So, for a particular piece of red hot metal, it would be the number of ways the atoms that make it up could be arranged so as to look like the lump of metal you were observing. Stephen’s formula for the temperature of a black hole allowed him to find the entropy of a black hole.The problem then was: how did this entropy arise? Since all black holes appear to be the same, the origin of the entropy was at the centre of the information paradox.What we have done recently is to discover a gap in the mathematics that led to the idea that black holes are totally bald. In 2016, Stephen, Andy and I found that black holes have an infinite collection of what we call “soft hair”. This discovery allows us to question the idea that black holes lead to a breakdown in the laws of physics.Stephen kept working with us up to the end of his life, and we have now published a paper that describes our current thoughts on the matter. In this paper, we describe a way of calculating the entropy of black holes. The entropy is basically a quantitative measure of what one knows about a black hole apart from its mass or spin.While this is not a resolution of the information paradox, we believe it provides some considerable insight into it. Further work is needed but we feel greatly encouraged to continue our research in this area. The information paradox is intimately tied up with our quest to find a theory of gravity that is compatible with quantum mechanics.Einstein’s general theory of relativity is extremely successful at describing spacetime and gravitation on large scales, but to see how the world works on small scales requires quantum theory. There are spectacularly successful theories of the non-gravitational forces of nature as explained by the “standard model” of particle physics. Such theories have been exhaustively tested and the recent discovery of the Higgs particle at Cern by the Large Hadron Collider is a marvellous confirmation of these ideas.Yet the incorporation of gravitation into this picture is still something that eludes us. As well as his work on black holes, Stephen was pursuing ideas that he hoped would lead to a unification of gravitation with the other forces of nature in a way that would unite Einstein’s ideas with those of quantum theory. Our work on black holes does indeed shed light on this other puzzle. Sadly, Stephen is no longer with us to share our excitement about the possibility of resolving these issues, which have now been around for half a century.• Malcolm Perry is professor of theoretical physics at the University of Cambridge, and a co-author of the new black hole research."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df62edb84e7069a0109aba6528e055425847b180/0_375_3912_2347/master/3912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b283ba843cb25548d4f91d5f646e7582","title":"stephen hawkings final scientific paper released","story":"Black Hole Entropy and Soft Hair was completed in the days before the physicist’s death in March• Black holes and soft hair: why Stephen Hawking’s final work is importantStephen Hawking’s final scientific paper has been released by physicists who worked with the late cosmologist on his career-long effort to understand what happens to information when objects fall into black holes.The work, which tackles what theoretical physicists call “the information paradox”, was completed in the days before Hawking’s death in March. It has now been written up by his colleagues at Cambridge and Harvard universities and posted online.Malcolm Perry, a professor of theoretical physics at Cambridge and a co-author on the paper, Black Hole Entropy and Soft Hair, said the information paradox was “at the centre of Hawking’s life” for more than 40 years.The origins of the puzzle can be traced back to Albert Einstein. In 1915, Einstein published his theory of general relativity, a tour-de-force that described how gravity arises from the spacetime-bending effects of matter, and so why the planets circle the sun. But Einstein’s theory made important predictions about black holes too, notably that a black hole can be completely defined by only three features: its mass, charge, and spin.Nearly 60 years later, Hawking added to the picture. He argued that black holes also have a temperature. And because hot objects lose heat into space, the ultimate fate of a black hole is to evaporate out of existence. But this throws up a problem. The rules of the quantum world demand that information is never lost. So what happens to all the information contained in an object – the nature of a moon’s atoms, for instance – when it tumbles into a black hole?“The difficulty is that if you throw something into a black hole it looks like it disappears,” said Perry. “How could the information in that object ever be recovered if the black hole then disappears itself?”In the latest paper, Hawking and his colleagues show how some information at least may be preserved. Toss an object into a black hole and the black hole’s temperature ought to change. So too will a property called entropy, a measure of an object’s internal disorder, which rises the hotter it gets.The physicists, including Sasha Haco at Cambridge and Andrew Strominger at Harvard, show that a black hole’s entropy may be recorded by photons that surround the black hole’s event horizon, the point at which light cannot escape the intense gravitational pull. They call this sheen of photons “soft hair”.“What this paper does is show that ‘soft hair’ can account for the entropy,” said Perry. “It’s telling you that soft hair really is doing the right stuff.”It is not the end of the information paradox though. “We don’t know that Hawking entropy accounts for everything you could possibly throw at a black hole, so this is really a step along the way,” said Perry. “We think it’s a pretty good step, but there is a lot more work to be done.”Days before Hawking died, Perry was at Harvard working on the paper with Strominger. He was not aware how ill Hawking was and called to give the physicist an update. It may have been the last scientific exchange Hawking had. “It was very difficult for Stephen to communicate and I was put on a loudspeaker to explain where we had got to. When I explained it, he simply produced an enormous smile. I told him we’d got somewhere. He knew the final result.”Among the unknowns that Perry and his colleagues must now explore are how information associated with entropy is physically stored in soft hair and how that information comes out of a black hole when it evaporates.“It’s a step on the way, but it is definitely not the entire answer. We have slightly fewer puzzles than we had before, but there are definitely some perplexing issues left.”Marika Taylor, professor of theoretical physics at Southampton University and a former student of Hawking’s, said: “Understanding the microscopic origin of this entropy – what are the underlying quantum states that the entropy counts? – has been one of the great challenges of the last 40 years.“This paper proposes a way to understand entropy for astrophysical black holes based on symmetries of the event horizon. The authors have to make several non-trivial assumptions so the next steps will be to show that these assumptions are valid.”Juan Maldacena, a theoretical physicist at Einstein’s alma mater, the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, said: “Hawking found that black holes have a temperature. For ordinary objects we understand temperature as due to the motion of the microscopic constituents of the system. For example, the temperature of air is due to the motion of the molecules: the faster they move, the hotter it is.“For black holes, it is unclear what those constituents are, and whether they can be associated to the horizon of a black hole. In some physical systems that have special symmetries, the thermal properties can be calculated in terms of these symmetries. This paper shows that near the black hole horizon we have one of these special symmetries.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/698ce19e3b1eee82bd359b671706d61f3899422d/0_0_4928_2955/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c073e371d034bee325888e00ba29fad","title":"new law employers reveal race pay gap figures","story":"The scheme is intended to mirror elements of mandatory reporting of the gender pay gapEmployers could be obliged to release their race pay gap statistics under new plans to be unveiled by Theresa May to increase ethnic minority representation in the workplace.The prime minister will also publish a consultation on mandatory ethnicity pay reporting, marking a year since the government published the findings of its Race Disparity Audit on how people of different ethnic backgrounds are treated across society.Public services including the NHS, armed forces, schools and the police force will be told to set out plans on how they will increase the proportion of leaders from ethnic minority backgrounds.The announcement came as May was challenged by a leading Labour MP to prove her public commitment to social equality by enforcing a measure that would oblige public bodies to take account of social disadvantage when considering policy.Harriet Harman said that if May took no action on a section of the 2010 Equalities Act that was passed under Labour, then shelved by David Cameron’s government, it would show that her words on social injustice were “just crocodile tears”.The prime minister’s new commitments on ethnic equality will also see a so-called race at work charter, signed by high-profile public bodies and businesses including NHS England, Lloyds Banking Group, Saatchi \u0026amp Saatchi, KPMG, RBS, the civil service and advertising agency WPP.As part of the consultation on the race pay gap, employees will be asked to share their views on mandatory pay reporting. The government has admitted that the number of organisations publishing the information voluntarily remains low.The race pay gap reporting is intended to mirror elements of the gender pay gap regulations, proposing the same threshold of 250 employees or above for mandatory reporting.Announcing the new scheme, May said too often minority employees “feel they’re hitting a brick wall when it comes to career progression”. She said: “Our focus is now on making sure the UK’s organisations, boardrooms and senior management teams are truly reflective of the workplaces they manage, and the measures we are taking today will help employers identify the actions needed to create a fairer and more erse workforce.”Harman’s challenge to May on social equality comes in a lecture she is due to give on Thursday in Grimsby in commemoration of Anthony Crosland, the late Labour minister who represented the town in parliament for 18 years.In the talk, Harman will describe how Cameron mothballed clause one of the Equalities Act, which would oblige public bodies to act in ways that would “reduce the inequalities of outcome which result from socioeconomic disadvantage”.“Theresa May, in her first speech as prime minister on the steps of Downing Street, spoke of how she was determined to tackle what she called the burning injustice,” Harman plans to say. “But under her government, it’s getting worse. And, as has always happened with a Tory government, the possibility of those born at the bottom to rise up the ladder is becomes more remote.”Harman will add: “So my challenge to the prime minister is, if you mean what you say about tackling those burning injustices, if you are genuine in wanting to tackle lack of social mobility, then implement clause one.”Meanwhile, Labour has announced plans to boost teaching connected to black history in schools, along with the history of the British empire, colonialism and slavery. On a visit to Bristol marking Black History month, Jeremy Corbyn was to argue it is “vital that future generations understand the role that black Britons have played in our country’s history and the struggle for racial equality”. He was to say: “In the light of the Windrush scandal, Black History month has taken on a renewed significance and it is more important now than ever that we learn and understand as a society the role and legacy of the British empire, colonisation and slavery.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1e7e9bdeae636f9365666c21ac7b02d443ea71e/0_55_3062_1837/master/3062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca9be0ffbf1c1273b53d449b139fa2db","title":"nathan hughes in dark over england future after delay in disciplinary case wasps rugby union","story":"• Hughes’ hearing for punching mysteriously postponed• Wasps’ No 8 faces being banned for autumn internationalsNathan Hughes must wait up to a week to find out if he can play any part in England’s autumn series after his disciplinary hearing for punching was postponed in mysterious circumstances.The Wasps No 8 spent four hours in front of an independent three-man panel on Wednesday night only for the case to be halted after it was decided a delay was necessary “in order to deal with an issue that arose during the evening”.When asked for clarification on the issue in question, the Rugby Football Union declined to comment and Hughes is unable to play until a verdict is reached – almost certainly ruling him out of Friday’s Champions Cup clash with Leinster.“The independent panel appointed to deal with this case will reconvene within seven days in order to deal with an issue that arose during the evening,” independent panel chair Gareth Graham said. “No judgment will be issued by the panel in this period and the panel direct that the player, Wasps Rugby and the RFU are to make no further comment until the case has concluded.

In the ever-familiar world of Spanish football the domestic title has been won for 13 of the past 14 years by either Barcelona or Real Madrid, with only Atlético Madrid briefly interrupting the established hegemony. This year’s Champions Cup has a similar vibe before a ball is passed or kicked.Since 2011 just three teams have won Europe’s elite club trophy – Leinster, Toulon and Saracens. Substitute a fading Toulon for their French rival Racing 92, the most extravagantly backed French side in this year’s tournament, and you have the three main candidates for this season’s podium. As far as rugby is concerned, Europe is a shrinking concept regardless of Theresa May’s next move.This is not simply a consequence of the relentlessly high standards at Leinster and Saracens, two organisations apparently twinned in their desire to grow stronger every day. Talks are already happening behind the scenes to reduce the number of competing teams in the Champions Cup from 20 to 16 (it was 24 before 2014), partly to ease the pressure on the players’ groaning fixture schedule. Italian representation is now zero and the future direction of the tournament after 2022, when the current broadcasting deals expire, remains to be seen.It makes this season a crucial one quality-wise if the pan-European dream – and what a waste it would be if the best invention in the short history of the professional club game withers on the vine – is to be rekindled. The rugby, frankly, will have to be dazzling if the finalists can be predicted with reasonable confidence seven months in advance and shock away wins occur only once in a Leinster blue moon.The potential risk of deja vu, as things stand, is inescapable. Neither of the two early front‑runners in France’s Top 14, Clermont Auvergne and Stade Français, are involved this time and nor are La Rochelle, such a buccaneering, bold addition in 2017-18. Of the English contingent, it would be pushing it to describe Newcastle, Leicester or Bath as in-form contenders primed to tear down the houses of the continent’s aristocrats.Wasps and Gloucester will also swiftly discover their true worth when they face the champions of Leinster and Castres respectively on the opening weekend. Wasps already have some crucial absentees, the Friday weather forecast is not great and Leinster already have a record fifth European title in their sights. Gloucester, should they slip up at home against the French champions as they did against Harlequins last month, must then go to Thomond Park to face Munster. Start slowly and their Pool 2 challenge will already be over.Assuming Saracens can see off Glasgow and Lyon in the first two pool rounds, though, a home quarter-final should be well within the north London club’s capabilities. Last year they were undone by their rescheduled Monday aberration against Clermont, who beat them 46-14 at home and condemned them to a quarter-final in Dublin. “It re-taught us there is no margin for error in this competition,” said Mark McCall, their director of rugby. “It’s different from the Premiership, you can’t afford to slip up.”Watching Leinster subsequently overcome Racing 92 in Bilbao and take all the plaudits has also galvanised a Sarries squad who lifted the trophy for the preceding two years. “Nobody enjoyed watching the semi-finals and final which we weren’t involved in,” McCall said. “They’re an ambitious group who want to do well in both competitions and they didn’t enjoy watching the final. I think they believe we can do well in Europe this season. They know we’re good enough.”Going unbeaten through the entire pool stages, as Sarries did for the previous two seasons and Leinster achieved last season, also makes it less likely that the two heavyweights will have to meet before the final in Newcastle next May. The now-abandoned semi-final draw system used to increase that possibility but these days it is tougher than ever for the tournament’s minnows.For those aspiring to challenge the elite the battle cry is simple: go hard or go home. It would do wonders for the tournament if, for example, Glasgow or Edinburgh – Scotland have two participants for the first time in five years – could bag a munro or two. This is an overdue opportunity, too, for Cardiff Blues to reach the last eight for the first time in a decade following their thrilling win in last season’s Challenge Cup final.If not, the pool phase highlight may well be the ding-dong of a battle between Munster and Exeter for top spot in Pool 2. Both sides could well progress, with Exeter’s director of rugby, Rob Baxter, determined to ensure his Premiership-topping squad improve on their European record of qualifying for the knockout stages just once in five previous attempts.For the first time the Chiefs have been working specifically towards the Munster game for weeks, rather than cruising into Europe merely looking to replicate what they do in the Premiership. “Our home pool game against Leinster last year was the big influence,” Baxter said. “I don’t want that to happen again. I think what we do will work in Europe it’s just we have to do it really well.”Exeter are certainly worth backing to join Leinster, Munster, Saracens, Racing 92, Scarlets, Montpellier and Toulon in the last eight but, final-wise, a Leinster‑Saracens clash of the titans remains the likeliest endgame.

The lunatics are on the grass. Ten kilo bags of mixed gravel aggregate are two‑for‑one at your local Bumcrack Warrior Warehouse. And most alarming of all, starting with Wednesday’s rain‑ravaged first one‑day international in Dambulla, the cricket is now on commercial radio.When the news broke in April that TalkSport had outbid the BBC to take the radio rights for England’s tour of Sri Lanka the response was mixed. Reactions tended to veer between mild irritation at the loss, for a few months, of a much‑loved programme to wistful, sun-bleached nostalgia for a world shadowed with decay (cricket’s chief default setting to any news whatsoever, from signs of the impending apocalypse to news that the tea van by the pavilion has run out of Double Deckers). Mixed in with this was a degree of snobbery, concern about other voices, a different kind of tempo intruding into what has always felt like a much‑cherished private garden square.And yet, somehow, the world continues to turn. TalkSport’s opening stint at the first one-day international in Sri Lanka was all the things we were told it would not be: crisp, clear, fun and well put together not to mention almost entirely free of the sound of men talking about drills that give you all the freedom of cordless with the power of corded at a price you would not believe.It was classical stuff in many ways. Fifteen overs into the day the skies opened and it started to chuck it down, leaving the TalkSport team to fill and muse and chatter pleasantly enough over updates on the size of the puddles on the covers.English cricket has agonised over the shrinking of its “base” over the past few years. This is at least something new. On the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast – a programme that is essentially an extended afternoon lunch discussion interspersed with the great Alan demonstrating the full breadth of his research-led analysis by saying things like “let’s have a look at their next three fixtures” – it was intriguing to hear a minor ODI series being treated with the same hushed reverence usually reserved for José Mourinho saying something, or a want-away ace being linked with a stunning swoop.“And now we cross over for team news from Dambulla!” Alan declared at one point, prelude to a surprisingly urgent discussion of the significance of Liam Dawson’s selection as a third spinner. Er. Well. Let’s have a look, shall we, at Liam Dawson’s next three fixtures.And so we were off. The opening voice of the TalkSport cricket era was Mark Nicholas, a deeply reassuring presence. Nicholas may resemble the kind of roguishly handsome provincial double-glazing magnate who your wife is always a little too pleased to see at the country club mixed-doubles summer fundraiser but he is a an excellent broadcaster and a proper cricket man, in a sport where that is a good rather than a bad thing.Two obvious problems early on were the small number of adverts, a point of editorial principle you suspect after all the early sniping about gravel and van hire. Second, and perhaps related, was the inaccessibility of TalkSport 2 itself. Even in the middle of London and tooled up with an expensive DAB radio it was necessary to download an app just to find it.At which point you do wonder about the likely size of TalkSport’s audience. Not least when plenty will be drawn to the BBC’s competing offer, The Cricket Social, a Test Match Special-without-the-cricket format, which also kicked off on Wednesday morning.No doubt the most devoted fans will continue to miss TMS, which is, like so many parts of the cricketing infrastructure, an object of genuine, deeply felt affection. It takes time to generate the hugely engrossing level of familiarity TMS has with its presenters and its audience. For TalkSport Mark Butcher dished up his usual mix of insight and waspish wit. Mahela Jayawardene was an excellent addition as the day wore on, with a voice as elegantly soothing as his batting, a man who as a player always seemed to be gliding though more fragrant air.New voices, new energy, new platforms: cricket can always do with more of this. Not everyone wants to see their much-loved aunt taking up with a vigorous old rogue who drops his aitches and takes her out dancing the twist to all hours. But who knows, in the end it might just do her some good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00f7b2414eb4954b51f7f4604e815c3cbb7e65bd/524_139_3712_2227/master/3712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50861b2ca3a5ea468399217c6103719b","title":"print that broadway legend patti lupone sounds off","story":"Lloyd Webber? Trump? Madonna? Don’t get her started! As the goddess of the modern musical prepares to star in Company, she settles some old scores – and starts some new ones Patti LuPone is giving her radiator a good smack. “I can NOT figure out how the heat works here!” Lupone – the queen of Broadway, the goddess of the modern musical – bellows with the sort of fierceness that has driven people she’s worked with to hide in terror. “Is it hot or cold? I cannot figure out what’s going on in this country. I cannot figure what’s going on in my country, either. Oh my Gahhhhhd, don’t get me started!”We are meeting in the London townhouse where she is staying while appearing in Marianne Elliott’s hugely anticipated production of the Stephen Sondheim musical, Company, which opens next week. LuPone is a theatrical legend, a two-times Tony winner who was the original Evita on Broadway and the original Fantine in the London Les Misérables, her distinctive, powerful and emotional voice helping to turn their accompanying albums into mega-sellers.But LuPone gained an extra level of fame last year for her political opinions. In the summer, she was on the red carpet at the Tony awards when a reporter asked her why President Trump should come see her sing. “Well, I hope he doesn’t,” LuPone said, “because then I won’t perform.” “Really?” “REALLY.” “Tell me why,” the reporter said. “Because I hate the motherfucker, how’s that?” she replied. The interview immediately went viral.“Ha! That was something!” LuPone cackles. “I can’t stand the red carpet. It’s just so tedious and I’m not good on it because I will always speak my truth, and it’s not necessarily appropriate in the environment.”It is hard to imagine LuPone ever worrying too much about appropriateness. In the US, she is so famous she has played herself on Glee, Will \u0026amp Grace and Girls, always three parts brassy, one part terrifying and two parts hilarious, which turns out to be pretty much what she’s like in real life. “And that is the last time she fucked with a woman in a wig cap,” was one of her lines on Girls, and it is easy to imagine LuPone saying that for real.During our time together, she casually slays multiple reputations: “Hal Prince is the cruellest director I’ve EVER worked with! He’s a great stager, but a terrible director.” Prince is the 21 times Tony winner, who directed her in Evita in 1979. When I ask what she thought of Madonna’s performance as Evita, she replies: “Madonna? Euch! But I can’t really talk about Madonna. Madonna’s Madonna – I’ll leave it at that.” At one point, she describes an extremely famous person as mentally unstable, casually adding: “Maybe don’t print that because he once tried to sue me.” And as for Andrew Lloyd Webber, well, we’ll get back to him in a bit.Doubtless directing LuPone presents its own challenges. “I am exacting,” she concedes with pride, “and I push.” But listening to her is a hoot. “If someone has the talent they have the RIGHT to be temperamental. They complained about Bette Midler when she was doing Dolly, but she wouldn’t be exciting if she wasn’t temperamental. It’s only the ones who don’t have the talent and are temperamental who make you say, ‘Just get out of here!’” Who would dare argue?LuPone doesn’t just have high standards for herself and other performers, but also the audience. In 2009, she paused in the middle of performing Gypsy to call out an audience member for taking photos. In 2015, she descended from the stage and snatched a woman’s phone after LuPone saw her texting mid-performance. “I am fearless on stage. Not just to grab people’s phones – but I will do anything on stage, because anything can happen and the audience wants it to.”In her 2011 memoir, LuPone says she fell in love with acting at the age of four while in a school play. She realised: “Hey, they’re all smiling at me. I can’t get in trouble up here. I can do whatever I want and they’ll still smile at me.”Unsurprisingly, rare is the article about LuPone that does not include the dreaded four-letter word “a”. She twitches her head away at the mention of it, like she is flicking away a wasp. “It’s just because women are supposed to shut up, or not think those thoughts or talk back. It’s crazy. But talking back is something I’ve done since I was a little girl, and it’s always got me in trouble. Ha!”Which brings us to Company, Sondheim’s 1970 musical about a young man called Bobby who just can’t settle down, much to his bemusement and frustration. But for this production Elliott has swapped Bobby for Bobbie, played by Rosalie Craig. “I think it makes the show more powerful,” says LuPone. “It’s almost cliched for a man to be noncommittal, and Bobby was always a conundrum for me. I understand the character much better now, because the stakes are higher for women who wait.” LuPone married her husband, a cameraman called Matthew Johnston, when she was 39. They have one son, Joshua, a writer and actor.But it was the director’s gender that most intrigued LuPone: she hadn’t worked with a female director since 1977. “Which is insane. I mean, my GAHHHD.” So even though LuPone, now 69, had announced she would not be doing any more musicals, after a hip replacement, when Elliott offered her the role, she decided to postpone her semi-retirement. Was it worth it? “Oh, my God, yes!” she says, thumping the table. “We need more female directors and writers.”LuPone plays Joanne, Bobbie’s oldest and most cynical friend, who has some show-stopping numbers. As a role, it seems made for her, but when I ask whether she talked about it with Sondheim before coming to London she becomes uncharacteristically tentative. “Er, not with Steve, no. I don’t think I’m Steve’s first choice,” she says. But you’ve done so many of his musicals! “Well, that’s why. I’ve done so much by now.” I always imagined you two as having a close relationship? “Well, right NOW it’s good,” she says with a laugh. “We know each other socially, because we live near each other in Connecticut. But I have to be careful with him professionally, because he’s exacting.”You’re pretty exacting, too. “I try to be, but I’m not as exacting as him with the score, and he’ll let me know when I’m not. And there were times when it was hard to take. I think I’m really lucky in that I call the man Steve, and I’m working with a living composer, who happens to be Stephen Sondheim, and I don’t try to take it further than that.” Watching LuPone speak with caution is a little like seeing an elephant tiptoe through a china shop and we both relax when she gets to the end without any disasters.LuPone was born in Long Island, New York, the only daughter of first generation Italian immigrants. After her school introduction to the stage, she made it into the first-ever class of the Juilliard School’s drama ision. Also in her class was a handsome curly-haired man called Kevin Kline, with whom LuPone quickly became “entrenched in love”. The two were together for seven years until, as LuPone bluntly puts it in her memoir, “he slept with a chorus girl in Boston”.With more than a tiny amount of satisfaction, she says: “He was all over the place when we broke up.” Are they still friends? “Umm, we’re not enemies! We’re friendly, but friends are the people you call and see and hang out with, and very few of my friends are in show business.” After breaking up with Kline, LuPone was cast as the star of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Evita, an experience so difficult she once said it was “like Beirut”.“It was the thing that made me a star, but I had a terrible time. Oh my Gahhhhhd! That’s why I’m sort of counselling Rosalie. I know what it’s like to go through a trial by fire.” LuPone was so anxious about her singing, she practised until she lost her voice. During rehearsals, cast members tried to help by telling her how Elaine Paige had played Evita in London.“Shut up!” LuPone eventually snapped. “And,” she writes in her memoir, “a reputation was born.” Because, while it’s true that a woman gets called a a just for speaking up, it’s also true that LuPone’s memoir is studded with anecdotes about her telling people to go jump – and smashing mirrors in fury. “Why complain about someone who delivers?” she shrugs unapologetically, when I mention her reputation.But Evita was a walk in the park compared with the next time she worked with Lloyd Webber. In 1993, he cast her as Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard in London, which led to what is still one of the most infamous feuds in theatre. LuPone had expected to take the show to Broadway, but Lloyd Webber fired her and replaced her with Glenn Close. LuPone sued him over their agreement and she got more than $1m, which she partly used to build a pool behind her family house in Connecticut. She gleefully told everyone it was called The Andrew Lloyd Webber Memorial Pool.When LuPone performed Don’t Cry For Me, Argentina at the Grammys this year, it was widely assumed the feud was over, but such an assumption underestimates LuPone. “We haven’t made up, no. No! What he did…” Twisting the knife, she adds: “The poor guy – it seems to me he wants the kind of critical success Stephen Sondheim has.” LuPone was also furious with Glenn Close. It probably didn’t help that Kline had a relationship with Close after he and LuPone broke up in the 1970s. I tell her that I read last year in a New York tabloid that the two women went out for drinks and made up, and were then joined by Jon Hamm, Mad Men’s Don Draper, and Girls star Andrew Rannells.“That’s bullshit!” she says. “They got that ALL wrong. I was out with Andrew and Jon – and Glenn was at another table. Glenn came to us and she sidled on up to Jon Hamm. She needed to make herself known to Jon Hamm! Ha ha!” She laughs, casually plunging in another knife.Despite all evidence to the contrary, LuPone insists she’s ready to slow down. She has an Italian passport (“which means I belong to 28 countries!” she says, sticking the Brexit knife into me) and she dreams of travelling “this beautiful Earth” with her husband. “I want the quiet life,” she sighs longingly, then immediately goes into a furious rant about how “the Christian right in America is no different from al-Qaida. Print that, because someone needs to say it out loud!”And then, suspecting she’s just started another almighty row, she makes another big cackle.• Company is in previews at the Gielgud theatre, London, and opens next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85ac770d86772749fb3f91b44b31e945cad59bf4/0_0_4590_2754/master/4590.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e872c565eb67a2eefd5cf6f29276d69","title":"lenovo thinkpad x1 tablet review surface pro usb c","story":"Great screen, robust design, brilliant keyboard and Thunderbolt 3 make the third-generation ThinkPad X1 Tablet a potent combinationLenovo’s third-generation ThinkPad X1 Tablet aims to be a no-compromise Windows 10 detachable that gives users what Microsoft’s Surface won’t: USB-C and Thunderbolt 3.The form factor is familiar. The actual computer is squeezed into an 8.9mm thick tablet with a kickstand out the back and a magnetically attached keyboard that sits up on an angle for better typing.But here Lenovo departs from the winning minimalist Surface 2-in-1 formula, bringing ThinkPad staples such as a pointing nipple, trackpad buttons, bucket-shaped keyboard keys and optional road-warrior appealing 4G.That’s not to say this is a pure workhorse, but the matt-black paint job, ancient-looking ThinkPad logo and red highlights certainly give the impression this machine is about getting stuff done.On the back is a solid-feeling kickstand with a wide angle of motion, which is just as good as that on the back of the Surface Pro, and perfect for getting the right angle on your lap or desk.The front-facing speakers are perhaps a weak point for using the X1 Tablet as a media machine, because although they are relatively clear and distortion-free, they’re also not very loud and lack any sort of bass. They’ll be fine if you’re hand-holding the machine to watch a TV show, but watching something while cooking and hearing what’s going on over an extractor fan is a no-go.The X1 Tablet is designed to be more durable than most. The screen is covered in a sheet of Gorilla Glass, like most of the competition, but the ThinkPad line has a history of going the extra mile in testing against humidity, vibration and mechanical shock, meaning it should cope with the everyday jolts and jostles of commuting.The X series is Lenovo’s top-end ThinkPad line, which means the X1 Tablet comes with all the power you’re likely to want.That includes your choice of the latest eighth-generation quad-core Intel i5 or i7 processor, 8 or 16GB of RAM and plenty of storage.The machine as tested had a Intel Core i7-8550U processor, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage and 4G, and absolutely flew through everything I threw at it.While the integrated Intel UHD 620 graphics card may be the weakest point of the X1 Tablet, the machine managed to handle some enormous 23,000-pixel wide images without breaking too much of a sweat.The fans in the tablet fire up more often than some competitors, but they also don’t get particularly loud unless you’re doing something very processor-intensive. Most of the time they’re inaudible in an office environment.Overall performance is excellent, matching that of a high-end ultraportable machine, but don’t expect to do hardcore gaming on it – I didn’t try it with an external graphics card.One of the things that’s sacrificed in most PC tablets is battery life. Lenovo quotes “more-than-all-day” battery life of nine-and-a-half hours, but the reality is the ThinkPad X1 Tablet lasts only around seven hours between charges. That was with the “Better battery life” power setting active, word processing in Typora, browsing in Chrome, using Nextgen reader, some image editing in Affinity Photo and lots of email in Microsoft Mail.It’s enough to get through most of a day’s work, but isn’t enough to leave the charger at home on intensive days. Thankfully as it uses USB Power Delivery to charge, any USB-C charger with sufficient wattage should work such as those shipped with other laptops or even multi-chargers putting out 30W or more.The X1 Tablet comes with just two Thunderbolt 3 ports that double as USB-C ports. Having Thunderbolt 3 is a huge boon as the expansion capabilities are endless, including the holy grail of one cord to charge, connect a 4K monitor and every other peripheral you can think of. It’s a significant advantage over competitors that lack even USB-C.However, having only two ports, one of which will be needed for power, means you will rely on docks or hubs. It’s not such a big deal for most, but a bit of port-juggling is inevitable if you don’t invest in a dock of some sort.There’s also a microSD card reader, which is great, but it’s hidden in a sim-slot similar to that which you would find on a smartphone. It’s not practical as a hot-swappable memory card reader as you need a sim ejector tool to get it out, and it means ejecting the 4G sim if you’ve got one at the same time.Unlike Microsoft’s Surface Pro, the X1 Tablet comes with a keyboard, and what a keyboard it is. Windows 10 detachables such as this live or die by the quality of the keyboards, as most of the time they’re used like a laptop.Lenovo’s keyboard is the best I have used on any detachable, and better than the vast majority of laptops. The keys are full-sized, solid, feel great under your fingers and have enough travel to make for a comfortable, satisfying typing experience.The trackpad is equally good. It’s pretty big, has a smooth, precise surface and a solid click to it, as well as plenty of options to customise the experience. But there’s also a ThinkPad stalwart in the form of the little red nipple TrackPoint between the G, H and B keys, and three mouse buttons between the spacebar and the trackpad. I found little use for them except when on a train where the end of the keyboard was pressed up into my gut by the zero legroom blocking the trackpad.The keyboard does have its quirks, such as the Fn key in the bottom left corner instead of Ctrl, something I had to almost immediately switch round in settings for muscle-memory cut and paste. There aren’t any media keys either.The X1 Tablet has an IR-based facial recognition system that’s just as good as that on Microsoft’s Surface line. It recognises you from the lock-screen and automatically logs you in, making login seamless.There’s also a fingerprint scanner, which has a slightly odd combination of tapping and swiping for registering your fingerprint, but works well in day-to-day operation. I didn’t end up using it at the desk as the face recognition worked so well, but it was useful for unlocking the tablet when handheld in portrait orientation, and the more biometric options the better.The machine as tested cost £1,973.59 with a Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage and 4G.The ThinkPad X1 Tablet proves that Lenovo can make a great detachable 2-in-1 Windows 10 tablet computer. It’s not cheap, but offers similar or better specifications than its chief rival the Microsoft Surface Pro, including the much-needed modern port selection of Thunderbolt 3.The X1 Tablet feels like it can take a beating and will survive the rigours of mobile working, which is what it was designed for. The screen is great, and at 13in is an ideal size, the kickstand and keyboard are brilliant and performance is top-notch.The seven-hour battery life could be better, but the integrated 4G and two biometric options are welcome additions. It’s still a better machine for work than play, but it is good enough to pull double duty unless all you want to do is watch videos from across the room.If you’re in the market for a top-end 2-in-1 Windows 10 detachable, the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Tablet should be on your list.Cons: only two USB-C ports, microSD card reader not easily accessible, expensive This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Investigators searched the pair’s personal accounts but found no evidence that the information was then sent on to reporters.Meanwhile, an officer assigned to an FBI taskforce was found to have forwarded the British intelligence report to a foreign law enforcement official without permission, while a fourth employee tried to send it to their personal account through a banned automatic forwarding system.On 22 May 2017, Salman Abedi detonated a suicide bomb at the arena following a concert by the American pop singer Ariana Grande. The explosion killed Abedi and 22 others, while injuring many more.The inspector general’s report said the inquiry was prompted by a referral from the FBI itself, which said that an article published on 24 May 2017 contained sensitive information from the UK intelligence report. The FBI had already reviewed internal emails, text messages and telephone logs in an unsuccessful search for contacts with the reporter who wrote the article.The inquiry found that British authorities had sent the report to “numerous other” US agencies, suggesting the leak may not have come from the FBI."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be1e8f02d4830f3491b9bfb1e77787954bb92ea3/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1eb69e8b5b0955a100250215836f97d4","title":"negative political ads republican racism","story":"Expert says Donald Trump’s effective reliance on personal attacks have caused ‘racist and bigoted’ ads to become more prevalentNegative campaign advertisements are as familiar in US elections as door-knocking and yard signs. But as the 2018 midterm election campaign pulls into its homestretch, Republican attacks in two congressional races happening 3,000 miles apart have triggered alarm bells for targeting non-white candidates in an apparent effort to highlight their “otherness”.The first comes from California’s 50th district, where Ammar Campa-Najjar is running as a Democrat for a seat currently occupied by the Republican Duncan Hunter. NBC’s Chuck Todd, a veteran political reporter and commentator called the spot “maybe the most shocking and outrageous political ad I’ve ever seen”, in a Meet The Press Daily segment.The ad zeroes in on Campa-Najjar’s heritage – his mother is Mexican American and his father is Palestinian – calling him a “Palestinian, Mexican, millennial Democrat” who is “working to infiltrate Congress” and a “security risk”.“At best it’s desperate. That’s putting it mildly,” said Campa-Najjar, who also called the effort “blatantly ignorant” and “unhinged from reality”.Last Wednesday a bipartisan group of dozens of national security veterans decried the spot as a “racist and bigoted” attack. “The baseless allegation that he is somehow a ‘security threat’ is an affront to our professionalism as national security experts, our American values, and our collective national dignity,” the group said in an open letter.The ad accuses Campa-Najjar of being supported by the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood with no evidence, and despite the fact that Campa-Najjar is a Christian. “It’s just so interesting that we live in a world where Islamophobia even extends to non-Muslims,” Campa-Najjar told the .The rest of the ad is focused on trying to tie Campa-Najjar to his grandfather, Mohammed Najjar, who was a member of the Black September Organization which plotted the 1972 Munich Olympic massacre that killed 11 Israeli athletes and a German police officer.Campa-Najjar was born 16 years after his grandfather was killed by Israeli forces for his role in the attacks, but Hunter’s advert accused Campa-Najjar of changing his name to “hide his family’s ties to terrorism”.Campa-Najjar did recently change his name from Yassir-Najjar to Campa-Najjar, but has professionally gone by the latter for years, and said the change was to reflect the influence of his mother’s family, which primarily raised him.In a email statement to the , Hunter’s spokesman, Michael Harrison, declined to provide a source for the claims about the Muslim Brotherhood or the quote from Campa-Najjar’s father, but insisted that “the facts … raise national security concerns”.Harrison added: “any suggestion of racism or Islamophobia is completely contrary to the fact that Congressman Hunter has endorsed a Muslim candidate” in a different local race.Campa-Najjar, who worked at the labor department’s office of public affairs under Barack Obama, attributes the ad to desperation in a race that a recent LA times poll suggests may be tightening. While California’s 50th typically leans Republican, Campa-Najjar is buoyed by general wave of Democratic support and by the fact that Hunter was recently indicted on corruption charges, which he denies.“The fact is, there’s me, who was cleared by the FBI to work at White House, and there’s Hunter who was indicted by the FBI,” said Campa-Najjar. “So the law’s on my side and not his side as of late.”David Schweidel, a professor of marketing at the Goizueta Business School at Emory University said ads like this may increasingly be more en vogue in the post-2016 election climate largely because Trump’s well-documented reliance on personal attacks proved effective enough to win the White House.“We saw pundit after pundit kind of commenting on the fact that these personal attacks weren’t coming across as presidential and how ‘it’s the wrong temperament’. Well, guess what, people responded to it,” Schweidel said.Schwiedel was part of a research team that looked at the effects of negative political ads in a 2018 study. They found that negative advertising persists because, “as much as people say they don’t like it, it’s extremely effective”.He added that spots like Hunter’s are generally not intended to sway undecided voters, but to inspire the base to show up at the polls. As US politics continues its long slog towards ever-increased partisanship, elections become more about turning out the base and less about converting undecideds: which could mean negative and personal attacks only become more prevalent.On the other side of the country, attack ads on a black congressional candidate’s former career as a rapper have taken on racist undertones in a district that, like California’s 50th, is predominantly white. Antonio Delgado, a Harvard Law graduate and Rhodes Scholar is running as a Democrat for a seat in New York’s 19th district currently held by Republican John Faso.As a young man, Delgado released a socially conscious and political hip-hop album under the name AD the Voice in 2006.The ad also accused Delgado of “lacing his raps with extremist attacks on American values”, playing a clip where Delgado states, factually, that more civilian lives were lost during the Iraq war than the 911 attacks.Faso didn’t place the ads, but has not condemned them either, saying in a statement this summer that “Mr Delgado’s lyrics paint an ugly and false picture of America.”The subtext of the ads was seemingly illuminated in a New York Times article from July when Gerald Benjamin, a friend of Faso’s and director of the Benjamin Center at State University of New York at New Paltz, posed the question: “Is a guy who makes a rap album the kind of guy who lives here in rural New York and reflects our lifestyle and values?”He continued: “People like us, people in rural New York, we are not people who respond to this part of American culture,” eventually sparking protests from students at his home campus in New Paltz. Benjamin later apologized for his remarks.Delgado has said the ads are an effort to “otherize” him in the eyes of the white voters he needs to win.“It’s insulting to people in the district that Faso believes they will buy into this sort of deception and dishonesty,” said Delgado’s campaign manager, Allyson Marcus, noting that a similarly themed Super Pac radio ad was even pulled by the local radio station WDST, which called the ad “highly offensive” and “factually distorted” in a statement.“The truth is Antonio grew up in a working-class family in Schenectady, right here in upstate New York, where he learned the values of hard work and accountability. The real question is, why won’t Faso condemn these isive and deceptive ads,” Marcus asked.Faso did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a333e8c5f4e19aead9ceba0152fbe8bbf3f0074/0_218_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8c31ef594aef31189aa635e445aac8b","title":"santa cruz sinking climate change beaches surfing","story":"Similar challenges are sprouting up along the coast, and the golden sands and beach properties that define the state at riskOn a recent overcast October afternoon, yet another section of West Cliff Drive, the premier seafront street in Santa Cruz, California, was roped off as workers toiled to prevent it from crumbling into the Pacific Ocean.The erosion gnawing away at this prized road, and the famed surfing beaches it overlooks, is emblematic of the relentless threat that climate change poses to California’s coastline. As the sea level rises and storms of growing strength smash into the coast, the golden sands and beach properties that have come to define the state are at risk.“I think with every coastal road in California, you’re going have to think about relocating it,” said Gary Griggs, an earth sciences professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz.West Cliff Drive, which sits on an elevated bluff, hugs the coast near Santa Cruz’s 111-year-old boardwalk en route to a nature reserve thick with eucalyptus. The street’s beach houses and towering villas are regularly valued beyond $2m, with some vacant plots of land fetching $1m.“Coastal property values are way inflated, factoring in all the risk involved,” Griggs said. “West Cliff Drive is the place to be now lots of people who made money in Silicon Valley have moved there.”Santa Cruz sits on the northern lip of Monterey Bay, which is losing several feet of beach a year. Sections of the cliffs beneath West Cliff Drive are abutted by piles of rocks, known as riprap, placed as a last-ditch attempt to stem erosion.There is only one house on the ocean side of the road, and its owners moved in recently. “They didn’t have any idea what they were getting into,” said Griggs, who is doing consulting work for the owners amid a tussle with authorities over riprap earlier put in place without permission. “The seawater keeps rising. In the long run, the main beach in Santa Cruz will certainly be lost, if nothing is done.”Similar challenges are sprouting up along the California coast, particularly in the south of the state. Up to two-thirds of southern California’s beaches will completely erode by the end of this century if there aren’t “large-scale human interventions”, according to a major report released by the state government in August. Around $48bn worth of property will be at risk should the swelling sea level increase beyond 4ft.“If we continue the path we are on there will be significant loss of beaches,” said Madeline Cavalieri, a program manager at the California Coastal Commission. The response to morphing coastlines will have to involve a combination of “protection, accommodation and retreat”, she added.This scenario is particularly painful for a place like Santa Cruz, which draws its cultural and economic strength from its beaches and pounding waves.According to local lore, three visiting Hawaiian princes introduced surfing to the city in 1885, when they rode the waves in longboards milled from local redwood. Surfers from around the world now descend upon Santa Cruz to spots such as Steamer Lane, where a rip hurtles into a sandstone bluff that has been in retreat since the last ice age and is now guarded by an array of rocks. A former lighthouse, now a surfing museum, overlooks surfers scrambling over the rocks and into the foaming water.“If you ask a surfer, it’s very apparent that climate change is real and is happening right before our eyes,” said Nick Muchas, who has lived and surfed in Santa Cruz for the past 15 years. Muchas frets about surfing spots that will suffer as the coasts recede, leading to overcrowding at the better areas, as well as the impacts on land.“West Cliff Drive is our cherished road, it’s our treasure chest, and every winter we can see the whole cliff is becoming more unstable,” he said. “When the surf and spray comes over it, I’d say it’s treacherous.”Erosion has shaped California’s coast since long before mass industrialization started pumping planet-warming gases into the atmosphere. A rock arch near the lighthouse collapsed in the late 19th century, with just a stump remaining now. A separate rock formation, known locally as “the old shoe”, is now more like the bottom of a heel.But climate change is accelerating this process. According to a city climate plan, more than 70 Santa Cruz buildings are expected to be at risk from flooding within 12 years with 4in of sea level rise. By 2100, this grows to 390 residential and 65 commercial properties, along with seven miles of roads. This would come with “high rates of beach and coastal bluff retreat”, the document states.Along about a tenth of the California coast, the response to this threat has been to erect seawalls or dump protective rocks. While this may buy time for expensive low-lying infrastructure – waste water treatment plants, power stations, the airports at San Francisco and San Jose – the barriers can exacerbate the loss of beaches.As the sea level rises, beaches would naturally migrate inland with the retreating coastline. But fixed points such as seawalls prevent this shift, trapping and in effect drowning the sand as the sea rises and storms take their toll.Roads, sidewalks and buildings also provide a barrier, which presents a conundrum for cities such as Santa Cruz that want to avoid the opposing financial cataclysms of losing their beaches or having to relocate buildings and people en masse to safer ground inland.The hard choices won’t be deferred for much longer. California’s coastal commission has been pushing Santa Cruz to come up with an erosion plan for West Cliff Drive and the city is turning to residents for feedback.More defences may be erected some areas may have to be abandoned. The state is keen on “green” solutions – seeding wetlands or other vegetation to slow the tides – but that is tough to do in Santa Cruz, with its steep cliffs and hefty waves.The retreating coastline isn’t the only climate challenge Santa Cruz, like many coastal locations, is facing. Heatwaves threaten the sick and elderly, while lengthening wildfire seasons risk choking the city with smoke. The city, already unaffordable for many residents, could see a future influx of people seeking to escape from baking temperatures inland.“I would say we are on the leading edge in terms of understanding our risks and being proactive and addressing them,” Wise-West said. “It’s a pretty daunting topic, though.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/465ceb6b8f8566051dab6e79dbe65131bd8583b8/0_198_2971_1784/master/2971.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df32d44b068d2cab4f48f11af00672bb","title":"indonesia official tsunami search ends relatives keep digging","story":"Many may never find relatives swallowed up as the ground liquefied, but one woman says she will continue ‘with hammers and a hoe’Villages in disaster-hit Palu have been transformed into mass graves as Indonesian authorities halted official large-scale search operations on Thursday – with thousands still believed to be missing.In the areas of central Sulawesi affected by the tsunami and 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck less than two weeks ago, the decision has left people angry, distraught and anxious for closure.Ade Irmayanti, 33, has been searching for her six-year-old nephew, Muhammad Gibran, in Palu since the disaster.In Palu’s hills, in the village of Balaroa, the six-year-old and his seven-year-old cousin, Sahdan, had called out to their grandmother, telling her they were going to a nearby stall to buy some snacks. That was the last anyone in the family saw of the boys.Every day since, the family has searched high and low, erecting posters all over the city of Gibran, in his red and white school uniform. “You could say I have been to every hospital and every shelter in Palu and outside by now,” Irmayanti told the . “I don’t know how many, it could be hundreds.”There has been no news of Sahdan, but the family did get information that Gibran may have been evacuated to the southern city of Makassar so they are holding out a sliver of hope.While Irmayanti has visited shelter after shelter for the more than 82,000 people displaced in the disaster, Gibran’s father has worked with search and rescue teams amid the ruins of the village, directing an excavator to piles of concrete rubble where he believes the body of his son could be.Irmayanti said “her heart dropped” upon hearing the news the official search ended on Thursday. “We will continue to look for him ourselves,” she said, defiantly. “With hammers and a hoe.”Indonesia’s national disaster agency has decided to halt large-scale search and rescue efforts, citing concerns over the spread of disease and the increasing difficulty of retrieving decomposing bodies from the mud and debris.In areas such as Petobo and Balaroa, more than 3,500 homes were destroyed. Hit by a phenomenon known as liquefaction, entire swathes of Petobo were sucked into the earth and then sealed over with mud. The instability of the land and rubble, worsened by continuing aftershocks, has made the work of search and rescue teams a dangerous task.The disaster agency said the areas would be cleared and eventually be turned into parks and memorials.The official death toll from the successive disasters has now topped more than 2,000, mostly victims of the tsunami that lashed the coastline of Palu and outlying areas such as Donggala.Hundreds had gathered on Talise beach on the day of the disaster for the opening night of the Palu Nomoni cultural festival, a colourful event featuring traditional music, dance and rituals. Some fled after the quake hit but not everyone – tremors are not unusual in Palu – and there was no word a tsunami was on the way.Even as the national disaster agency issued a tsunami alert from the capital, several thousand kilometres away in central Sulawesi there were no sirens on the beach, no official warning to evacuate and seek higher ground. Survivors say the first of three powerful waves hit within 10 minutes.The morning after, the coastline was strewn with corpses, but the complicated nature of the disaster, which entombed many in their homes in nearby villages, has obscured the true toll.This week the disaster agency said that, based on reports from local village chiefs, there could be 5,000 people missing from Petobo and Balaroa, although these are yet to be accounted for in the official figures. With the search called off apart from some small-scale efforts, many could be presumed dead.Officials say the focus will now be on relief operations, ensuring the thousands of displaced and injured have basic supplies and medical care.There is also talk that residents in upended villages will be relocated, although nothing official has been announced yet. Experts say some areas, such as Balaroa, were never suitable for development in the first place.Overcome with grief, Irmayanti says the family can’t think that far ahead yet. Their priority is trying to find Gibran, dead or alive. “What we want is certainty,” she said, “If Gibran is alive, knowing where he is. And if is he dead, knowing where the body is.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ac583c5d91e2bd19658a279896d6a0eed67b8c5/0_140_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ccac2877665b9791ec2de06895c9db6","title":"salvadoran priest oscar romero saint pope francis canonisation","story":"The canonisation of the assassinated archbishop will take place on Sunday in RomeOscar Romero, the Salvadoran priest who championed social justice for the poor and dispossessed, will be proclaimed a saint by Pope Francis in a canonisation ceremony in Rome on Sunday, almost four decades after he was assassinated by a rightwing death squad.The former archbishop of San Salvador, who was closely associated with the Latin American liberation theology movement of the 1960s and 70s, will be canonised along with six others at the ceremony in St Peter’s Square. They include Pope Paul VI, who oversaw the sweeping Vatican II reforms of the Catholic church in the 1960s.For years, conservatives within the church sought to block Romero’s canonisation because of his association with liberation theology, a movement whose followers argued that it was not enough for the church to empathise with and care for the poor. Instead, they said, the church needed to push for political and structural changes to eradicate poverty, even – some believed – if this meant supporting armed struggle against oppressors.Clare Dixon, head of the Catholic aid agency Cafod’s Latin America region, said: “Oscar Romero is revered in his native El Salvador. He ranks alongside the likes of Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi as one of the most remarkable figures of the 20th century.“His canonisation will give Romero the wider recognition he so richly deserves. He denounced the violence which was tearing his country apart, he spoke out against oppression, and stood against injustice alongside people living in poverty.”Father Robert Pelton, a Romero expert at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, said the Latin American priest was a “wonderful pastoral example to the world”. He added: “I’m surprised how long it took to finally get to the truth about him.”Francis began the process of declaring Romero a saint soon after becoming pope. About 250,000 people attended Romero’s beatification ceremony – the penultimate step towards becoming a saint – in San Salvador in May 2015.Earlier this year, the Vatican’s Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared that a miracle had occurred following Romero’s intercession – the final step before being proclaimed a saint. A 34-year-old pregnant Salvadoran woman, who had been diagnosed as terminally ill, gave birth safely and recovered completely after prayers by her family and her church seeking Romero’s intercession.Romero was shot through the heart by a sniper while celebrating mass in a hospital chapel on 24 March 1980, a day after he had called on the military to stop killing innocent civilians in El Salvador’s dirty war. Numerous death threats had been made against him.At his funeral, the army opened fire, killing dozens of mourners in a crowd of more than 100,000. His murder came at the start of a 12-year civil war, in which more than 75,000 people were killed and thousands disappeared.Dixon said that diplomatic and political pressure had been exerted on the Vatican in the years following his death to block efforts to have Romero made a saint. It was not until after the election of a leftist president in El Salvador in 2009 and Pope Francis becoming pope in 2013 that the issue of Romero’s canonisation was “pulled out of the deep-freeze”.The former archbishop was “revered and reviled, loved and loathed” in El Salvador, “and that continues to be the case in a country which is still deeply polarised,” she said.Nevertheless, the Catholic church would be “going absolutely crazy” this weekend celebrating the canonisation, with parties scheduled for the early hours of the morning to coincide with events in Rome.In his diaries, Romero wrote: “Between the powerful and the wealthy, and the poor and vulnerable, who should a pastor side with? I have no doubts. A pastor should stay with his people.” His sermons, demanding social justice for poor people and excoriating politicians and military leaders, reached hundreds of thousands of people via radio broadcasts.Francis, the first Latin American pope, was never a liberation theologian, and criticised aspects of the movement when he was a priest in Argentina, according to papal biographers. But since becoming pontiff, he has argued that the church must champion the poor and marginalised, and has repeatedly criticised capitalism and consumerism."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3659882.1539240638!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"storm callum orange alert issued as storm set to batter ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMet Éireann has issued a status orange weather warning for Storm Callum, which will hit Ireland on Thursday night. File photograph: Cyril ByrneThe weather warning has been issued for counties Dublin, Louth, Wexford, Wicklow, Meath, Cork, Waterford, Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Clare and Kerry. The warning is in place from 10pm on Thursday until 9am on Friday. A yellow wind warning is in place for Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Longford, Offaly, Westmeath, Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim, Roscommon, Limerick and Tipperary. Met Éireann meteorologist Siobhan Ryan said there is the potential for higher gusts locally. “The strongest winds will be all around the coast of Ireland but with a particular emphasis on Atlantic coastal counties and there will be rain accompanying it too,” she said. “An orange weather warning is not to be underrated, it is a severe weather warning. Late Thursday night until Friday, there is the possibility of localised flooding. You’re going to see some violent gusts up along the coast potentially. “All the obvious things apply - stay away from exposed coasts, drive slowly in the anticipated crosswinds. The trees are still heavily leafed at the moment so there is the potential for further trees to fall.” A yellow weather warning has also been issued by the UK Met Office for Northern Ireland with severe gales expected between 3am on Friday and 12am on Saturday set to cause some disruption.The Met Office cautioned that winds would bring a “small chance of injuries and danger to life from flying debris” and that there was “a slight chance of some damage to buildings, such as tiles blown from roofs”. It said some roads may close due to the strong winds and that there was a chance of power cuts.The Met Office also advised people on Northern Irish coastal areas to take care as “large waves” could occur during the storm with beach material being thrown up onto sea fronts.Fingal County Council said on Wednesday night it has activated its Crisis Management Team and Severe Weather Alert Team in response to the status orange severe weather warning issued by Met Éireann.It said the crisis management team had a conference call 6pm on Wednesday which was chaired by Chief Executive Paul Reid. The next meeting is scheduled for 1pm on Thursday. “At the moment Met Éireann is forecasting that strong winds coinciding with high spring tides will affect Ireland with winds gusting between 110 and 130 kmh along coasts. High tide along the Fingal coast during this period will be at approximately 2am on Friday morning so there is the possibility of flooding in vulnerable areas,” it said. It added that council crews will distribute sandbags on Thursday to areas along the coast where flooding might occur and details of sandbag distribution points will be available on Thursday from the council’s operations team on the following numbers: Balbriggan Swords: (01) 89055958905596 and HowthMalahide: (01) 8906260It has asked for reports of people sleeping rough on Thursday evening to be telephoned to 1800 707 707 or posted online at http:www.homelessdublin.iereport-rough-sleeper Meanwhile the Road Safety Authority (RSA) has asked road users to exercise caution during Storm Callum. Before the storm arrives Thursday will be cloudy and breezy with fresh and gusty winds. The rain in the southwest and west will become widespread during the morning with heavy falls in places and the risk of isolated thunderstorms. Brighter conditions with showers will follow from the southwest during the afternoon and evening. Highest temperatures will be between 13 and 16 degrees. Heavy rain and extremely windy conditions will sweep in off the Atlantic on Thursday night, possibly stormy in some west and northern coastal areas. There will be possibly thundery rain in many places overnight, with strong to gale force southeasterly winds developing, giving way to squally showers and strong to gale force south or southwesterly winds by Friday morning. Coastal flooding is also likely, due to the combination of high seas, high tides, strong winds and low pressure. However, Met Éireann said conditions should abate fairly quickly on Friday afternoon with drier weather developing for a time. Another spell of very heavy, possibly thundery rain will push northwards later on Friday, and rain will be widespread on Friday night and for a time on Saturday but turning drier and fresher later in the day and overnight. Sunday is due to be a bright and fresh day with cooler conditions. There will be sunny spells and scattered showers, with some possibly heavy and prolonged showers in western areas later in the day. Galway City Council says it is installing its “aquadam” at Spanish Arch in the city centre, due to the risk of overtopping of the river Corrib in very high astronomical spring tides. It says its weather assessment team will continue to meet and monitor the potential impact of Storm Callum.During Storm Ali last month, which claimed two lives, wind speeds of over 140kmh were recorded at Mace Head in Connemara early on September 19th, with peak gusts between 7am and 8am.

Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsThe number of women affected by the CervicalCheck scandal is likely to increase beyond the 221 women currently identified by the Health Service Executive (HSE).This is because an impending review of smear tests by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) is looking at a substantially wider cohort of women than has been examined by the HSE.The RCOG review covers all women with a screening history for the past 10 years whereas, it emerged yesterday, the HSE appears to have restricted the number of cases it examined.Dr Gabriel Scally, who carried out the scoping inquiry into the CervicalCheck controversy, described the criteria used by the HSE to determine which women were affected as “flawed” and predicted more women may be affected.Dr Scally and Dr Karin Denton, a UK consultant cytopathologist who also worked on the review, told the Oireachtas health committee they were still unclear what criteria the HSE used to select the group of 221 women. Dr Scally said he and Dr Denton were still seeking clarification from the HSE.The issue relates to the cut-off point used by the HSE to determine the impact on women whose smear test was misread. In 2015, a decision was made that if a woman was diagnosed with cancer more than 18 months after a false negative smear then that may have affected the management of her diagnosis. Dr Scally said the 18-month cut-off point differed from practice elsewhere and was “undoubtedly flawed” and it was “hard to see the logic for it”.Dr Denton said they didn’t know whether the cut-off point was subsequently revised and what definition was used in deciding which women to contact.Asked for clarification, a HSE spokeswoman said it was co-operating with Dr Scally and that further light on the issue would be shed by the RCOG review, which is expected to examine about 3,000 smear tests.Health sources say the task of sourcing information about the approach taken by CervicalCheck became more difficult following the resignation of its clinical director, Dr Gráinne Flannelly, last April. Dr Scally was appearing before the Oireachtas health committee for the first time since his report on the CervicalCheck controversy was published last month. The report dealt with the failure of the screening programme and doctors to tell women about a retrospective audit that showed smear tests were incorrectly interpreted, potentially preventing them from receiving earlier treatment. Of the group of 221 affected women, 20 have died.At the start of the meeting, members observed one minute’s silence for two of the women who died at the weekend, Emma Mhic Mhathúna and another, unnamed patient. Ms Mhic Mhathúna was buried in Co Kildare yesterday.Dr Scally said he was saddened by the deaths, adding they served as a timely reminder of how serious cervical cancer is and of the need to make the disease an increasingly rare event in the future.A spokesman for the Minister for Health said the Scally report called for a more robust audit process to be enforced. The Minister intends to ensure that recommendation is implemented.“It is important to state that all women with a screening history over the past 10 years will have their slides reviewed by RCOG. This will provide those women with independent, clinical assurance.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3659144.1539200781!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"scally questions hse criteria in cervicalcheck controversy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Gabriel Scally said in his report  that the decision to view 18 months as the cut-off for clinical impact was ‘undoubtedly flawed, and it is hard to see the logic for this’. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill  The The news that the number of women affected by the CervicalCheck controversy may be higher than the 221 people currently identified is likely to cause considerable alarm.Once again, it seems, the numbers are shifting, in a further underscoring of the absence of reliable data that has been a feature of this controversy since April.At the height of the controversy in the spring, the HSE was at first unable to say just how many cases existed where the audit of the CervicalCheck programme showed the woman’s test could have provided a different result.Eventually, it settled on a number of affected women – 209 – but this number crept up so that by July it stood at 221. Now, it seems almost certain the total will rise further, according to Dr Gabriel Scally, the Northern Irish public health specialist who led the scoping inquiry into the controversy.Why is this happening? The background is that, as Dr Scally noted in his report published last month, “a complete presentation of audit outcomes has been impossible to locate”. Estimates are being drawn on the basis of incomplete information, it seems.More specifically, an issue has arisen as to the criteria used by the HSE to determine whether women should be included in the “group of 221” patients (as it currently stands) whose outcome may have been affected by a false negative smear test.When CervicalCheck carried out a review in 2015, screening tests that were carried out more than 18 months before the date of a woman’s cancer diagnosis were held to have potentially influenced the management of her treatment. So if the test produced a false negative, the outcome for the woman could have been different.Dr Scally said in his report last month that the decision to view 18 months as the cut-off for clinical impact was “undoubtedly flawed, and it is hard to see the logic for this”.He repeated the point at the Oireachtas health committee on Wednesday and revealed that he still doesn’t know whether the HSE used this criterion, or some other one, in determining whether women would be included in the “group of 221”.Contacts are continuing with the HSE to ascertain the methodology actually used, but in any case the review currently being undertaken by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of about 3,000 smear test slides is almost certain to throw up new cases. This is because it is examining a greater number of tests than were ever looked at by the HSE.It is important to make the point that we are not looking at any new cases of women receiving a cancer diagnosis, but in some instances a test could have provided a different result.Almost six months on since this scandal broke, many questions have been answered in Dr Scally’s report but troubling issues remain to be resolved.

Photograph: Getty images More than 630 Irish people have been deported from Australia over the last two years according to figures released by the Australian Department of Home Affairs.Overstaying a visa, having a visa cancelled or invalid visas were the most common reasons for their deportation.The Irish Australian Support Association in Queensland (IASAQ), a group that helps Irish people in Australia, said changes to visas had left people in “a grey area” and they were not surprised by the figures.A spokesperson for IASAQ, Paddy Farrelly told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland the changes came as a “shock” and some Irish people in Australia have “fallen between stools”.Earlier this year, Australia scrapped its skilled 457 visa programme, which had allowed tens of thousands of Irish workers to enter the country legally. The visa changes were announced in 2017 by then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull who said he wanted “to put Australians first.”There were allegations that the 457 visa was being misused by employers to import workers “on the cheap” and not to fill genuine skill shortages.The 457 visa was replaced with the Temporary Skill Shortage Visa (TSS), however, the list of occupations that qualify for TSS, was significantly reduced.Mr Farrelly said the transition from the 457 to TSS can be difficult as the new visas are limited, expensive and have an intimidating amount of paper work.He said dozens of people are turning to the Irish Australian Support Group looking for help with visa issues.Melbourne-based Immigration law expert Rick Gunn also told Morning Ireland many people are taking a risk and living undocumented. He said the Australian government was deporting immigrants if they believe they do not have “good character”.Mr Gunn said he recently represented an Irish man held in immigration detention for two months after authorities discovered he did not disclose a minor conviction in Ireland.“The incident was very upsetting for the man and his family.”He urged people to be “upfront and honest” about prior convictions, no matter how minor, when entering Australia.The Irish Australian Support Group urged anyone experiencing visa problems to contact them."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3658822.1539199050!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"calls for live and let live outside ashers in central belfast","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGerry Moriarty visited Ashers minutes after the London Supreme Court ruling. Photograph: Charles McQuillanGetty Images. There were no customers inside Ashers shop on Royal Avenue in central Belfast when, on Wednesday morning, I presented myself seeking opinions about the “gay cake” London Supreme Court judgment in favour of the bakery. It was shortly after 10am, minutes after the court found that the bakery had not discriminated against gay rights activist Gareth Lee, whose order in 2014 for a cake with the message “support gay marriage” was initially accepted but then rejected by Ashers.The three staff behind the counter did not want to talk, which was fair enough as that was the company policy when I sought reaction after previous court judgments in this long-running battle. They were probably sick of the sight of me, I thought.The shop is diagonally across from the gutted remains of the Primark store and just outside the cordon. Inside the security tape all stores are closed for safety reason. There were very few people about on one of Belfast’s premier shopping thoroughfares. It was rather sad like walking down an almost empty Grafton Street in Dublin.I planted myself to the side of the shop with notebook and recorder. Even though Royal Avenue was quiet, there was a steady stream of customers of different ages, and from unionist and nationalist backgrounds. And all the sympathy was with Ashers, although occasionally with a little qualification.Sam Clarke, who is in his early 30s, runs a picture-framing business nearby that is feeling the pinch because of the lack of customer footfall. He had heard the legal costs would be about £350,000 (€400,000). “For 350 grand I think it is a big waste of money and I could have used it a lot better,” he said. Costs are actually expected to be in the region of £550,000 (€600,000).Holding his sausage and bacon roll smothered in red sauce, he said he felt that people should be able to put any message they wanted on a cake. But then again, he said, if Ashers “believe it is against their beliefs then I wouldn’t want to force someone to do something against their beliefs”.And he added: “Me personally, if I wanted to get a cake made and the business did not want to do it, it would not bother me. I would go somewhere else that would be more happy to do it. There should be more live and let live from both sides.”Chris and Linda Killen from Lisburn went into the shop for a sausage roll. They know the McArthur family who own Ashers. “Today has been the right judgment,” said Mr Killen. “At the end of the day it was exactly what they stated: they had no problem with the man, it had to do with the message. If you knew the family, you would know they are not discriminatory people, they are nice people.”Peter Morgan, a middle-aged man from a nationalist background, said he was “delighted” with the result. He felt taking such legal cases against the company was “an infringement of the human rights” of the McArthur family. “It would be like a loyalist band going to a baker on the Falls Road and asking for a loyalist emblem on the cake,” he said.He thought too that the managing director, Daniel McArthur, and his wife Amy had conducted themselves with great dignity. “They did not come across as if they had anything against anybody. They had an attitude of live and let live, and I was glad to see that they pushed it to the limit and won the case.”Then the police arrived. Here I must stress that was my fault, because I had not properly explained when I went into the shop that I was a reporter. After I explained my position and the police departed, a smiling member of staff came out. “Are you trying to get me arrested?” I asked. “No, we’re not,” she laughed. “We didn’t know you were a journalist.”She explained that as soon as the judgment was announced, a stream of “abusive” phone calls started coming in that staff had to field, and she thought I might have had sinister intentions.Just as with the PSNI officers, we parted amicably. I then spoke to a few more customers leaving Ashers and again the prevailing view was that the case against Ashers demonstrated a lack of common sense.“It was splashed all over the news, and over a cake – that’s the bit that I can’t understand, for a small cake, it’s just not right,” said Elizabeth from the Antrim Road. Another middle-aged woman who did not wish to ulge her name said she was a Christian although her views “may not be in parallel” with the evangelical opinions of the McArthurs. On balance she felt the judgment was correct. “Conscience still has to have a place in society, conscience has to be respected,” she said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3658933.1539188285!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish government review in wake of grenfell tower blaze limited","story":"The politan Police have released pictures and video footage of the burnt out remains of Grenfell Tower in London.

The Government’s response to the Grenfell Tower disaster has been “very limited” and a wider fire safety review of buildings at risk in Ireland should be ordered, an Oireachtas committee will be told today.Orla Hegarty, an architect and assistant professor of architecture at University College Dublin, will tell TDs and Senators that hospitals, airports, schools, shopping centres, student housing and hotels need to be examined.“I have been following the UK response to the Grenfell fire closely. By comparison, the response in Ireland has been very limited. There has been no regulatory change signalled or guidance issued to building designers,” she will say.Seventy-one people were killed when the blaze engulfed the tower block in Kensington, west London, on June 14th last year.Latest Irish figures, to be revealed at the hearing, will show fire-safety improvements have yet to be completed at 35 high- and mid-rise buildings identified as at risk. This is up from 19 cited by Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy last month.“Public safety concerns are legitimate,” Ms Hegarty will tell the joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government which is examining a countrywide fire-safety review.Ms Hegarty will say current legislation on fire safety – the Building Control Act – was drafted in response to the Stardust nightclub tragedy in Artane, north Dublin, on St Valentine’s Day in 1981, in which 48 people died.Since then, buildings have become “larger and more complex. Housing is being built more densely the materials that are being used are becoming lighter, more combustible, more toxic and less forgiving of poor design, unskilled workers and inadequate testing and control system.”The Stardust and Grenfell blazes were “foreseeable and preventable”. And “it should not take a tragedy to act when the risks are evident and preventable”, Ms Hegarty will say.Mr Murphy ordered a fire-safety review of 842 buildings last year, following the Grenfell loss of life. It indicated that 291 are fitted with cladding systems. External cladding has been implicated as an accelerant in the Grenfell blaze.However, Ms Hegarty will say combustible cladding “is only one part of a bigger story”.Mr Murphy has said the work is ongoing."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3659223.1539208651!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ministers criticise naughten s handling of broadband controversy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDenis Naughten, Minister for Communications, announcing details of the National Broadband Plan at Government Buildings last year. File photograph: Cyril ByrneThe  Ministers have expressed concern about Minister for Communications Denis Naughten’s handling of controversy over meetings he held with the lead bidder for the Government’s National Broadband Plan.One Cabinet member said the “drip feed of information” on meetings between Mr Naughten and David McCourt, chairman of Granahan McCourt, was “not helpful”.Another said: “If he broke the rules, he’s in trouble.” The issue was described as the “second fool’s pardon he’s looking for”, a reference to a controversy earlier this year over contact between Mr Naughten and a lobbyist working for Independent News and Media.Mr Naughten’s spokeswoman, however, pointed to comments from an official heading up the broadband procurement process who said contacts with Mr McCourt had “no bearing”.Fianna Fáil communications spokesman Timmy Dooley said Mr Naughten should acknowledge the “inappropriateness” of the meetings.The Minister, he added, should answer further Dáil questions on the issue but said the issue was “bigger and wider” than the latest controversy, adding the broadband process was “fatally flawed”.Mr Naughten admitted he met Mr McCourt on two separate occasions and “facilitated” a lunch in the Dáil for him while the procurement process was ongoing. The Minister also paid for the €37 lunch through a direct debit Oireachtas system, which deducts payments from salaries, his spokeswoman said.Mr Naughten was already in hot water for accepting a dinner invitation from Mr McCourt in New York in July, which he attended with several senior officials from his department.Mr McCourt’s company is in line to secure one of the biggest public contracts ever awarded by the State, worth in excess of €500 million, should it succeed in winning the tender.When asked at a post-budget briefing on Wednesday if he had met Mr McCourt on any other occasion during the procurement process, Mr Naughten initially said he didn’t recall.However, after being passed a handwritten note by a senior department official, Mr Naughten corrected his initial statement to say that he had attended a meeting in Dublin with Mr McCourt and the secretary general and the assistant secretary general of the Department of Communications in June."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3659252.1539205757!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord naughten runs for cover under close questioning","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Communication Denis Naughten’s protestations that he didn’t stay for lunch brought lovely memories flooding back of the Mahon tribunal. Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe  The Minister for Communications sat next to the Taoiseach. Both men looking very glum.The Fianna Fáil leader dropped the T-bomb into the conversation, a brave thing to do for a Fianna Fáil leader.“Now,” he said ominously to Leo Varadkar, “we’ve had tribunals about this type of thing in the past”.“Down with this type of thing” is what we say . The horror of recent tribunals is still too raw to contemplate any reruns.But not Denis Naughten, the Minister for Communications, who has taken a leaf from the Stevie Wonder songbook and doesn’t worry about a thing.The last thing was in April. That’s when Denis had a cosy chat on the telephone with a well known PR man of the lobbying kind, who also happens to be a pal through rugby and an acquaintance from the PR man’s days as a government spin doctor.The old pal rang the Minister to shoot the breeze about the proposed takeover of a media group by the major media group (Independent News \u0026amp Media) he was representing. And the Minister shared his “private” opinion on the current state of play.Denis Naughten nearly lost his job when that thing came out. He had to explain himself to the Dáil.He confessed his main fault is that he is too “accessible” to people, pointing to the fact that his mobile phone number was up there for all to see on his website.With hindsight, the Minister ruefully admitted that perhaps he shouldn’t have taken the call and sincerely regretted his actions.“Decision makers such as Minister Naughten are properly and normally insulated from lobbying and any attempt to influence them during a tendering process” said the Fianna Fáil leader.That isn’t a quote from April.He said that on Tuesday.Another type of thing has come up for accessible Denis, this time to do with social encounters, with the man leading the sole bid to roll out broadband to every part of the country.It’s a mega-million euro contract for whoever gets the nod.Hence the need to fully insulate Ministers involved. Who can forget everything that happened after the country’s second mobile phone licence was handed out?Arms length, insulation, belt, braces and bargepole should now be deployed as standard by Ministers within sniffing distance of anyone or anything to do with a tender or takeover while the process is still active. It should be instinctive.Unfortunately, it seems Denis is somewhat short in the instinct department. To put your foot spectacularly in one compromising business situation may be regarded as a misfortune to do it twice looks like carelessness. And that’s the kindest interpretation.It recently came to light that the Minister attended a dinner in New York in July hosted by the boss of the investment company in pole position to win the broadband contract. The dinner was “a social event” although a number of his officials briefly discussed the bid with David McCourt.The issue came under scrutiny in the Dáil, causing more of a stir than the budget, which had everyone yawning in the aisles.Martin devoted his slot at Leaders’ Questions to the dinner. But the issue was raised earlier during ministerial questions, when dinner morphed into a fascinating investigation of lunch.Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley wanted to know if Naughten had lunch with David McCourt in Leinster House on April 18th. In fact, Timmy was “able to confirm” that the businessman lunched there on the day in question.But was Denis there too?And what was going on? Timmy was astonished that such a meeting would have taken place on the very day – and this was the icing on the investigative cake – that the Minister was being hauled over the coals in the chamber over his ill-judged call to his rugby pal, the lobbyist.“Why, in God’s name” wondered the TD, did he allow himself to be embroiled in another such incident?The Minister’s response to the Fianna Fáil man, and to the other spokespeople, was curious and very cagey.First, he said he didn’t attend the lunch. Then he said it was his “understanding” that McCourt and his family had been in for lunch that day.But it was in the Members’ restaurant, Dooley reminded him. Might the appointment be in his ministerial diary?Might be, but he didn’t know, replied the Minister.Sinn Féin’s Brian Stanley and Solidarity’s Paul Murphy chipped away at his story. But the Minister remained determinedly vague.Finally, Fianna Fáil’s James Brown, a barrister by trade, had a go.Under heaving questioning, the Minister revealed that he made the booking for lunch. Guests must be signed into the restaurant by an Oireachtas member.He “facilitated” the family coming into Leinster House, “as many colleagues do.” David McCourt wanted to bring his daughter on a tour of Leinster House and then bring her to lunch for her birthday.The businessman lives in the Merrion Hotel when he is in Dublin. At least they didn’t have far to go for lunch.But if they did, perhaps they might have hired a driver to take them to Dáil. Denis could of done the honours.Naughten’s protestations that he didn’t stay for lunch brought lovely memories flooding back of the time in the Mahon tribunal when a man called Michael Wall, who was very generous indeed to Bertie Ahern when he was a minister, attended a function in Manchester in Bertie’s honour. But he didn’t really, because, as he explained to the tribunal, “I didn’t eat the dinner”. He just drove the bus.Denis didn’t eat the lunch.Did he eat the dinner in New York?Micheál Martin is not happy with the whole affair.“I mean, people externally looking into this country might be tempted to say now that the key to getting a lucrative contract in Ireland is face time with the Minister . . . It is extraordinary, Taoiseach, that this has occurred and in my view the Minister has contaminated the process.”He read out the issues discussed in New York between officials from the department and McCourt. They were dismissed by Leo Varadkar and Naughten as “administrative” matters.Then he did his Jack Nicholson impression.“Like, this is the meat!” he cried, slapping the printed page with his hand. “This is the GODDAMN meat of the bid!”We hoped he would follow up with, “You can’t handle the truth!” But he didn’t.Denis, meanwhile, was still gingerly handling the truth.It turns out he paid for David McCourt’s lunch.It cost €37. Although that’s not what the opposition will be saying in the days to come."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3658839.1539198650!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach defends minister meeting key bidder for 500m contract","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t  Denis Naughten  confirmed he made the  booking for lunch at Leinster House for    David McCourt  and his family but did not meet Mr McCourt, on the day. File photograph: Alan BetsonThe The Taoiseach has dismissed claims by Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin that Minister for Communications Denis Naughten “contaminated” the rural broadband tendering process by meetinga key member of last remaining consortium bidding for the €500 million contract.Leo Varadkar defended Mr Naughten’s meeting in New York in July with US businessman David McCourt and said it was acceptable “provided it conferred no advantage on Mr McCourt”.Earlier Mr Naughten told the Dáil he did not attend a lunch in Leinster House on April 18th with Mr McCourt. He said Mr McCourt, founder and chairman of Granahan McCourt, and his family came into the house for lunch that day to celebrate a birthday.He was questioned by Fianna Fáil communications spokesman Timmy Dooley, his party colleague James Browne, Sinn Féin communications spokesman Brian Stanley and Solidarity TD Paul Murphy on this.Mr Naughten said the booking for the lunch was made under his name but “I did not speak with David McCourt either in person, on the phone or any other way that day or on subsequent days in relation to that”.Mr Martin later raised the issue of the New York meeting in July and said meetings like this had led in the past to the establishment of tribunals but the Taoiseach rounded on him and accused the Fianna Fail leader of having a history of making allegations against ministers.He said Mr Martin had made false allegations against him and Minister for Health Simon Harris in relation to the CervicalCheck controversy but had refused to withdraw his claims when proved wrong by the Scally inquiry. “This is a pattern by you, unfortunately not a good one.”The Fianna Fáil leader said it was significant that at the New York meeting, officials handling the bid for the department were not in attendance.The Taoiseach said the contract would be one of the biggest investments in rural Ireland providing high speed broadband to more than 500,000 homes and businesses. He said the meeting in July in New York was at a dinner hosted by the McCourt family. Mr McCourt had been a significant investor in Ireland for many years, employing hundreds of people. The Taoiseach said the tender was not discussed and it was a “short discussion of an administrative nature”.Mr Martin insisted the meeting was not of an administrative nature and the minutes showed four issues were discussed including changes in the make-up of the consortium. “This is the meat, this is the goddamn meat of the bid,” he said.“A Minister should not have met a key bidder in the context of a massive project and a State contract with hundreds of millions of euro at stake”.Decision makers such as Mr Naughten “are normally and properly insulated from lobbying and any attempt to influence them during a tendering process”, Mr Martin said.The Cork South-Central TD said that at this stage a decision still had to be taken on whether to accept the remaining bid.Claiming “it is beyond question that the bid is contaminated”, Mr Martin added: “He was canvassing, he was lobbying and canvassing disqualifies.”The Taoiseach said that “there is a single bidder so competition is not a factor here” and the meeting on July 16th took place before the evaluation of the bid had started.Accusing Mr Martin of having a history of making allegations against ministers, the Taoiseach asked if he was really saying that over a two or three year period as Minister Mr Naughten should not meet the chief executives of Eir or Airtricity or the chairs of RTÉ or TG4 when decisions were made about the funding of those bodies.The National Broadband Plan - the Government’s longstanding plan to address the lack of broadband coverage in rural Ireland - was first announced in 2012. The Government’s procurement process, which is ongoing, has been dogged by controversy. Not only have the pre-race favourites - Eir and ESB-Vodafone joint venture Siro - dropped out but the last remaining consortium keeps changing.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill If Poles thought “taoiseach” was a difficult to pronounce, Leo Varadkar should familiarise himself with “zboczenie” – the Polish word for perversion.That was the term used to describe him on Polish television last May, five days after Ireland’s abortion referendum.On Yes or No, a popular current affairs show on private broadcaster Polsat, discussion of the Irish vote took an unexpected turn.Host Agnieszka Gozdyra introduced the segment by describing the vote as a revolution in a country “often compared to Poland because . . . of its Catholicism”.By comparison, the host said, Poland’s ongoing campaign to limit abortion – headed by her anti-abortion guest Kaja Godek – indicated Poland was heading in the opposite direction.Ms Godek described the Irish result as the work of “abortionists” censoring Ireland’s anti-abortion campaign before the vote, both on traditional and social media.“I want to say with strong conviction that Ireland cannot be described as a Catholic country,” she said, considering its prime minister was “a self-declared gay, who shows off his bizarre orientation”.As the other panellist laughed, Ms Godek asked “if pre-natal tests show that an embryo is homosexual, can you actually abort it?”Poland is a long way from Ireland on LGBT rights. With no marriage equality or civil partnership, gay rights campaigners sense a growing backlash against them, spearheaded by right-wing lobby groups and backed by the national conservative government.In August, Poland’s interior minister described a gay pride parade as a “march of sodomites”. On Monday another gay pride march, scheduled for this weekend in the eastern city of Lublin, was cancelled by the mayor.A 2015 report by the Council of Europe, the human rights body, complained that Poland’s criminal definition of hate speech does not incorporate sexual orientation as grounds for prosecution.Given this climate, Ms Godek’s remarks have been taken up by group of LGBT people in Poland as an opportunity to seek a court decision on where the line is drawn between freedom of expression and hate speech.For Warsaw law professor Jakub Urbanik, the case is about testing what he calls the “Crying Game defence” – named after Neil Jordan’s 1992 film.“In it the transsexual character says ‘a girl has to draw the line somewhere’,” said Prof Urbanik. “That remark in turn paraphrases eminent English judge Lord Denning. We need to draw a line in Poland.”In general, Polish defamation law allows only the affected person to take action against alleged violations of their personal rights.But there are exceptions. This case hinges on the moment Ms Godek was asked if she was saying all homosexuals – not just Mr Varadkar – were perverted. Her answer: “Yes, yes . . .”In their 50-page filing, submitted on Wednesday, the 16 complainants list legal precedents they see in international and Polish law to allow them – as homosexuals – to sue her as injured parties.In 2004, a Polish priest was awarded damages because he felt defamed by a satirical article about Pope John Paul II. Defamation of the pope, the Polish court ruled, “may violate personal rights . . . of a clergyman who feels bound to the pope”.In a 2016 case, a Nazi concentration camp survivor from Poland won a case against German public broadcaster ZDF for referring mistakenly to “Polish” camps.Court documents filed on Wednesday in Warsaw mention Mr Varadkar at length, but trial procedure in Poland does not require complainants to submit a full list of witnesses at this stage.However, the group behind the legal action are enthusiastic about the idea of inviting the Taoiseach to testify.Marriage equality campaigner Aleksandra Muzinska insists the case is not about whether or not Mr Varadkar’s homosexuality is a “perversion”, but about raising awareness of inequalities faced by Poland’s LGBT community.“I wanted to be part of this lawsuit because I think I have a privilege to represent LGBT people in Poland,” she said, “especially those who don’t have means or opportunity to sue Kaja Godek.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3659928.1539245995!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar to be a named witness in case taken by 16 lesbian women and gay men","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOne of the complainants in the case Jakub Urbanik outside court. Photograph: Marek MisiurewiczTaoiseach Leo Varadkar is to be a named witness in a defamation case against a Polish anti-abortion campaigner who described the politician’s homosexuality on television as “perversion”.The libel action was filed on Wednesday at the district court in Warsaw against Kaja Godek. On May 30th, in a television discussion following Ireland’s abortion referendum, Ms Godek said she was not surprised by the outcome of the vote given Ireland’s prime minister had flaunted his “bizarre” sexual orientation and shown “his perversion to the people”.Asked by the host if she was saying homosexuals were perverted, Ms Godek continued: “Yes, yes. If the prime minister of Ireland declares that he has a male sexual partner, if it is accepted as normal, it is monstrous that such a country should be defined as a Catholic country.”In later remarks she described Mr Varadkar’s homosexuality as an “ailment”, prompting a robust response from co-panellist Katarzyna Piekarska, a left-wing politician and Warsaw city councillor.“You should be ashamed of yourself that you define a person with a different orientation as a pervert,” she said.Ms Godek is co-founder of the Life and Family Foundation, behind two recent attempts to tighten Poland’s already restrictive abortion laws.She is being sued by 16 lesbian women and gay men, including LGBT rights activists and professors of law, who say they are injured parties.Aleksandra Muzinska, a co-president of the Love Does Not Exclude movement, described Ms Godek as “a symbol of homophobia in Poland”.“She is becoming more aggressive and we are trying to stop her because enough is enough,” she said.

The majority leader of the US Senate also does a vivid line in Southernisms: his support for Brett Kavanaugh, whom he navigated on to the supreme court, was as “strong as mule piss”.And there, his outwardly interesting characteristics end. Grey of hair and persona, the distinguished side of 70, McConnell blends into the collage of Republican life so well that you wonder if a country club is missing its chair of governors. His indistinctiveness allows the craftiest politician in the land to work in relative stealth.And to nation-changing effect. With a one-seat margin in the Senate, he has populated the judiciary with conservatives, secured the highest court for the right and passed an improbable tax cut. He fleeced Barack Obama of his last supreme court nominee and changed the rules to install Donald Trump’s first by a bare rather than super majority.He survived the Tea Party’s cull of mainstream Republicans, as well as low approval ratings in his own Kentucky. His passage from state-level moderate to operational arm of Trumpism has been bourbon-smooth. This summer he became the Senate’s longest-serving Republican leader.On Monday, two years after he refused, on principle, to confirm a justice in an election year, he said that one could be confirmed in 2020, proving once more that unembarrassability is the trick to political survival.For Democrats, he is cynicism in human form. Another word for it is politics. The left should learn from McConnell even as it abhors him. With its command of Hollywood, academia and other weather-setting industries, it has come to regard practical politics as distasteful, or at any rate optional.Its current darlings are leftwingers – Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren – or such charismatic performers as Senator Cory Booker. Even Nancy Pelosi, a supple tactician in her time, who navigated Obamacare through the House of Representatives, is cherished more as a believer in things.Democrats will sigh that, yes, they are just too civilised for their own good. The party of Tammany Hall and Lyndon Johnson should avoid such self-regard. Chuck Schumer, McConnell’s opposite number, set himself against Kavanaugh as soon as he was nominated. The triangulating Clintons were no rubes.It is the developing trend of the party, not its record, that suggests a certain innocence. Among its Washington corps of politicians, fewer and fewer are masters, as McConnell is, of procedural arcana. What knavery it used to have was often learnt in the unions. The tone of the party is now set by younger and more educated activists who treat politics as a matter of first principles, not mechanisms – as a cause, not a craft.For all that Democrats fear Trump, the GOP has but one of him. It has little McConnells everywhere. Diligent cadres at state and local level work to eke out partisan advantages in electoral boundaries and voting rules. In next month’s midterm elections, Democrats will need a handsome win in the popular vote to take the House.This is down to their voters’ geographic distribution, but also to lost duels over map-drawing in back rooms and town halls at the start of the decade. Before it is a shining city on a hill, the US is an excruciating thicket of rules and processes. It rewards attention to detail and a patience for grunt work. It is unforgiving to dreamers.In It’s Time to Fight Dirty, David Faris, a political scientist at Roosevelt University, says that Republicans have for decades used ambiguities in the constitution to rig politics in their favour. Democrats cannot bank on an oblivious electorate to punish them. Instead of waiting for justice, he wants the party to dispense with Marquess of Queensberry rules itself.His analysis is too kind to the Democrats. His ideas, which include court-packing and the dismemberment of California to yield more senators, are too brazen: it is precisely the abstruseness of Republican tactics that allow them to pass undetected. But his ultimate insight – into a worldly right, and a guileless left – is becoming truer with time.After November, Democrats will comb their ranks for a leader who can “connect” with voters in 2020, as if that has been their failure all this time. Their presidential candidate has lost the popular vote only once since the end of the cold war. The party’s problem is not a lack of mass appeal. The problem, as McConnell might put it, is that it knows less about politicking than a hog knows about Sunday. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000177321713_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"never forget face long dont see 5000 lifetime study university","story":"People can remember up to 10,000 faces, with the average person able to recall around 5,000, a new study has found.For the first time, psychologists have devised a method for estimating how many faces a person can remember.The “facial vocabulary” comprises both people known personally to an inidual and famous faces such as those of celebrities and politicians.A team at York University developed a laboratory technique based on a theory called recognition and recall that showed everyone fell within the 1,000 to 10,000 range.This is despite humans typically living and interacting in groups of smaller than 100 throughout evolution.For the study, 25 participants spent an hour writing down as many faces from their personal lives as possible, including those they went to school with, colleagues and family.They then did the same for famous faces.The participants found it easy to come up with lots of faces at first, but harder to think of new ones by the end of the hour.That change of pace allowed the researchers to estimate when they would run out of faces completely.The participants were also shown thousands of photographs of famous people, such as Barack Obama, and asked which ones they recognised.The researchers required participants to recognise two different photos of each person to ensure consistency.How good is your memory? Take our test to find outDr Rob Jenkins, who led the research, said: “The ability to distinguish different iniduals is clearly important - it allows you to keep track of people\u0027s behaviour over time, and to modify your own behaviour accordingly.The range could be explained by some people having a natural aptitude for remembering faces.There are differences in how much attention people pay to faces, and how efficiently they process the information.Alternatively, it could reflect different social environments - some participants may have grown up in more densely populated places with more social input.End of the Saturday job as survey shows teenagers half as likely to have a weekend job than parents\u0026#39 generationOfsted to drop focus on exam results because curriculum is a \u0026#39casualty\u0026#39 of current system, chief inspector saysTories risk repeat of poll tax backlash over Universal Credit roll out, warns Sir John MajorStrictly\u0026#39s Seann Walsh breaks his silence on cheating scandal: \u0026#39I\u0026#39m not the person I\u0026#39m being portrayed as\u0026#39Two Britons killed in Majorca floods named as married couple in their 70s whose taxi was washed awayPrincess Eugenie\u0026#39s Royal wedding procession route: Where to watch the newlywedsRoyal wedding guest list: Who have Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank invited?How to watch Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank\u0026#39s Royal wedding on TV tomorrowWest must deploy intelligence agencies to defeat poachers, says Gabon presidentPrincess Eugenie\u0026#39s royal wedding: Time, date, details and latest newsThe real reason why Camilla is not going to Princess Eugenie\u0026#39s weddingPatisserie Valerie boss said \u0026#39not all fraudsters are evil\u0026#39 weeks before £20m went missingTony Blair says research shows Chequers plan almost as bad as no-deal Brexit for services sectorFrom runaway sheep to shocking cliffhangers: how tame Emmerdale turned into Britain\u0026#39s best soapHurricane Michael: Record-breaking storm leaves trail of devastation in Florida and GeorgiaComment: I\u0026#39m alone, but not lonely – shutting the door on the world is what keeps me saneEmma Rice interview: \u0026#39I’ve had some dirty, inappropriate things happen to me at work – it\u0026#39s been bloody marvellous\u0026#39Comment: Let’s take back control from unelected rulersDonald Trump demands \u0026#39answers\u0026#39 from Saudi Arabia over missing journalist Jamal KhashoggiWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/10/TELEMMGLPICT000111038848_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"alone not lonely shutting door world keeps sane","story":"The number of Britons travelling on their tod is up by almost a thirdForget separate bedrooms, the secret to happiness is separate living rooms Britons are increasingly going it alone, whether they are alone or not.

must deploy intelligence agencies defeat poachers says","story":" President of Gabon Ali Bongo OndimbaElephants and other endangered species could be driven to extinction unless Western governments begin to take the illegal wildlife trade as seriously as terrorism or drug running, the president of Gabon has warned. Ali Bongo Ondimba, whose country is home to the world’s largest surviving population of forest elephants, called for an international intelligence and law enforcement effort to break up the transnational criminal groups who now dominate the trade in ivory. “You still have people not believing that we can one day wake up without any African elephants. They say ‘oh, you’re exaggerating this’. But in the meantime, it is happening,”  Mr Bongo told the  . “We cannot win this battle alone,” he said.  “We are being confronted now by a real network of illicit traffickers. It is an organised one, and it does not just end with wildlife. They are moving into gold, they are moving into human trafficking,” said Mr Bongo. Mr Bongo and the Duke of Cambridge will be among dignitaries attending international conference on the Illegal Wildlife Trade in London on Thursday. The conference is the flagship event of a British-led diplomatic effort to put an end to a poaching crisis that has seen Africa’s elephant population plummet. Scientists estimate just 415,000 elephants survive in Africa following a poaching crisis driven by rising disposable incomes and demand for luxury goods in east Asia. Over 100,000, or 20 percent of the population, had been lost in the decade up to 2016, according to the last comprehensive estimate.  The trade in illegal wildlife products, including ivory, rhino horn, and pangolin scales, is estimated by the United Nations to be worth £18 billion annually. Conservationists and law enforcement officials working across Africa say the trade is now controlled by increasingly sophisticated and well-funded criminal gangs who operate across borders, and often enjoy high-level protection from corrupt officials. A previous conference held in London in 2014 led to a ban on the ivory trade in China that came into force on January 1 this year. China is traditionally the largest market for contraband ivory, and the conservationists hope the move will mark a turning point in the crisis. But the crisis is far from over. Mr Bongo said his government estimates it lost up to 25,000 forest elephants - about a third of the population - in a roughly five year period between the middle and end of last decade. Soldiers in Botswana inspect the carcass of an elephant following reports 87 had been killed by poachersMr Bongo said the focus on militarization and law enforcement would be insufficient without measures to mitigating human-elephant conflict and ensuring that local communities both understand and benefit from the economic value of a living elephant population. He said he wanted to see major arms exporters, including the UK, US, and Russia, be more careful about who they sold weapons to. Poachers are using incredibly powerful weapons, and they are getting them from somewhere. But we need more cooperation between intelligence agencies to find out exactly where they are getting them from and who is supplying them, he said. Gabonese wildlife rangers are engaged in firefights with poachers about once a month. The British Army runs a training program in the country to equip them to face often heavily armed poachers. Lee White,  the British head Gabon’s national parks agency who runs a counter-poaching task force, said Western governments remain reluctant to allocate intelligence or investigative resources to breaking up the syndicates armed gangs work for.  “The guys we end up fighting in the parks are basically cannon fodder. They’ve been press ganged by criminal gangs. Unless you go up the chain you’re not going to end it,” said Lee White, He said his team had seen “tentative” engagement on intelligence from the United States and France, but none from Britain. He said a joint operation with French intelligence late last year resulting in the simultaenous arrest of a network in several countries was a first and could provide a model for future cooperation. Mr White said he has seen the price per kilogram of ivory paid to front line poachers fall from roughly $200 to $100 in the past two years, possibly signalling that the crack down on the trade in China was having an impact. A LCpl from 2 Rifles trains Gabon National Parks Agency Guards as park of a British army anti-poaching program Conservation charities on Wednesday called on governments to establish vetted, multi-agency task forces that have the mandate and capacity to tackle high level traffickers.International wildlife trafficking is a form of serious organised crime and a worldwide scourge which threatens to impoverish our planet by causing the extinction of many life forms as well as the destruction of habitats, said Ian Douglas Hamilton. No single NGO or even government can tackle IWT alone.The Elephant Protection Initiative, set up by 18 African governments after the last London wildlife trade conference in 2014, called on donor to commit one billion US Dollars over the next 12 years towards elephant conservation in Africa. “Africa has set out an ambitious programme of elephant conservation,” said John Stephenson.  If we invest one billion dollars by 2030, we can put elephants beyond the risk of extinction, protect habitats, and help communities who live alongside wildlife.”Representatives of EPI countries, including Gabon, Tanzania, and Botswana, will discuss their national strategies with the Duke of Cambridge at a closed session this afternoon. Please review our commenting policyEnd of the Saturday job as survey shows

with\u0026nbspBalloon was shredded by a mechanism hidden within its own frame in front of a stunned audience in London on Friday night.Banksy, whose true identity remains unknown, celebrated the prank with a post on Instagram with the caption: “Going going gone”.“It appears we just got Banksy-ed,” said Alex Branczik, Sotheby’s senior director and head of contemporary art.The 2006 artwork, which depicts a girl reaching out to a red heart-shaped balloon and is one of Banksy’s most iconic images, was valued at around £300,000 but eventually sold for £1,042,000.As the gavel went down to signal the end of the auction at 9pm, an alarm went off and the canvas began sliding downwards through the frame.It emerged at the bottom sliced into ribbons, prompting officials to rush in to take the artwork from the wall in a doomed bid to save it.Sotheby’s described the surprise as “instant art world folklore” and said it marked “the first time in auction history that a work of art automatically shredded itself after coming under the hammer.”The auction house said that the successful bidder was “surprised by the story” and added: “We are in discussion about next steps”.Last year, the musician and DJ Goldie appeared to let slip that he was called Robert, an apparent reference to Massive Attack member Robert del Naja.The artist first achieved notoriety\u0026nbspwith a series of graffiti

These figures more closely resemble a company’s balance sheet.The IMF said the cost of bailing out banks had been a significant factor dragging the UK down the rankings. The UK also has one of the largest pension liabilities of any nation in the study but is towards the bottom of the pile when it comes to public assets.Using the public sector balance sheet method, countries such as Gambia, Uganda and Kenya rank above the UK because, while they have smaller assets and liabilities than Britain, they have a higher net wealth relative to GDP.The IMF’s report takes particular aim at the privatisation of public assets, the benefits of which it says are often merely an “illusion”.UK economy grows faster than expected in three months to AugustUK economy lost out on £4.5 trillion because of ‘too much finance’Does low-skilled immigration really hurt the UK economy?Remaining in EU better for UK economy than any kind of Brexit says IMFA decade after the financial crisis, the economy needs urgent reformThe UK has undergone one of the most drastic privatisations of any economy since the early 1980s.\u0026nbspUnder the Conservative government since 2015, policy has gone a stage further, incentivising departments and local authorities to sell off assets to fund day-to-day spending under the premise that such an approach is necessary to cut the deficit.But the IMF economists said the tendency of governments to focus on debt “misses large swaths of government activity and can fall victim to illusory fiscal practices”.When public assets are taken into account, selling a public utility,\u0026nbspfor example, may do nothing to improve the public finances, the IMF said.“For instance, privatisations increase revenue and lower deficits but also reduce the government’s asset holdings,” the report stated.\u0026nbsp“Similarly, cutting back maintenance expenditure reduces the deficit and lowers debt, but also reduces the value of infrastructure assets, which could cost more in the long term.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Scotland\u0027s First Minister and leader of the Scottish National Party, Nicola Sturgeon acknowledges the applause as she delivers her keynote speech to delegates on the final day of the SNP annual conference in Glasgow Anna Richardson and Alastair Campbell pose with their portraits at Let\u0027s Talk, a photography exhibition created in partnership with Mental Health UK at Regent\u0027s Place in London.

These figures more closely resemble a company’s balance sheet.The IMF said the cost of bailing out banks had been a significant factor dragging the UK down the rankings. The UK also has one of the largest pension liabilities of any nation in the study but is towards the bottom of the pile when it comes to public assets.Using the public sector balance sheet method, countries such as Gambia, Uganda and Kenya rank above the UK because, while they have smaller assets and liabilities than Britain, they have a higher net wealth relative to GDP.The IMF’s report takes particular aim at the privatisation of public assets, the benefits of which it says are often merely an “illusion”.UK economy grows faster than expected in three months to AugustUK economy lost out on £4.5 trillion because of ‘too much finance’Does low-skilled immigration really hurt the UK economy?Remaining in EU better for UK economy than any kind of Brexit says IMFA decade after the financial crisis, the economy needs urgent reformThe UK has undergone one of the most drastic privatisations of any economy since the early 1980s.\u0026nbspUnder the Conservative government since 2015, policy has gone a stage further, incentivising departments and local authorities to sell off assets to fund day-to-day spending under the premise that such an approach is necessary to cut the deficit.But the IMF economists said the tendency of governments to focus on debt “misses large swaths of government activity and can fall victim to illusory fiscal practices”.When public assets are taken into account, selling a public utility,\u0026nbspfor example, may do nothing to improve the public finances, the IMF said.“For instance, privatisations increase revenue and lower deficits but also reduce the government’s asset holdings,” the report stated.\u0026nbsp“Similarly, cutting back maintenance expenditure reduces the deficit and lowers debt, but also reduces the value of infrastructure assets, which could cost more in the long term.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Scotland\u0027s First Minister and leader of the Scottish National Party, Nicola Sturgeon acknowledges the applause as she delivers her keynote speech to delegates on the final day of the SNP annual conference in Glasgow Anna Richardson and Alastair Campbell pose with their portraits at Let\u0027s Talk, a photography exhibition created in partnership with Mental Health UK at Regent\u0027s Place in London.

Our forecast is for growth of 1.3 per cent, which would be the weakest annual expansion since the financial crisis.”The ONS reported that year-on-year, UK GDP growth slowed to 1.5 per cent in August, down from 1.7 per cent in July.In August itself the ONS estimates that manufacturing output fell 0.2 per cent and that construction slipped back by 0.7 per cent.Separately, it reported that the goods trade deficit was larger than expected by City analysts, at £11.2bn\u0026nbspup from £10.4bn in July.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

According to our estimates, that could suppress wage growth by over 0.25 percentage points each year,” he said.The remarks come at the end of the worst decade for inflation-adjusted average pay in almost 200 years (described by Mr Haldane\u0026nbspas a “lost decade”) and when the Labour Party is pledging to give trade unions a major boost in order to “restore the balance of power in the workplace”.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told Labour’s conference last month that a future Labour government would extend union rights to part-time and temporary workers. He has also said he will roll out “sectoral collective bargaining” across the economy.Mr Haldane, in his speech at an ACAS conference in London, also echoed another Labour critique of the modern workplace, by suggesting that the rise of insecure work and zero hours contracts was holding back pay by acting as a disincentive for people to move jobs (or “twist”), something that has been traditionally associated with a pay rise.“One of the side-effects of structurally-higher job insecurity is a reduced willingness to add to that uncertainty by moving job,” he said.“If so, this would mean ‘twisters’\u0026nbspare fewer in number than in the past and that stickers are at an even greater pay disadvantage to twisters as their outside option has lost value. In short, job insecurity reduces workers’ pay power and weakens upward pressure on pay.”Mr Haldane\u0026nbspidentified other factors that have dragged on UK pay growth in recent years, including the growing market power of large firms and automation.However, he struck a more optimistic note about the immediate prospect for pay growth saying that we may be witnessing a “new dawn” for pay growth due to the exhaustion of slack in the economy, something that should compel employers to lift pay awards.According to the Office for National Statistics nominal annual average pay growth, excluding bonuses, was running at 2.9 per cent in July, still well below pre-financial crisis growth rates.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Pre-tax profit dropped 4 per cent to £134m from £140m although trading profit was up 3 per cent to £163m from £158m last year. Group revenue was flat on a like-for-like basis. Stephen Clarke, WH Smith’s chief executive, said the group had a good year on the high street, “despite the well documented challenges of the UK high street”. The second half of the year was particularly encouraging, Mr Clarke, as “the business traded well and we quickly identified the latest trend in the market, becoming a one-stop-shop for all slime related products”.What is slime and is it dangerous?The new craze seeing parents inadvertently burn their childrenWH Smith slammed for selling toothpaste at £8 a tube in hospitalWH Smith shows how to be a high street survivorSlime products have surged in popularity in the last 12 months, becoming a must-have plaything for children, although some consumer groups have warned of safety risks. \u0026nbspDespite the boost to business from slime, WH Smith’s boss said: “We are not ignoring the broader challenges on the UK high street and, during the second half, we conducted a business review to ensure our High Street business is fit for purpose now and for the future.”Earlier this year, WH Smith was voted the worst shop on the high street in a survey carried out by Which?, with shoppers criticising customer service, value for money and the standard of its stores.Shares in the group dropped more than 7 per cent in early trading.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As well as the two phones – the smaller and bigger version – there was\u0026nbspa new version of the Google Home voice assistant that has a screen, as well as a\u0026nbspnew tablet.Most of the new devices had already been leaked ahead of the official unveiling, but Google still managed a few surprises, especially with its exceptional camera.A full round-up of the event can be found below.As we wait for everything to get started, perhaps it\u0027s worth taking a trip down memory lane to where it all began: the original Pixel. I reviewed it in glowing terms all the way back in 2016, and I think the phone has kept up the promises it showed at that time.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s that original review.With the launch of Indy Minds, we\u0027re offering editors\u0027 letters, which offer a little peek behind the scenes here. And I\u0027ve written today\u0027s, which covers the Google launch as well as our preparations and thoughts. You can take a look at here if you like.Google has lots going on today, not all of it quite as fun or as exciting as the Pixel. For instance, it just disclosed there was a major hack of Google+, and that it\u0027s shutting down.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s why that\u0027s important, even if you don\u0027t consider yourself a Google+ user (which, well, who among us does).We\u0027re starting off with a bit of an unusual video about all of the leaks there have been relating to the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. And there have been a lot.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe soundtrack\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsp\u0027Help\u0027 by The Beatles – a hint for things to come perhaps? Google Assistant anyone?Rick Osterloh comes on stage to tell us that 2018 marks the 20th anniversary of Google. It\u0027s fair to say the company has achieved a lot in that time, but Osterloh doesn\u0027t have time to tell us about all of that. He\u0027s here to talk about the Pixel.\u0026nbspMany of you in this room say last year\u0027s Pixel 2 still takes the best photos even after a year with so many amazing phones, he says, before moving on to the AI technology that makes this possible.From out of a pedestal in the middle of the room, appear three devices: The Pixel 3, Pixel Slate and Google Home Hub.\u0026nbspEager reporters are crowding around to get a picture, as Osterloh races through the announcements.\u0026nbspThe Pixel Slate apparently brings the power and productivity of a desktop to a tablet, according to Osterloh. Google definitely isn\u0027t the first to make that claim.\u0026nbspThe Google Home Hub, as you might imagine, is for the home. The smart home in 2018 is too complex, he says. I dunno if a brand new device is the way to make things any clearer.Diya Jolly, Google\u0027s vice president of product management, comes on stage to talk about the smart home, revealing that queries to Google Home has gone up 400 per cent in the past year.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNow imagine not just hearing\u0026nbspa response, but being able to\u0026nbspsee\u0026nbspa response. That is the power of Google Home Hub, she says, referencing the screen that accompanies the hub, as she refers to it.It\u0027s a bit like the Portal device that Facebook unveiled this week, however there is one key difference.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWe\u0026nbspconsciously did not put a camera on the Hub so that is comfortable to use in private spaces like the bedroom, she says.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s\u0026nbsplots\u0026nbspof digital wellbeing here. It\u0027s been a major part of every announcement. The Hub, for instance, can be put into a special downtime mode so that it won\u0027t bother you the Slate will start to go to sleep at night time. Like Anthony said about the Hub\u0027s lack of cameras, it\u0027s hard to read Google and Apple\u0027s focus on this stuff as anything but a shot at people like Facebook, even if they aren\u0027t doing it consciously.Please allow a moment for the live blog to loadShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

By Patrick KingsleyClick to followThe IndependentAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, the number of children receiving at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled in the last yearIt’s half past eight, and the school day is just starting at Morecambe Bay Primary, a state-run\u0026nbspschool in northwest England. Siobhan Collingwood, the headteacher, points\u0026nbspto a cheerful boy munching his way through two slices of toast – his first meal of the day.Teachers, she says, sometimes find him sifting through trash cans for discarded fruit. “He’d eat his way through whatever we put in front of him.”Some students trickle\u0026nbspthrough without stopping they’ve\u0026nbspalready eaten. But a few dozen head\u0026nbspstraight to the food counter. Of 350 students, roughly one in three would not have breakfast unless the school provided it, Collingwood reckons.Brexit wasn’t caused by austerity, and here’s the proofDuring Collingwood’s 13 years as headteacher at Morecambe Bay Primary, there have\u0026nbspalways been a few hungry children. But two years ago, the staff noticed an increasing number of youngsters returning undernourished after spending school breaks at home.Initially, Collingwood and her staff were puzzled.\u0026nbspMany parents held jobs, even if they struggled to cover the bills. Then it dawned on them that the rising number of hungry children at Morecambe Bay coincided with sharp reductions in welfare benefits associated with the clumsy introduction of a new welfare programme.“As we spoke to parents,” Collingwood says, “it became clear that for many of them, it was caused by changes to the benefit system rolled out in recent years, which were forcing families into crisis.”Across Britain, the number of children living in poverty has jumped sharply in the past six years, a trend that critics blame in part on the\u0026nbspgovernment’s policy of austerity, the budget-slashing response to the 2008 financial crisis\u0026nbspsteadily reshaping British life.And there is no immediate relief on the horizon. The County Councils Network, a group of local governing bodies, warned recently of £1bn\u0026nbspin budget cuts nationwide next year, draining more money from social services, including some for children.To be clear, Britain is not Venezuela. Reports of hungry children showing up in Morecambe doctors’ offices with rickets have proved false. But that is cold comfort in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one that over the years has made a strong commitment to child welfare.While hunger is not the only social pathology associated with childhood poverty, it is perhaps the hardest to conceal. In that respect, it is a flashing signal of a deepening problem.For children, the consequences of poverty can be severe. In the short term, poverty elevates the risk of illness, hunger and social stigma. In the long term, it can create a vicious cycle from which a child struggles to escape, especially in class-conscious Britain.British teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are roughly a third as likely to achieve good GCSE\u0026nbspgrades, according to government statistics.They are then roughly half as likely to go to university, according to a separate set of government data. Those who do make it are less likely to get a better paid job within six months of graduation than those from more privileged backgrounds. And they are less likely to make it into high status professions, such as finance, law or medicine.Even those who do crack the “class ceiling” earn an average of 16 per cent less than more privileged peers, researchers at the London School of Economics found.The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the pastAnd those from poorer backgrounds are likely to die around five years earlier than those who are not, government data suggests.Before the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent budget squeeze, successive British governments, both Conservative and Labour, achieved progress on childhood poverty. The number of minors living in “relative poverty” – families with an annual household income less than 60 per cent of the national median, after housing costs – fell by roughly 800,000\u0026nbspto 3.5 million\u0026nbspbetween 1998 and 2012, or 27 per cent of all Britons aged 16 or younger.But the same year that parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act, a central plank of the austerity programme, the trend began to reverse.\u0026nbspSince 2012, about 600,000 children have fallen back into “relative poverty”. During the same period, the number of children requiring food handouts from the Trussell Trust, the country’s largest network of food banks, more than tripled, to over 484,000 from nearly 127,000.Overall, since returning to power in 2010, the Conservatives have announced more than £30bn\u0026nbspin benefit cuts and abandoned prior targets to substantially reduce child poverty by 2020.By 2021, roughly 35 per cent of all minors in Britain are predicted to be poor, according to forecasts by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And the country’s pending departure from the European Union may deepen the problem, because of rising living costs and the sudden loss of funding from Brussels for young people, according to a joint assessment by seven leading children’s charities.In November, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty\u0026nbspPhilip Alston will make an official visit to Britain to research the connection between the austerity programme and the rise in poverty – the first such visit to Britain by a United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty.“It’s increasingly evident, particularly to people working with children, that we’re in a child poverty crisis,” says Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, a British charity. “And it is primarily to do with the massive cuts to benefits.”The Conservative Party leaders who pushed through the austerity programme\u0026nbspdispute that it is the cause of rising child poverty, or that child poverty is increasing. They argue that universal credit – the\u0026nbspnew system that bundles most payments into one –\u0026nbspis an improvement.The new system is “infinitely better than what it replaced”, says Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister who oversaw the changes. “The process of stepping into work is easier.”That rationale is being questioned. Though unemployment has been more than halved under the Conservatives, the overall child poverty rate has risen. And roughly two-thirds of poor children have at least one parent who works, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.“We tell ourselves completely the wrong story about poverty in the UK,” Garnham says. “The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the past.”Created with Sketch.Greeks slide deeper into poverty Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Working, but poorJust outside Morecambe, a tourist town that no longer draws so many tourists, George McCullough, a single parent to a six-year-old son, is\u0026nbspin financial meltdown. His rent has\u0026nbspfallen into arrears, and he can\u0026nbspno longer pay the family’s utility bills. He’s started\u0026nbspto dip into his overdraft, incurring further bank charges.He’s\u0026nbspstopped socialising and sometimes skips\u0026nbspmeals to ensure that his son eats\u0026nbspthree times a day. But he can\u0026nbspno longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.“He basically can’t go to any of his mates’ parties or houses,” McCullough says. “I literally can’t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.”What\u0026nbspthrew\u0026nbsphis affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, McCullough received around £685\u0026nbspevery month to supplement the roughly £500\u0026nbspa month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.It’s\u0026nbspnot just that he now receives\u0026nbsproughly £40\u0026nbspless a month, though for a family that was already struggling to stay above the poverty line, the cut – the cost of a week’s groceries – was painful. (Others have experienced worse: the average working family has lost more than £75\u0026nbspa month, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group.)What has really hurt McCullough\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphow that loss is\u0026nbspcompounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment –\u0026nbspa dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In McCullough’s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre“If this is going to be a regular occurrence,” McCullough asked, “where is the incentive to work?”McCullough’s experiences are not unique. The government’s own research into the system found that nearly half of claimants needed help to fill out the application form, while four in 10 were still facing financial difficulties eight months into their time on universal credit.Duncan Smith, who was the secretary of state for work and pensions between 2010 and 2015, acknowledges\u0026nbspproblems with the way the system has been put into effect.\u0026nbspHe even resigned in 2015 because the finance minister at the time, George Osborne, cut an additional £4bn\u0026nbspfrom the welfare budget. “I thought that was too much,” Duncan Smith says.But “the system itself is the right system,” he adds. “Though a large number of working families are still in poverty, they were in deeper poverty when they were out of work. As they move into work, they’re better off.”Back at McCullough’s, the father’s eyes well\u0026nbspup as his phone buzzes\u0026nbspwith debt notices from the local water board, and he describes\u0026nbsphow he struggles\u0026nbspto provide his son with some of the basic things in life – like fresh vegetables, new clothes and haircuts.McCullough voted Conservative in past elections and says he would do so again if an election were held tomorrow. Despite his travails, he supports the party’s cautious approach to state spending, and he thinks there are too many people expecting handouts for nothing.But he no longer believes that restructuring benefits will get more people into work, or more children out of poverty.“Until you walk a mile in someone’s shoes, you can’t know,” McCullough says. “Until you’ve seen how it works, you don’t understand.”In Morecambe, the area’s Conservative MP\u0026nbspDavid Morris\u0026nbspsays in an email that child poverty had fallen in his constituency, and blames\u0026nbsp“left-wing political activists” for any suggestion to the contrary. In previous interviews, he has accused headteacher Collingwood of having political motivations for speaking out.But the demand for free breakfasts at Morecambe Bay Primary is not the only warning sign.The relative child poverty rate in Morris’s constituency rose to 25.9 per cent from 2013 to 2017, up from 24.2 per cent, according to research by the Centre\u0026nbspfor Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. That may not sound like much, but the rise has produced marked changes on the ground.How social supermarkets are filling a gap in austerity BritainAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, for instance, the number of children who received at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled to 1,229 in 2017-18, from 656 in 2013-14. At the local branch of Citizens Advice the number of food vouchers distributed to children in the same period increased sixfold, to 1,336 from 222.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre, where social workers would work with children and parents to solve their problems.Since 2010, however, roughly 1,000 of these centres have been closed across Britain after about £990m\u0026nbspin funding cuts. Those that remain – such as those in the Morecambe area – have substantially reduced their capacity.“The caseload is growing, and the system\u0026nbspby which we would have supported them is diminishing,” Collingwood says. “We feel much more like an island.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That is certainly the case where me and Rupert Murdoch are concerned.I was a young, new journalist on The Sunday Times. I’d been charged with “gutting” an official report into a business deal – the buyer was thought to have covered up the source\u0026nbspof his money. It was a big story at the time. I was called to the editor’s office\u0026nbspand told, to my shock, that I was not only going to cover the findings, but I was writing that week’s leader.Just at that point, as the news sank in, the editor suddenly rose. Behind me, a familiar figure had walked, unannounced, into the room. It was Murdoch, the proprietor. He gestured to sit down, and asked what we were discussing.Rupert Murdoch may be revitalised by his exit from SkyThe editor told him, and explained that it was going to be the subject of an editorial\u0026nbspand that I was putting it together. Whereupon Murdoch turned to me, fixed me with a stare, and asked: “Why does it matter?”I stammered some sort of reply about the importance of knowing where people’s funding originated – this was well before money laundering became a hot topic. Murdoch wrinkled his face. I was on shaky ground, clearly he did not think it of any importance at all. Then, another man who was standing in the doorway, who was accompanying him, spoke. He reminded Murdoch that they’d done a deal with the subject of the official inquiry, which had gone sour. Murdoch listened, and nodded. “That’s right, I remember.” He looked at me. “Son, write it as hard as you like.”Down the years, the memory of that short encounter has stuck. Murdoch was not physically large, but he conveyed immense power. His energy was obvious. He was naturally combative, constantly seeking to challenge.Back then, the basement under The Sunday Times building in\u0026nbspWapping was a store room. It was full of satellite dishes. Sky TV was in its infancy, and it relied on the newfangled device of a dish rather than the traditional aerial. If I’m honest, I doubt if many of us gave the fledgling venture much of a chance. Terrestrial broadcasting, led by the BBC, was so entrenched in the UK, that the prospect of it being seriously taken on seemed fanciful. Not only that, Sky would have to rely on a pay-per-view model, while the BBC was funded by the government, and by what was effectively a tax in the form of the annual licence fee.The amount the Murdoch family is said to have made from selling their 39 per cent stake in Sky to ComcastSome 30 years later, Murdoch has sold his remaining 39 per cent stake in Sky to the US company Comcast, in a deal that valued the UK firm at £30bn, and which netted the founder and his family £12bn.The company statement which accompanied the deal showed I was not alone in my scepticism. “When we launched Sky in 1989 it was four channels produced from a prefab structure in an industrial park on the fringes of west London,” it said. “We bet – and almost lost –\u0026nbspthe farm on launching a business that many didn’t think was such a good idea. Today, Sky is Europe’s leading entertainment company and a world-class example of a customer-driven enterprise.”While that hints at the risk Murdoch took –\u0026nbspand gives some indication of his resulting emotional attachment to the company, and pride in his achievement\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspit does not say what Sky also did: transforming English football rivalling the mighty BBC for news coverage with Sky News and taking on broadband providers by offering internet services. And as it says, the company spread across Europe, in Italy and Germany. In the process, Sky also grew to become a central component in the Murdoch global empire.Rupert Murdoch may be revitalised by his exit from SkyComcast beats Rupert Murdoch’s Fox in Sky takeover battleMPs vow to defy ‘threatening’ newspaper headlines on Brexit voteTony Blair: closeness to the Murdoch press was a ‘necessary evil’Now, it’s gone. Not only that, Murdoch has previously sold much of 21st Century Fox’s film and TV production assets to Disney in a $70bn (£54bn) deal, leaving him and his family with the Fox sports and news channels, and the News Corp newspaper and publishing businesses in the UK, US and Australia.That’s still a massive undertaking, and one that would keep most people fully engaged. But Murdoch is not most people. Even at 87 years of age he exhibits the ambition and drive of someone much younger.There have been signs in recent years of Murdoch slowing down. But it would be wrong to suppose these latest developments\u0026nbspwill see him signal the end. When he gave evidence to the House of Commons select committee on phone hacking by his newspapers in 2012\u0026nbspthe slowness of his answers, containing numerous pauses, shocked many.Not those who know Murdoch. He’s always spoken like this, particularly in a situation where he is being confronted and put on the spot. His tactic is to buy time, to speak after a considered silence, to be drawn out, and careful.He is extremely happily ensconced\u0026nbspwith his new wife, Jerry Hall, 25 years his junior. At a recent party, attended by media and arts folk, their arrival drew the usual sarcastic whispers, along the lines of what does the tall, former supermodel see in the much older billionaire. My wife, who was observing, said it was obvious – they were very much in love, you only had to look at their body language, and their attentiveness towards each other, to realise that.She had a point: they did indeed appear infatuated, moving away from the crowd to sit,\u0026nbspchat and laugh together.These days, Murdoch is more likely to be found in suburban Richmond, in southwest London, where Jerry has long maintained a glorious home, than in one of the world’s business centres. Early mornings often find him taking a constitutional walk in nearby Richmond Park. But that does not mean the friendly old cove – several journalists have declared their astonishment at seeing the feared media titan strolling along, smiling and relaxed – is not pondering as he goes.It’s too easy to suppose the phrase “clogs to clogs in three generations” applies to Rupert and his offspring. On the face of it that might appear so – he spends three decades building up Sky, longer where his newspapers are concerned\u0026nbsphis progeny are not up to the task of grabbing the steering wheel and pushing the businesses on to even greater heights.It’s true that they might lack their father’s hunger and clarity of vision. It’s impossible for instance to imagine James, Lachlan or Elisabeth (Prudence, their elder half-sister, is not so business-oriented) having the courage to buy a fading paper like The Sun, and to turn it into the self-styled “People’s Paper”, challenging the orthodoxy every inch of the way. Or being prepared to tilt at BBC News. Or\u0026nbspdisrupting the established order by forcing up the price of live sports rights.Neither, though, are any of the three exactly business schmucks. Each has proved themselves to be successful, capable of guiding and leading. They are however very different characters, with specific interests and qualities. Broadly, James is into distribution and technology, Lachlan loves news, Elisabeth is adept at developing new TV content. Ideally, possibly, Murdoch might have hoped for one of them to emerge as a Rupert Mk2, but that has not materialised.According to Murdoch’s biographer, Michael Wolff, he was desperate for his children to take over –\u0026nbsp“taking pride of place even over profits.”It was not to be.The fact is that with the sales, Murdoch has seen the threat posed by the digital juggernauts, realised he was embedded predominantly in legacy media, as it’s somewhat disparagingly referred to by the onliners, decided it was going to be tough\u0026nbsp(and get even tougher)\u0026nbspto compete – so stayed in the game, but readied to sell up if the price was right.Murdoch’s passion is in power, in the nexus of politics and business – and that is in newsThat moment has been reached, but while it must rankle that his interests have shrunk, he can take satisfaction from the realisation that the price paid is far higher than anyone foresaw. He may be emotionally attached, but price will always win out. Indeed, he can allow himself a wry smile that Comcast may turn out to have overpaid.Meanwhile, the pressure of combatting the tech behemoths is off, and all he has to do is count his winnings. Murdoch’s situation is akin to that of a poker player getting out while on top. Yes, he may have gone on to chalk up yet more brilliant hands, but equally he may not have been dealt any more. Better, surely, to duck out now, and leave the agony of battle, and watch how the cards fall to the other players in future.There were opponents –\u0026nbspJames, in particular, is believed to have been resistant (as he should have been, since it was James’s part of the Murdoch business mass that was being offloaded).In the end, says Wolff:\u0026nbsp“It is Hall who is said to have given voice to the obvious: just sell and be done.”But it’s not as if the Murdochs are quitting completely. Not only do they retain Fox News and their other sports channels and Fox assets\u0026nbsp(now repackaged in New Fox, to be run by Lachlan), but they have some of the world’s leading print titles with their attendant websites, to be going on with. And bags of cash.They’re now able to pick and choose what they want to buy, where they want to go. One assumption is that they will bolster New Fox’s presence in sports by purchasing more live TV rights. Another is that they will seek to get back into content creation by making their own programmes for the Fox TV networks. Already, names like Sony Pictures Entertainment and Lionsgate are being mentioned as possible acquisition targets. Or, New Fox might decide to start from scratch and develop its own version of Netflix.Tony Blair: closeness to the Murdoch press was a ‘necessary evil’Lachlan takes the tiller at New Fox, answerable to his father. James is going off to pursue other interests – he is a director of Tesla, and a close friend of Matthew Vaughn, the film producer and director, and the possibility of James and Matthew hooking up in business together has been rumoured.Of course, it won’t be the same, but consider: New Fox alone should generate more than $2bn a year in cash, and that’s without dipping into the proceeds from the sales of Fox’s entertainment and production arms, and Sky. Murdoch and the younger Murdochs, in short, are not leaving the global media stage. Not yet.It may just be that the sell-offs allow Murdoch to return to his first love: newspapers. He was never that much interested in producing entertainment shows and films. His passion is in power, in the nexus of politics and business – and that is\u0026nbspin news. And that means Fox, but it also means newspapers, where he began, in Australia, all those years ago.In Australia, his newspapers played a pivotal role in the\u0026nbsprecent putsch against the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, criticising his energy policy. In the UK, his company has moved into news and current affairs radio, adding Talk Radio. Meanwhile, his News UK newspapers continue to enjoy prominence and influence, setting the agenda for TV and radio newscasts.Gove and Rupert Murdoch’s relationship should be investigated, says Private Eye editor Ian HislopIn the US, Murdoch finds himself in a curious position. He’s not thought to have much regard for Donald Trump, although he is close to Ivanka, Trump’s daughter, and her husband, Jared Kushner.Trump, though, is a Republican, and a maverick, someone who likes to shake up the established way. In that sense, he is just like the head of the Fox channel –\u0026nbspTrump’s favourite and, in turn, a strident supporter of the president –\u0026nbspand the newspapers, The Wall Street Journal and New York Post.Murdoch may have little time for Trump. For all his directness, and for all the cheekiness of some of his titles, notably The Sun, Murdoch remains a serious man at heart, reserving his favour for conviction politicians. But even if Trump does not qualify for praise\u0026nbspin Murdoch’s eyes,\u0026nbspthe media chief still remains a hugely vital figure, right at the centre of the daily cut and thrust surrounding the president.There is much, then, for Murdoch to relish. A chapter or two has been brought to a close, but the story of Murdoch and the Murdochs is far from over.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns and strategic communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

disarray’\u0026nbspas British project leaders have their positions handed to European partnersClick to followThe IndependentProfessor Peter Coveney is concerned about the fate of medical research in the country following BrexitA top British scientist has called the government “totally chaotic” as he stands to lose\u0026nbsphis leadership of major European projects after Brexit.\u0026nbspProfessor Peter Coveney heads up three EU projects with a total value of around £15m, and he says work like his will be compromised if a deal is not agreed before March.His research, which aims to create a “forecasting system” that predicts disease, involves scientists working across Europe but is led from University College London.A no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK science communityWhile the government said\u0026nbspit will fund British scientists participating in European projects if they lose out on money post-Brexit, it has not promised to support entire projects with UK scientists at the helm.The EU currently hands British project leaders millions of euros to distribute among their partners, but it will not do this if the UK is relegated to a so-called “third country” after Brexit.“The big thing that is unclear is that there is no agreement from the government here to continue to support projects that are led by the UK,” said Professor Coveney.“So leadership of projects – big ones that are influential – is thrown completely into disarray.”Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with

simulate human bodies and plan people’s medical treatments and surgeries in advance.Due to limited British capacity to undertake such projects, he said this kind of research is totally dependent on European collaboration.His criticism comes after Royal Society president Venki Ramakrishnan\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspTV particle physicist Professor Brian Cox voiced their concerns about the impact of Brexit – particularly a no-deal outcome – on British science.Many leading scientists, including two Nobel prize winners, have backed The Independent‘s campaign for a Final Say on the Brexit vote.Leading scientists back call for Brexit deal voteThe UK is currently positioned as a European leader, home to many of the EU’s most prestigious research institutions and receiving 15 per cent of the funding from the flagship European funding programme Horizon 2020.However, this status will be threatened if the nation’s top scientists are forced to hand over the reins of their research to partners.Such an outcome now seems likely, as the government expects the UK to become a third country without a deal, and the prospect of a no-deal Brexit now looks more plausible than ever before.He wants reassurances that his projects and the livelihoods of lab members who are paid with this funding are not jeopardised.Professor Coveney contacted Mr Gyimah to voice his concerns, and received an assurance that the government was “seeking discussion” with the European Commission concerning a no-deal scenario.“This would need to include projects where the UK participant is responsible for coordinating funding,” Mr Gyimah wrote.Scientists fear loss of half a billion pounds of funding after no-dealDismissing this response as “merely regurgitating” information from the government’s official no-deal planning documents “that was unhelpful in the first place”, Professor Coveney said he needs the government to guarantee it will replace any lost funding in its entirety. He has laid out his case in a blog post for the campaign group Scientists for EU.“The picture is as follows: if you were to be a third country following midnight on 29\u0026nbspMarch and you wanted to continue to run these big projects, it would be incumbent on you to fund the entire thing,” he said.This would mean committing to funding not only the British scientist in charge of the project, but also the international team working with them.Despite the expense, he said this was a price worth paying to maintain UK leadership in science and protect the health of its citizens by funding medical research.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They are blasts of incredible energy – equivalent to the amount released by the Sun in 80 years – that last for just a moment, and come from a mysterious source.Created with Sketch.SpaceX\u0027s journey through the Solar System  Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Some have suggested they are being emitted by an extraterrestrial intelligence. Harvard University scientists suggested last year that they could be leaks from vast transmitters that are usually shooting at light sail ships to push them across the universe.Others have suggested that less intelligent but equally spectacular causes, such as black holes or dense stars smashing into each other.Now scientists have far more examples to study as they attempt to find where the blasts are coming from.“We’ve found 20 fast radio bursts in a year, almost doubling the number detected worldwide since they were discovered in 2007,” said lead author Dr Ryan Shannon, from Swinburne University of Technology and the OzGrav ARC Centre of Excellence.“Using the new technology of the Australia Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), we’ve also proved that fast radio bursts are coming from the other side of the Universe rather than from our own galactic neighbourhood.”Man being blasted into space by Elon Musk says he \u0027trusts\u0027 himThe new stars have helped scientists track the bursts as they make their way through the universe. They have travelled for billions of years, occasionally passing through clouds of gas as they go, and scientists can use that fact to work out that they are coming from roughly halfway across the universe.“Each time this happens, the different wavelengths that make up a burst are slowed by different amounts,” he said.“Eventually, the burst reaches Earth with its spread of wavelengths arriving at the telescope at slightly different times, like swimmers at a finish line.“Timing the arrival of the different wavelengths tells us how much material the burst has travelled through on its journey.“And because we’ve shown that fast radio bursts come from far away, we can use them to detect all the missing matter located in the space between galaxies--which is a really exciting discovery.”KAT-7 Array pointing skyward at the proposed South African site for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope near Carnavon in the country\u0027s remote Northern Cape province in this picture taken May 18, 2012 (Reuters)The vast number of new bursts discovered is a consequence of the fact that scientists were using new equipment on those telescopes, which allow\u0026nbspthem to have a vast field of view across the sky.Now they hope they can discover more and pinpoint their source in the sky even more precisely. If they do, they might be able to tie them to one particular galaxy, and in so doing understand more about where they come from.They also hope to be able to detect even more of them. If enough can be seen, they could become a useful way of understanding the early universe, since the blasts were sent when it was far younger than it is today.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

According to our estimates, that could suppress wage growth by over 0.25 percentage points each year,” he said.The remarks come at the end of the worst decade for inflation-adjusted average pay in almost 200 years (described by Mr Haldane\u0026nbspas a “lost decade”) and when the Labour Party is pledging to give trade unions a major boost in order to “restore the balance of power in the workplace”.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told Labour’s conference last month that a future Labour government would extend union rights to part-time and temporary workers. He has also said he will roll out “sectoral collective bargaining” across the economy.Mr Haldane, in his speech at an ACAS conference in London, also echoed another Labour critique of the modern workplace, by suggesting that the rise of insecure work and zero hours contracts was holding back pay by acting as a disincentive for people to move jobs (or “twist”), something that has been traditionally associated with a pay rise.“One of the side-effects of structurally-higher job insecurity is a reduced willingness to add to that uncertainty by moving job,” he said.“If so, this would mean ‘twisters’\u0026nbspare fewer in number than in the past and that stickers are at an even greater pay disadvantage to twisters as their outside option has lost value. In short, job insecurity reduces workers’ pay power and weakens upward pressure on pay.”Mr Haldane\u0026nbspidentified other factors that have dragged on UK pay growth in recent years, including the growing market power of large firms and automation.However, he struck a more optimistic note about the immediate prospect for pay growth saying that we may be witnessing a “new dawn” for pay growth due to the exhaustion of slack in the economy, something that should compel employers to lift pay awards.According to the Office for National Statistics nominal annual average pay growth, excluding bonuses, was running at 2.9 per cent in July, still well below pre-financial crisis growth rates.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

On top of this, government’s own research shows that sanctioning under universal credit has no effect in encouraging people to progress in work.\u0026nbsp“With the next stage of universal\u0026nbspcredit about to rollout to three million people, it is vital that we learn from evidence on the ground and avoid the mistakes of the past.”\u0026nbspMargaret Greenwood, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, said it was “shocking” that the government was sanctioning working people who are “just trying to do the right thing”.She said: “This report shows that there is no evidence that sanctioning helps people increase their earnings. Meanwhile, wages are still below 2008 levels and millions of people are stuck in insecure work.“Universal credit is clearly failing in its current form. Labour is committed to a root-and-branch review of the social security system to ensure it tackles poverty and provides support when people need it.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Scotland\u0027s First Minister and leader of the Scottish National Party, Nicola Sturgeon acknowledges the applause as she delivers her keynote speech to delegates on the final day of the SNP annual conference in Glasgow Anna Richardson and Alastair Campbell pose with their portraits at Let\u0027s Talk, a photography exhibition created in partnership with Mental Health UK at Regent\u0027s Place in London.

He said such checks “already exist in many EU member states – such as between mainland Spain and the Canary islands”.The negotiator also said the EU believed regulatory compliance checks for industrial goods could be carried out at the premises of businesses.But Mr Barnier warned that so-called phytosanitary checks on live animals and other agricultural products had to be carried out at the border, and would have to apply to 100 per cent of all imports. Some of these checks already exist, but they are only conducted as spot-checks and applied to just 10 per cent of imports.“EU rules are very clear: such checks must happen at the border because of food safety and animal health reasons,” he told business leaders.EU rules are very clear: such checks must happen at the border because of food safety and animal health reasons“Obviously in the future the island of Ireland will remain and must remain a simple epidemiologic area, obviously.\u0026nbsp“Such checks already exist in the port of Larne and Belfast. However they would have to cover 100 per cent rather than 10 per cent of live animals and animal-derived products, which would involve a significant change in terms of scale.”He added that there would have to be “administrative procedures that do not exist today” but that “the EU proposes to carry out these checks in the least intrusive way possible”.“The UK wants to leave and will leave the single market and customs union. This means that there must be checks on goods travelling between the EU and the UK and checks that do not exist today,” he warned.Business cannot plan for Brexit \u0027because of government secrecy\u0027Government recruits emergency staff to help tackle Brexit \u0027disruption\u0027Brexit paves way for Scottish independence, Sturgeon saysDUP leader Arlene Foster meets EU officials for extensive Brexit talksMr Barnier said such checks could be reduced in scope in the future if the UK and EU signed a veterinary agreement down the line as part of a trade deal.Brussels is currently in an information lockdown for the final stages of talks, with officials tighter-lipped than usual about progress coming towards a solution.\u0026nbspThe British government has indicated that it would accept regulatory checks proposed by Mr Barnier and that it does not see them as a breach of the UK’s sovereignty in the same way as it sees customs checks.\u0026nbspBut the DUP has made clear that it does not see things the same way,\u0026nbspmeaning a deal could be agreed between the government and EU and then voted down by Ms May’s allies in the Commons.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Pre-tax profit dropped 4 per cent to £134m from £140m although trading profit was up 3 per cent to £163m from £158m last year. Group revenue was flat on a like-for-like basis. Stephen Clarke, WH Smith’s chief executive, said the group had a good year on the high street, “despite the well documented challenges of the UK high street”. The second half of the year was particularly encouraging, Mr Clarke, as “the business traded well and we quickly identified the latest trend in the market, becoming a one-stop-shop for all slime related products”.What is slime and is it dangerous?The new craze seeing parents inadvertently burn their childrenWH Smith slammed for selling toothpaste at £8 a tube in hospitalWH Smith shows how to be a high street survivorSlime products have surged in popularity in the last 12 months, becoming a must-have plaything for children, although some consumer groups have warned of safety risks. \u0026nbspDespite the boost to business from slime, WH Smith’s boss said: “We are not ignoring the broader challenges on the UK high street and, during the second half, we conducted a business review to ensure our High Street business is fit for purpose now and for the future.”Earlier this year, WH Smith was voted the worst shop on the high street in a survey carried out by Which?, with shoppers criticising customer service, value for money and the standard of its stores.Shares in the group dropped more than 7 per cent in early trading.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Tony Blair warns Brexit pain will go on for \u0026lsquoLONG TIME\u0026rsquo                 Thirty Conservative MPs gang together to DEMAND another Brexit voteProfessor Sked told RT: \u0026ldquoThe trouble is the five percent still to be sorted is the very important bit.\u0026ldquoI mean, they can\u0026rsquot agree on tariffs, if May were to try to keep us in the single market or the customs union, that would be against everything she has said so far, it would break her own red lines and I presume about seven cabinet ministers would resign. Northern Ireland is still impossible to fix.When asked whether Theresa May still had time to alter her Chequers proposal, Mr Sked claimed the Prime Minister was going to come under \u0026ldquohuge pressure from within her own cabinet.He added: \u0026ldquoThey will say, \u0026lsquolook Chequers really is dead, you can\u0026rsquot go on talking about it as if it is alive\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoThe plan B that everybody seems to be wanting is the Canada-plus free trade agreement.\u0026ldquoShe has been saying quite adamantly recently that it doesn\u0026rsquot work, she doesn\u0026rsquot believe in it. It doesn\u0026rsquot solve the Northern Ireland problem.\u0026ldquoNow, if she doesn\u0026rsquot accept the Canada-deal, she could go for the Norway-model, but that would mean keeping us in the single market.\u0026ldquoIf she doesn\u0026rsquot want to do any of these and she is told that Chequers really is dead by Brussels, then it becomes more and more like no deal.Mr Sked added: \u0026ldquoNo deal is still perfectly possible, we are running out of time.Brexit news: Alan Sked no deal is rapidly becoming May\u0027s only option (Image: \u0026bullRT)Mrs May has repeatedly said the two remaining Brexit options for the UK are either Chequers or no deal.Speaking on the Today programme on Monday Mr Baker warned Mrs May about the about of Tory MPs who would vote down Chequers.He said: \u0026ldquoI did a concrete canvas of colleagues when it was amendments to legislation and came up with the number nearly 80.\u0026ldquoOf course, the Government are going to whip this vote extremely hard but what I would say is, whips would be doing incredibly well if they were to halve the numbers.\u0026ldquoMy estimate is that there are at least 40 colleagues who are not going to accept a half-in, half-out Chequers deal. Or indeed a backstop that leaves us in the internal market and customs union come what may.

Driving me mad!”Berwyn Evans, of Rentokil, said: “The unusually hot summer created perfect conditions for ladybirds to thrive.They seek buildings in large numbers to hibernate in over colder months.”Brits have taken to social media to share footage of the Harlequin iety of ladybirds swarm around doors and windows.Professor Helen Roy at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, who organises the UK Ladybird Survey, told BBC: Its quite a wildle spectacle to see.She said that the reports had first started in the north of England as the weather started to turn.It comes after the Met Office last month confirmed the sky-high average temperatures of .C from June to August had made the summer a record-breaking scorcher.Experts said it was most likely the ladybirds spotted around homes were the invasive Harlequin.Reports of the red and black beetles have spread across the UK, with one woman in London writing: Attack of the Ladybirds update: its officially out of hand, I’ve lost control of the room.Pest controllers have said the Harlequin ladybirds are not harmful to humans eventhey do bite you.They can be a nuisance in your home as they usually dwell in clusters and can give off a strong-smelling, staining yellow liquid.But they can be hard to remove from your home.One option is to trying vacuuming them up, this is best to do when they appear to be sleeping as this gives you a better chance of catching them before they fly away andthey disperse then they will form a cluster in a new area and then risk staining another part of your home.It may be dficult to seal up any entrances are the insects are small but blocking up as many as possible may reduce the number getting in.You can hopefully clean up the yellow stains by wiping the surfaces with white vinegar.Another added they had the same problem in Warwick, West Midlands, saying: Warwick seems to be being taken over by ladybirds. They are everywhere!!A third also reported: Hundreds of #adybirds crawling all over the greenstone walls in Shaftesbury today.Harlequin ladybirds, scientic name Harmonia axyridis, are ladybirds that are not native to Britain.Experts have previously said the ladybirds reach Britain by hitching a lt on the warm southerly winds.The foreign creepy-crawlies are said to pose a threat to the domestic species because they carry a sexually-transmitted disease, called Laboulbeniales fungal disease.They are sometimes called the “Halloween ladybird” in the US because of the time of the year they flock.But there are actually , dferent species of ladybirds across the globe, with  dfernet types in the UK.The Harlequin ladybird is one of the newest insects to the block, appearing in Britain in .The beetles were introduced into mainland Europe from Asia, with it hoped they would help to control plant pests.Thriving here, they have even outcompeted some native ladybird species - even known to eat other ladybird larvae.To recognise the Harlequin ladybird from other British species, there are some telltale signs including:- Harlequin ladybirds are generally large, measuring about -mm- Their wing colour can be pale yellow-orange, orange-red, red or black highly iable- The pattern on their backs generally have zero to  orange-red or black spots* According to the Harlequin Ladybird SurveyThe deluge normally comes around this time of year, with a woman filming the insects pelting her countryside home as they sought shelter.Margaret, who lives just outside of Ickleton, Cambridgeshire, said the three-day pelting was like something out of Hitchcocks The Birds.Margaret said: I was lucky I noticed it was happening as they just came out of nowhere and started hitting the window and streaming in.It was a struggle to close the window as I didnt want to squash any of them and by then they were already all over the window frame.Its not the first time the loveliness of ladybirds have swarmed homes.Residents in the town of Lipova, in western Romania, were forced to seal up their homes after the beetles descended in .Locals said they were so many it was like a living carpet, and that they had to shovel them out."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000433197202.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jean claude juncker everything wrong with eu","story":"He is everything that’s wrong with the European project — and why it’s so vital that we leave.In his latest rant, he demanded “respect” and delivered a warning that “Press freedom has its limits”.

But this is the reality of trying to save up for a house.They work hard each month. They’d love to put something aside to save up for a home.But to live where there are good jobs, they have to spend so much on high rents that there’s nothing left over.So they can never save enough to break out of the cycle. No wonder they are frustrated.New figures show how bad things have got. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says four out of ten people in the  to -year-old age bracket couldn’t afford the mortgage on even the cheapest house in their area, eventhey had a deposit.The gap between prices and normal people’s earnings is just too big, because since  house prices in Britain have gone up more than in any other developed country.Expensive housing has meant that the proportion of young people on middle incomes who own their own home has collapsed: down from nearly two thirds  years ago, to just over a quarter today.We have to turn this round and restore home ownership.Many people feel they can’t get on and start a family until they have a nest of their own. Their lives are on hold.Politically it’s vital too. If young people don’t feel they’ve got a chance to get on in le, they are more likely to gamble and vote for extreme, disastrous politicians like Jeremy Corbyn.Even younger people who are earning decent wages feel squeezed, because they face a combination of high house prices and chunky repayments on their student loans.The Prime Minister is acutely aware of this. That’s why she’s set up a review of student fees, and moved to make housing her Number  priority other than Brexit.Hence her announcement of massive funding to build more affordable housing for people on lower incomes. But there’s much more to do.Building more homes for people to buy is a big part of the answer. Since  we have built only half as many houses as France each year, and so house prices have gone up twice as fast.Some people say building more means we must tear up the planning system and concrete over the countryside.But we know that approach won’t work. When Gordon Brown was PM we tried setting each area massive housing targets. All those targets built was resentment. We need a smarter approach to tackle the reasons people often oppose new housing.We build in the wrong places. Instead of tacking on new estates to existing towns and villages without enough new school places or parking places, let’s get back into the business of building planned new cities and towns.Let’s build upwards in our city centres with taller buildings, rather than just sprawling cities outwards.What drives people mad is seeing developers make massive windfall profits when they get planning permission, but then not sharing those benefits with local residents.Imagine instead,new houses being built next door always paid for people in neighbouring streets to get cheap homes for their children to buy. People would feel much better about development.Restoring the dream of home ownership isn’t just about building more houses though.We need to think about the balance of rented properties and home ownership. Over the last ten years we’ve built many new homes each year, but the number of homeowners fell. How come The reason is that the number of properties being snapped up by buy-to-let landlords has grown faster than we have built new ones.Don’t get me wrong. Landlords, who have themselves worked hard, weren’t doing anything wrong.Butwe want to get home ownership growing again we need to encourage savers to put their money into shares and into growing businesses rather than just bidding up the price of houses. The think tank Onward proposed this week that we should offer a tax break to landlords who sell their homes to their tenants.This “Chance to Buy” would be a bit like the Right to Buy Margaret Thatcher introduced for council tenants. It could be paid for by tax changes which would discourage people from buying up new buy-to-let properties.So fewer landlords, more homeowners.Young people just want the same chances previous generations enjoyed. So let’s build more by building smarter, and give a new generation the chance to buy a home.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The ‘average’ survival time would be a matter of days.Leave your house behind and head for isolation and make your first destination a camping shop for warm clothing, waterproofs and some sturdy hiking boots.Rely on a car GPS device instead of smart phone maps – you’ll soon be losing phone signal when power grids go down.Dartnell, who is a professor of science communication at the University of Westminster, and wrote The Knowledge: How to Rebuild our World from Scratch, added: Chapstick, Vaseline and hairspray are all great for helping get a fire started in dficult conditionsWith regard to weapons I suggest relying on your own ingenuity and resourcefulness, fashioning what you need from metal pipes or nails.”The study of , Brits also found the average adult believes they could evade a zombie bite for just over nine weeks,  hours and  minutes.Even NOW TV’s The Walking Dead could double up as a survival tool, as  per cent said they would scour Zombie TV shows for tips on how to stay alive.Make your first destination a camping shop for warm clothing, waterproofs and hiking boots. You’ll be spending a lot of time outdoors, and when you’re running away you don’t want to slip and break an ankle.Buy iodine tablets to pury water once the taps run dry. There’s no point in surviving a zombie attackyou’re just going to die from a waterborne disease.Rely on a car GPS device instead of smart phone maps to find minor roads.  You’ll lose phone signal when power grids go down.A plastic bottle must become your new best friend. If it’s summer, disinfecting drinking water by simply leaving it in the sun for a day can become a regular part of your routine An unraveled tampon makes an ideal dressing to stop a wound bleeding, and it’s perfect kindling for starting a fire.A condom can hold over a gallon of water. Don’t let it rupture in your bag.Chapstick, Vaseline and hairspray - all great for helping get a fire started in dficult conditions.Once the refined fuels have disappeared, cars can actually be run using wood as fuel. The process is called ‘gasication’ and was common in WWII. Leave your house behind and head for isolation.Get out of the city. Not only will they have the highest concentrations of roamers, but urban areas simply won’t be habitable once technology disappears.Head into the countryside and find traditional buildings with fireplaces and wells. A seaside region near a large wood is your ideal new home, offering you access to a wide range of natural resources.Ideally, a secluded spot with high walls or fences will help keep the swarms of walkers out when you’re settling down more permanently.Stick together - youll never survive the apocalypse as a lone wolf. Theres safety in numbers, but be careful who you pick as friends.Send scouting parties to find other pockets of survivors, or rig-up a radio transmitter.In the early stages of a zombie attack you can scavenge food from abandoned supermarkets or distribution centres. Prioritise canned food that will keep for years.If you forget your tin opener grind the top of the can in flat circles pushing down onto a paving slab. You’ll quickly wear away the thin metal lip and get that lid off.The power grid is out: but don’t worry, you can stay connected. Scavenge a mobile generator from roadworks.When the diesel runs out, you will need renewables: scavenge solar  or small wind turbines.The best kind of rechargeable battery is a deep-cycle lead acid battery. Scavenge these from things like golf buggies. Surprisingly, a golf course is one of the most practical places to head for after an apocalypse.Always dig your DIY loos at least  meters away from your water source and downhill, for obvious reasons.Washing your hands. Soap can be made from scratch by soaking water through the ashes of burned seaweed to extract soda, and then reacting this with slaked limeto make caustic soda. Boil this with lard, or any other animal fat or plant oil, to make soap.If you injure yourself, attend to the wound immediately. You can disinfect with alcohol and then close the wound with superglue.Stream season  of The Walking Dead now on NOW TV with a contract-free Entertainment Pass.

But No aides played down hopes of any break through, with one telling The Sun: “We’re a way off yet”.Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson also issued a fresh attack on the PM to warn that the Government’s “backstop” proposals for Northern Ireland would make the UK “a permanent EU colony”.Labour MPs also dismissed claims that  of them will defy their own party whip top vote for the PM’s deal, saying Mrs May would struggler to even persuade over  of them.Mr Corbyn’s spokesman said: “It’s quite clear that the Prime minister is in a very dficult position because she spent most of the last two years negotiating with her own party and not with the European Union and the prospects of a signicant rebellion among her own MPs is pretty clear. So it’s not surprising that she’s trying to find support where and we’ve made very clear what kind of package we would support and what we won’t.”The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier last night said a Brexit deal is “within reach”, raising hopes of a breakthrough at next Wednesday’s crucial summit and boosting the pound.Amid expectations of a compromise on the Irish border, he hit back at Arlene Foster’s claim the EU’s backstop would devastate Northern Ireland’s economy.But he warned some checks between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain will increase tenfoldthe UK doesn’t stay in the customs union.Speaking to business leaders in Brussels the Frenchman said there “must be checks on goods travelling between the EU and UK that don’t exist today”.He said all live animals and animal derived food will have to be checked compared to just % now, which was “a signicant change in terms of scale”.Under his backstop plan other goods would be subject to “scanning barcodes on ferries or in transit ports” helped by Max Fac style trusted trader schemes.Mr Barnier said: “There must be checks on goods travelling between the EU and the UK – checks that do not exist today.“We’re still open to the idea of a customs union with the UK which would eliminate an important part of customs checks.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I still can’t believe it.In March last year, a jihadi went on a rampage in Westminster.Then he smashed into the perimeter fence and entered New Palace Yard, a few dozen feet away from where our politicians were gathered.Armed with a kne, he attacked anyone he saw. He murdered PC Keith Palmer.And now the thing that beggars belief. At that very moment, the acting commissioner of the politan Police, Craig Mackey, was leaving the scene in a car. He was inches away from Masood.He was only a few feet away when the Islamic terrorist was busy stabbing his colleague, PC Palmer.He watched the stabbing take place. And what did he do  He drove off, sharpish, having locked the windows of his car.He told an inquest into the murder: “I was in shirt-sleeves with no radio. We had no protective equipment.“The way the male came in, he was clearly a threat.“The attacker had one of those looks where,they get you in that look, they would be after you.”So he skedaddled as fast as he could, actually driving right past Masood.It has a Monty Python ring to it.“When danger reared its ugly head, Sir Craig bravely turned and fled . . .”How, I wondered, could he possibly do that  I thought one of the requirements for being a copper was a certain bravery and, you know, a vague interest in apprehending criminals Also, Masood seemed a bit nasty. He had “one of those looks”.No s**t, Sherlock. This is cowardice and, to my mind, a gross dereliction of duty.At the very least, he could have opened the car door to distract the attacker.Nope, not Sir Craig. If he’d done something — anything — poor PC Palmer might be alive today. Various senior ex-coppers have called for Mackey to be booted out, right now. and stripped of his knighthood.Incidentally, he was bunged the knighthood in this year’s New Year’s honours, partly for hugely reducing the number of stop-and-searches in London. That’s what the lefties wanted at the time.They bleated that stop-and-search was racist. Craig was only too happy to oblige. Oh, the irony of it.It’s thought ending stop-and-search contributed to the jamboree of stabbings we have seen in London this year.You wonder how Mackey has lived with himself these last  months. And how he can possibly retain the respect of his less well-remunerated colleagues.But it tells you a lot about the way our police forces are run these days.Their political grandstanding on “hate-speech” issues.Their reluctance to engage in the dficult, nasty side of policing, such as stopping real villains going about their work.Resign, Sir Craig.At least salvage a little bit of dignity by doing that.She turns them all down because they were too small. Or not in a nice area. We even offered to bung her £, for a deposit on a home.Now the woman has sued her local authority for infringing her human rights.Listen, love, they’re not half as infringed as they would beI had my way.You’d be dropped from a plane into Aleppo . . . and you’d have to crowd-fund the parachute. WIND turbines are a blight on the landscape.They deliver very little energy for their monstrous size.

Not generating very much electricity.And causing misery wherever they are.APPARENTLY William Shakespeare disliked women because one of them gave him a dose.This is according to a new study by someone who probably hasn’t got a Scooby.The theory is that Will copped syphilis off some unwholesome Tudor bint and this coloured his opinion towards women for ever.“Is this a dagger I see before me ”No, mate.

The moron hordes descended upon Kelly, pictured.They demanded he “educate himself”, saying Churchill was a racist, imperialist murderer. The usual rot.Kelly was forced to apologise, though he should never have done so. Sure, Churchill possessed a few views which today we would find a little, er, problematic.

The mood, especially in the East, is turning. A backlash against Germanys immigration policy and a pick-up in migrant-related crime. Its very far from being just the neo-Nazis. The populist Alternative for Germany party or AfD has made huge gains off the back of its anti-migrant messaging. It is now the largest opposition party in the parliament with a loud and heckling voice to match. It is hoovering up voters disenchanted with the centrist parties and it is emboldening the extremist fringe.The pot boiled over in August in the city of Chemnitz. A German citizen was fatally stabbed in a fight with two asylum seekers. Straight away the far right rallied, but in the days that followed thousands of concerned citizens came out too - angry that they should feel unsafe on their streets and angry at what they called the lying press for refusing to hear their point of view. \"Im not a Nazi but...\" was a common refrain from people who felt that simply voicing their concerns on migration would see them labelled as such. The mainstream media was accused of backing Mrs Merkel and being on the side of refugees. \"Luegenpresse\"echoed through the streets, a term coined by Hitlers propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. Not a huge leap from there to Donald Trumps \"enemy of the people\".The AfD has capitalised on this kind of sentiment, stirring the pot through social media to embellish the migrant threat and playing on the notion of victimhood to further its cause. The gist of it being that the German people are both the victims of an influx of asylum seekers who threaten to destroy the very notion of the homeland and the victims of a mainstream media which seeks to besmirch their good name. Talk of rapes, the threat to German wives and daughters, \"kne migration\", catch on especially in the former East where contact with foreigners under socialism was few and far between. In Chemnitz the AfD held a memorial procession for the German victims of migrant-related crime. The partys leader in Thuringia, Bjoern Hoecke, was up front. He was strongly criticised for the company he was keeping, marching alongside the anti-Islam Pegida group with neo-Nazi and skinheads among the crowds.\"With a procession of , people attending you cant fully control whos walking along and who isnt,\" he said."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/10/2048x1152/skynews-teenagers-saturday-job_4449040.jpg?20181010141246 ","title":"end of the saturday job teens prefer casual work","story":"Many said they are choosing to not work at all as they are concerned a job could be a distraction from schoolwork, the survey found.Two-fthsof parents with teens not working said they want their children to concentrate on their studies instead.However, many parents said when they worked as a teenager it benefited them, with % saying it taught them a good work ethic.% said it taught them to manage money and % said it helped them discover how to budget.Steve Ferrari, managing director of childrens savings at OneFamily, said: \"We would encourage parents to see the benefits of their children working while studying."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/10/2048x1152/skynews-obesity-fat_4449503.jpg?20181011014133 ","title":"i dont need reminding i dont like myself campaign to end the stigma of obesity","story":"Maggie Clinton, now aged , has suffered discrimination since childhood when she was even picked on by a teacher and it got no better when she entered the world of work as a nurse and later a senior lecturer in paediatrics.\"On one occasion I was told I had to go and buy my own unorm -

Meanwhile, other pupils were able to sit and play freely. The Mirror is not naming the family to protect the child’s identity. When his parents discovered  months ago what had occurred, they asked for an apology and an assurance the action would never be repeated. But no apology was forthcoming and they contacted Social Services and their son’s psychiatrist advised them their claims were a “child protection matter”.  Social services made a complaint to the PSNI and wrote to the child’s psychiatrist stating: “We fear [the child] suffered wilful or neglectful failure to prevent injury and suffering, and confinement defined as physical abuse under Social Services procedure.” His parents made an official complaint citing negligence and breach of duty by the school, the Education Authority and the Department of Education but say they have been left in limbo.An internal Education memo, seen by the Mirror, states on June  the parents’ complaints should be registered with Internal Audit as a “potential whistleblowing case”. The mum said: “Our son was tethered like an animal. He’s a placid boy, all his assessments show that. He is physically fit and active with some challenging behaviour but there’s never been a need to restrain him. “Those chairs are made for children who need to be elevated and angled to the right position, not our son. “We didn’t realise what had been going on until he actually managed to show us himself. Our son is autistic and non-verbal, but until this he’d always been happy, cheerful and easy company. “Quite suddenly his personality changed and for the best part of a year we were going rapidly downhill. He was tortured, demented. I was really concerned that he was going out of his mind. “He was so distressed and agitated, having panic attacks, suffering night terrors and he was acting very strangely, a totally dferent little boy to the one we knew and he couldn’t tell us why.  “He started staying in the chair at the dinner table and got very distressedwe tried to get him out of it. His psychiatrist has since told us she believes he’d been conditioned to sitting in a chair. “We’d no idea he was restrained in a chair in school and we hadn’t given our permission for that. But we were told by other parents they’d seen our son being wheeled in the chair but when we asked the school, they denied it.”His dad added: “We took our son out of school and I home schooled him and for weeks he was still distressed but he started to heal. “His smile came back, his anxiety lted, his distress lessened and he was able to go back to school with dferent teachers who have been brilliant. “We are battling for his dignity and his rights that we believe were violated by the very people who should have protected them.”  Human rights lawyer Kevin Winters has agreed to take on the case. He said: “This child has suffered emotionally and the concern is that that emotional suffering will have impacted on his education and to that end, his human rights are engaged.” A National Association of Head Teachers spokesperson, representing the school’s prinicpal, said: “There is an ongoing investigation into these allegations. Our member is complying fully with the investigation.” An Education Authority spokesman said in order to protect the confidentiality of the child, it cannot comment. The Department of Education and the PSNI were also contacted for comment.

The business that sells and distributes Cadbury products in Britain paid no corporation tax here last year even though its profits rocketed by more than % to poundmillion. Mondelez UK Ltd – the biggest British offshoot of the US owner of chocolate giant Cadbury – managed to offset its profits to help wipe out the potential poundmillion tax bill. And while the public purse missed out, the company channelled a idend of nearly poundmillion offshore to its immediate parent company, headquartered in low-tax Switzerland. Mondelez UK Ltd is one of a network of  British subsidiary companies of the US parent. An investigation by the Mirror can reveal these offshoots paid pound.million combined in corporation tax last year on profits of pound.billion.  Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: “This is outrageous. Time and time again we’ve warned the Government this type of behaviour is unacceptable. “We have told them they urgently need to tighten the rules on tax avoidance. “This will do nothing but anger people who are going out to work every day, paying their taxes through PAYE. “The Government has to act now to crack down on tax avoidance.” Alex Cobham, chief executive of the Tax Justice Network, called what Mondelez was doing “a piece of financial engineering that is very sad given Cadbury’s long history of working to generate value in the communities where they work”.  He added: “Mondelez are stripping value out, by siphoning off taxable profits from the UK through large intra-group idend payments. It is a problem with international tax rules.” He called on Chancellor Philip Hammond to use this month’s Budget to enact powers which the Treasury already has to force multinationals to produce country by country accounts. These would show the total profit made for all their companies in each market and the tax paid. Our revelations will compound criticism of Chicago-based Mondelez International, which when it was known as Kraft, was controversially allowed to buy Cadbury for pound.billion in .  In , shortly before it was bought by Kraft, Cadbury paid poundmillion in corporation tax. Things changed after Kraft won control of the business. Around  jobs were lost when Kraft axed Cadbury’s Somerdale factory in Keynsham, near Bristol. Production was moved to Poland instead. Then it axed hundreds of jobs at Bournville in Birmingham. Mondelez has also been criticised for decisions such as reducing the size of tubs of Heroes, and dumping the Fairtrade cocoa certication in favour of its own scheme.  Accounts for Mondelez UK, which sells other brands as well as Cadbury products, show its turnover rose from pound.billion to pound.billion. Its profits leapt from poundmillion to nearly poundmillion. The surge was mainly due to poundmillion of idends from two subsidiaries, coming from a coffee business in the Netherlands and the sale of its Terry’s chocolate business. This cash offset its profits and helped cut the corporation tax – which is payable on profits – to zero. The practice is not uncommon, but experts say the tax would usually have been paid by the two subsidiaries. Yet accounts for the two showed one paid no tax and the other just pound,. The accounts for Mondelez UK even showed a tax credit of pound,.  A spokesman insisted: “This is an accounting item and is not a tax or cash credit.” Mondelez added: “In common with all global businesses, we pay corporation tax based on the laws of the countries in which we operate. “We comply with all applicable tax legislation in the UK, as directed by HMRC and the Government. We [pay] tax in more than  countries, and on a global basis pay hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate income tax annually. We are a signicant contributor to the UK economy, through direct spending on employees and suppliers, and the recirculation of that expenditure in the economy. “We are investing in our business here and since  are proud to have invested over poundmillion in UK-based manufacturing and RD supporting our , employees in the UK.” Mondelez International also owns Kenco, Bassett’s and Oreo.Campaign group Tax Justice UK is demanding changes, such as raising corporation tax from % to %, to rake in over poundbillion for the NHS.We must nail the myth that we are all avoiders nowCOMMENT By Paul Monaghan Of the Fair Tax Mark Another day, another set of impenetrable figures. This time it’s Mondelez UK and connected company Cadbury UK, which has just reported a seventh year of zero corporation tax payments. These tax avoidance stories create an impression that everyone is “at it”. A myth has been spun telling us thatwe buy duty-free, invest in an ISA or top up our pension we are tax avoiders – so should back off criticising the likes of Amazon and Facebook. Wrong. No tax is being avoided as no tax is due. Those who say we should feel guilty are likely seeking to de-stigmatise the immorality of tax avoidance. In recent years, HMRC has begun to clamp down on avoidance – which it describes as “bending the rules to gain an advantage Parliament never intended” – and evasion, which is illegal. It is estimated the cost to the UK is poundbillion a year – , nurses. Campaigners want multinationals to be forced by governments to produce country-by-country reports of income, profit and taxes. Thankfully a growing movement of firms here – Lush, Timpson, SSE, and the Co-op included – are backing the Fair Tax Mark. In  a group of MPs forced an amendment to a bill requiring large corporations to report country-by-country. It’s time to enact those powers and for the UK to take the lead on tax transparency.

Among other things it sold cocoa and drinking chocolate – seen as an alternative to alcohol, which Quakers deemed bad for society. The firm began manufacturing in , and by  it was selling  types of drinking chocolate. The business passed to sons Richard and George who, at the end of the s, moved the chocolate factory out of the Birmingham slums and into what became the leafy suburb of Bournville.  They added a village green and cricket pavilion. Cadbury milk chocolate bars followed in , then Bournvillle dark chocolate in , then a host of others. In  came the company’s Glass And A Half symbol for Dairy Milk. Cadbury merged with Schweppes in , but split in . In , Cadbury was bought by Kraft, despite opposition. Kraft boss Irene Rosenfeld, who masterminded the deal, pocketed a poundmillion pay and perks deal the previous year. Takeover action leaves bad taste The anger sparked by the sale of Cadbury to US-based giant Kraft prompted an investigation in Parliament. And when Kraft broke a promise to keep open the Cadbury factory near Bristol the deal was only just sealed. In , it was slammed for scrapping an annual Christmas gt box to retired staff to cut costs and for shaving g off each Dairy Milk bar but nothing off the price. In , Kraft ended a Christmas tradition by stopping making its iconic chocolate coins. It triggered furore in  by changing the recipe for its best-selling Cadbury Creme Egg. The shell of Cadbury Dairy Milk was dropped in favour of what critics complained was an inferior version. Earlier this year Cadbury chocolate bars were banned from NHS buildings in a row over prices. The firm which supplies hundreds of hospitals refused to stock brands such as Dairy Milk, Wispa and Crunchie.

Sean Coyle visited his daughter Lauren Coyles home to find -month-old Ella-May Minshull-Coyle unresponsive and clammy in the bed at her flat in Preston, Lancashire. Ellie-May was allegedly bound by her legs and across her chest and forced to sleep face down in the bed converted into a monstrous cage, a jury at Liverpool Crown Court has heard. A post-mortem examination found that Ellie-May, described as otherwise healthy, fit and full of le, died due to forcible restraint by ligatures in a face down position complicated by hyperthermia. The bed Ellie-May slept in, a purple Frozen bed based on the Disney childrens film, was allegedly turned into a prison by the childs stepfather Reece Hitchcott, , with the help of their lodger Connor Kirby, .  It is alleged Ellie-Mays mother, stepfather and lodger, living with the child in the two-bedroom flat at Ward Street in Lostock Hall, all knew what was going on. All three deny manslaughter on March  last year. A week before Ellie-Mays death, her grandfather Mr Coyle told the court he and his we Louise visited the flat and Hitchcott showed them the bed. Mr Coyle described it as: Some kind of thing, something that should be in hell, some kind of frame. It had some kind of sheeting over it. There was a gap at one end so you could push it against the wall, so it became a prison for her.  Well the first thing I thought was, What the hell is this  He said Hitchcott told him it was to assist the child as she had struggled getting into a sleeping pattern. Mr Coyle said his we told the stepfather to take it down as it was dangerous and the child may smother herself. At around .am on March  last year, Mr Coyle visited the flat again after his daughter had messaged him to say she had been up all night with Ellie-May. Mr Coyle told the court he said wheres princess  as he entered but when he got to the bedroom he saw Hitchcott crouched down beside the bed. The witness continued: She did not look right, there was something definitely wrong with her. He said Ellie-Mays eyes rolled back in her head and she looked clammy and he ran to ring for an ambulance before commencing mouth-to-mouth and CPR.  The child was pronounced dead later that day in hospital. She was allegedly tied to the mattress of her bed with tight ligatures across her chest and legs and a duvet placed over her. Her bed had been pushed against a wall and the open sides enclosed by the slatted sides of a cot lashed together with ligatures and electrical flex and tied to the bed frame, the court heard. Sheets and bedding were placed over the sides to prevent her seeing outside, no lights were working inside her bedroom and a mattress and sheet were also covering the window, the court was told.

The bugs, known as Harlequin Ladybirds, are said to be seeking cosy hibernation spots - targeting homes across the country as many of us turn our heating on in time for autumn. Flying in from Asia and North America, the tiny insects have black instead of red wings and are spreading rapidly across England and Wales. British heptathlete and GB Olympian Kelly Sotherton tweeted a horrying video of hundreds of ladybirds crawling around her window and across the ceiling. She said: Get home and welcomed by swarms of ladybirds in every window #ladybirdinvasion.  Twitter user DoubleIn compared the scene to that of a Biblical plague. Many people have been turning to social media to show the extent of the invasion in their area - with some getting plastered in the little bugs while out dog walking. Shakira Phillips was staying in a Premier Inn in East Sussex when she spotted the bugs gathered in the corner of a window.  While Laura Jayne sent theimages of her covered in the ladybirds after taking her dogs for a walk in Bramcote Park, Ilkeston. Lauras trousers were plastered in the little red bugs after she walked through thousands of them in mid-air. She said: I took my dogs for a walk around Bramcote park in Ilkeston and there was a huge ladybird swarm. Must of been thousands flying around in just one area.  Laura Barnes also revealed how the bugs had invaded her home and gathered around her front door and behind furnitire. Kathryn Typer also uploaded an image of the bugs crawling over her walls and ceiling. She said: Losing my s**t here over the little buggers. Jake Outrim also spotted the creepy crawlies scampering across his window. Experts say the foreign invaders actually pose a threat to the domestic species because they carry a sexually-transmitted disease called Laboulbeniales fungal disease. Steve McGrail, director of pest control company Pro Kill Environment, said Harlequin Ladybirds are not harmful to humans but recommended sealing windows to make sure they do not get in homes.  He said: “They are a non-indigenious species. They are coming inside in large numbers. “They usually cluster around window frames and they cluster together to gather heat and hibernate in winter months.” Scientists say a fungus the creatures carry, which is passed on through mating, will infect our native species which are already under threat from habitat loss. While they do not yet knowthe fungus is harmful, the UK Ladybird Survey says it is possible the disease affects the lespan or the number of eggs a female can produce over her lespan.

The -year-old opted for a pound, Erdem off-the-shoulder burgundy, black and white boucleacute-tweed midi dress encrusted with crystal and faux pearl embellishments. She paired it with wine-hued velvet Jimmy Choo heels and had faux crystal and peal floral Erdem earrings on. The dress was inspired by the Queens love of jazz and Erdem designed it around what Her Majesty might have worn to Harlems Cotton Club.  The Duchess of Cambridge ed to royal duties last week following the birth of Prince Louis in April. Her first official event was a visit to wildle garden in London last week and yesterday she attended the first Global Ministerial Mental Health Summit with Prince William. Kate was revealed as the first Royal Patron of the museum in March. Kensington Palace said her patronage furthers Kate’s “interest in the visual arts, photography and design.” And the duchess, who studied art history at university, showed her expertise in the field during her visit tonight, according to Martin Barnes, the museums senior curator of the exhibition. She is a really knowledgeable student in art history, so she understood about the technology behind the photos, he said. I really got a sense of her knowledge and interest in how it is relevant today but how its history informs its present.  Kate toured the opening display at the Photography Centre entitled Collecting Photography: From Daguerreotype to Digital. The display explores photography from the medium’s invention in the th century to the present day. The new Photography Centre more than doubles the space currently devoted to it in the museum. Prints, negatives, camera equipment, photographic publications and original documents will be displayed together to tell a broader story of international photography. Paul McCartneys photographer daughter Mary McCartney has donated  of her own photos and the former Beatles frontman donated  works by her late we, Linda. Drawn from the VA’s collection of over , photographs, the display showcases contemporary photography alongside seminal prints by pioneers William Henry Fox Talbot, Julia Margaret Cameron and Roger Fenton.  During her tour of the exhibition, The Duchess met curators who have worked on the project, before unveiling a plaque to mark the official opening of the Centre. A frequently changing selection of new acquisitions, a ‘Light Wall’ for displaying the most cutting-edge photographic imagery, and a ‘Dark Tent’ projection area complete the new space. Kate is a keen photographer herself and some of her photos of her children have been released as official portraits. The art history graduate became a Patron of the National Portrait Gallery in  and last year became an Honorary Member of the Royal Photographic Society.

Helen Wood, , was devastated when the  had to be added to the pale green satin gown just weeks before her best friends big day.Manchester Evening News reports that the business support officer, who works in the city, had to have the dress altered from a size  to  to ensure it fit her.Previously weighing  stone lb, the mum-of-two from Blackburn, said she stuck out like a sore thumb in every picture. When she saw the photos, Helen vowed never again to be a fat bridesmaid and slimmed down to an incredible size , now weighing just  stone.  It was horrendously embarrassing for me, watching my best friend get married and feeling like the fat bridesmaid, Helen said. “I stood out like a sore thumb in all the pictures, and when I actually saw the images taken I cried and cried.” Despite previously shting eight stone in  thanks to diet and exercise, Helen relapsed after meeting her husband, Matt and having two children. Admitting that she squeezed into size  clothes at her biggest, she recalled: “Matt was working in Manchester when we met, so I would stay over a lot and we’d go out for dinners, have drinks and le became really comfortable. “I’d lost the weight before by cutting out the rubbish and exercising every day, but I gave all that up when I met Matt and we fell in love.” Skipping breakfast, Helen would snack on crisps, before having a cheese and ham sandwich with a chocolate bar for pudding at lunch and a double portioned pasta meal, slathered in creamy tomato sauce for dinner. But her real downfall was her nightly ritual of a family-size bar of chocolate with a cup of tea in bed. Gorging on , calories a day and never exercising, after giving birth to Jack in  she made no effort to sht the “baby weight. Then, after having Emilie in July , Helen soared to a hefty size . But with her best friend, Kelly, , due to marry that October and with a size  dress bought for the occasion, Helen panicked.  “I was so touched when my childhood friend Kelly asked me to be her maid of honour, and with just three months to go until the big day, I was determined to get into the gown, but deep down knew I wouldn’t,” she said. “With a new baby and a toddler, I struggled to find the time to concentrate on my weight so, before I knew it, the wedding was weeks away and I was still fat.” Knowing the dress would never fit, she visited a tailor, asking her to make it bigger by adding  into the sides, so she could wear it. She said: “I looked dferent to everyone  and really stood out. Another bridesmaid was pregnant at the time and I actually looked bigger than she did. “The dress wasn’t the same as everyone ’s because of the alterations and I felt larger than I ever had. “I made Matt delete all the photos he took of me and cried my eyes out.” Vowing to change, it took Helen seven months to summon the courage to contact the weight loss company, Cambridge Weight Plan. “My mum suggested I gave it a go, as they offer one to-one support and create a personalised plan,” she said.  “I couldn’t face going to slimming classes and being with lots of people I didn’t know.” In her first two weeks, Helen lost lb by eating and drinking only the Cambridge Weight Plan products, before slowly incorporating exercise into her regime, too. Now,  months on, she has even become a Cambridge Weight Plan consultant and has never felt better. “I’ve got a split-picture on my phone background - one photo is of me now and one is me at my largest. When I showed my little boy, he didn’t know who the larger woman was,” she smiled.

Adam Thomas, , and his partner Claudia Patatas, , gave their child the middle name Adolf, which the prosecution has alleged was in honour of the infamous Nazi leader Hitler. On Wednesday, a court also heard how Patatas had allegedly sent a WhatsApp message reading all Jews must be put to death, while Thomas bemoaned the fact he had a fat P**i as a work colleague. Jurors were also shown another image, said to be of Thomas in a Klansmens robe and brandishing a machete in front of a Confederate flag.  The flag was shown hanging over a sofa, on which were two scatter cushions each bearing the Swastika. The couple also allegedly had a poster stuck to their fridge reading Britain is ours - the rest must go. The Crown have further claimed the couple were pictured at home with another man, a convicted racist and vehement Nazi, who was holding a Swastika flag and performing a Hitler-style salute over their baby. Thomas and Patatas, both of Banbury, Oxfordshire, are on trial at Birmingham Crown Court accused of being members of the far-right terrorist group National Action, banned in December . Co-defendant Daniel Bogunovic, , of Leicester, is also in the dock facing the same membership charge. Thomas is facing a separate charge of having a terrorist document, the Anarchy Cookbook, which contained bomb-making instructions. Barnaby Jameson QC, prosecuting, showed jurors a series of photographs said to be of Thomas in KKK robes, including one with the child. He said: The suggestion is that is Mr Thomas and his child, whose middle name is Adolf.  Turning to an image of a hooded man with a machete, Mr Jameson added: There is a strong inference, and youll appreciate this when you look inside the Thomas and Patatas house, that that was taken inside their home, and that the person in the robes was Thomas. It emerged in court that counter-terrorism officers from Prevent had visited the couples home in October last year due to concerns Ms Patatas may be involved in the extreme right wing. However, an online chat message allegedly sent by Thomas showed he was unfazed. He said: I have my flags up, lol - and f**k social services, they have no basis of claim of anything. In a message from work that Thomas is said to have sent to Patatas, bemoaning his colleagues in September , he said: A fat half bred n****r who is typical of the Birmingham type of mongrel, a fat p**i and a black as hell Rastafarian. What Ive found is that all non-whites are intolerable but the ones who have lived here most of their lives are even worse.

Ferrell Johnson had believed the operation would give her a new lease of le after years of suffering back pain. But the estate agent, , says she now needs her son to follow her around to check the third breast isnt showing. Ferrell, from Marysville, Calornia, went under the kne in March  to have her large E cup boobs reduced. But, instead of the smaller bosom she was hoping for, Ferrell, who has been left with fat necrosis - a lump of dead and damaged tissue - said: I’ve been left in a mess. She added: I have a fat necrosis in my right breast, and a third breast- made up of fat and tissue - under my arm. “The first time I saw the lump in the mirror, I cried and cried. I’ve always been a go-getter, so it isn’t in my nature to feel this way.  “This has caused so many emotional issues. I’m constantly so conscious of what I wear and how I move, as the breast can fall out of the side of my top. I’m horried at the thought of being seen in public like that.” Now Ferrell, whose procedure was covered by her medical insurance, faces complete reconstructive surgeryshe wants to correct her breasts. Always busty, she recalled reaching a D cup by the time she was  - with her bust continuing to grow when she gained weight over the years, which led to her experiencing back problems. She had long-planned to have reduction surgery – but the idea was put on the back-burner following the tragic death of her son Cortneywho took his own le in , when he was .  “He was always so well loved, really charismatic and bright,” she said. “After he passed, I could barely do anything. I struggled so much with my grief. “My operation was supposed to be a way of me regaining my confidence and getting back out there – I can’t believe this is how things turned out.” Meeting with a surgeon early last year, Ferrell hoped to go back down to a D cup - though ended up being taken to a B cup - and was not worried about what she thought was a routine operation. She added: “I went under general anaesthetic for the procedure in March , so by the time I woke up, the damage was already done.” Required to wear surgical bras and bandages, it took about two weeks for Ferrell to see what had actually happened - although she felt discomfort under her right arm, which she thought was just her body recovering. “I was incredibly careful about keeping the area clean. I had a nurse friend help me out, and she wore surgical gloves to take my dressings off,” she said. “The first time I properly saw myself, I was home alone and caught sight of a lump in the mirror. I took a proper look and just burst into tears. It looked literally like a third breast.”  Next, Ferrell began noticing a worrying fatty discharge, which she believes was coming from her breasts. She continued: “I was excreting lumps out of my nipple. At first, they looked like long, thin worms, and I thought, ‘Oh my god, what is that ’ “Then one day, a marble-sized piece of tissue fell away. “Panicking, I raced to the emergency room of a nearby hospital, where they told me it looked like I’d had botched surgery. “I was put on antibiotics, but I have been left with some fatty lumps that need removing. There’s one piece of dead tissue in particular, measuring cm by cm, that causes severe pain.” Ferrell believes her problems were caused by her skin being pulled too tight during her breast reduction surgery. Now, her le turned upside down by what has happened, she is desperate to find another medic who can help reverse the damage. Meanwhile, her confidence has plummeted and she is now living as a virtual recluse. She said: “I struggle to go anywhere without my son Joe, . He’s had to take on an awful lot. I ask him to walk behind me to check that the lump under my arm isn’t showing. “It is softening and pushing back a little, but it’s still a third breast under my arm.  “Unfortunately, as it was elective surgery – something I chose to do – I’m not in a position where I can take legal action, but really, all I want is to fix this. “I can’t believe I’m now having to consider a full reconstruction, including implants, so I can look normal again. My insurance company have said they would help cover it but I need to lose a little weight before I can have the surgery and Im nervous to have another operation. Desperate, Ferrell has even written to reality show Botched, asking for help but, for now, all she can do is wait. She hopes that by sharing her story, she will encourage others to be cautious when selecting their own surgeons. “I have nothing against people having surgery, but you must be thorough with finding your doctor. If they evade questions or don’t make you feel  per cent comfortable, then avoid them,” she said. “Also, think very carefully and ensure you’re positive surgery is a move you want to make. “The past few years have been an awful lot to deal with, but I want my story out there to help other women.” "},{"url":null,"title":"stomach churning moment doctor removes","story":"NewsStomach-churning moment doctor removes cm-long parasitic worm from mans eyeWARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT - Doctors had to immediately remove the creature because it was putting the patients eyesight at riskShareCommentsByMark Morris:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video stomach-churning-moment-doctor-removes-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFootage has emerged of the disgusting moment doctors removed a large parasitic worm from a mans eye.

He has been receiving counselling at a special facility called Service for Healthy Use of Technologyin a bid to kick his compulsive need to escape reality.

The first thing he did at the start of each day was put the TV on lose himself in scripted entertainment. According to the Shut clinic, the young man soon found himself unable to develop any form of self-discipline and he suffered from lethargy, eye strain and deprived sleep. Experts have assigned him a therapy plan that includes relaxation activities, exercise and career guidance.

Goals give them that added confidence and there is also that perception that strikers, and rightly so, should be more responsible for scoring.“I loved how Sam took the ball in, linked the play and he was between the posts at the right time.“His two goals were good finishes.“Those goals should do Sam no harm.”Prior to his double against St Mirren, Cosgrove’s only other senior competitive goal came in a - League Two defeat of Crewe for Carlisle in January this year.He netted in a - friendly draw with Championship West Brom at Pittodrie in July.When McInnes signed Cosgrove in the winter transfer window he admitted the striker was one for this season.However, he pitched him in for a debut against Celtic less than a month later. It was a nightmare first Reds appearances as Cosgrove was red carded after just eight minutes of the - loss for a challenge on Hoops skipper Scott Brown.However, McInnes was always confident the striker would come good and is adamant he had already proven his worth before scoring the brace against the Buddies.McInnes said: “In the games that Sam has started we have not lost in  minutes so he has been effective for us.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds.

There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run.

Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::.

There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

It means the state-of-the-art school is well on track for opening its doors to pupils and staff in October . Built in the grounds of the existing academy, the new school is keenly anticipated as it’s set to not only transform learning and teaching, but will also signicantly enhance facilities for the local community. The new building will have space for up to  young people, with modern classrooms, massive games hall, two all-weather pitches, games courts and a host of other exciting facilities which are sure to impress pupils, staff and the wider public. Kier Construction is building the school, which is being delivered by South Ayrshire Council in partnership with hub South West. The project is part of a poundmillion programme of works delivered across South Ayrshire with the aim of boosting education standards through targeted investment in schools and communities. Councillor Peter Henderson, the council’s resources and performance portfolio holder, said: “Our new, extended and refurbished schools are completely transforming learning across South Ayrshire and the new Queen Margaret Academy is shaping up to do more of the same. We’re committed to creating modern learning environments that not only inspire children and young people, but provide an important hub and network for the local community. “We want those attending our schools to achieve their full potential when they move on from school and our focus on providing the best education possible, with the best facilities, means we are on our way to achieving this ambition. “Our schools always play a key role in local le so we’re ensuring that their excellent sports facilities can be accessed by the wider public. We also ensure there are areas of our schools that can be used by community groups and the new Queen Margaret Academy will be no dferent.” Michael McBrearty, chief executive of delivery partner, hub South West Scotland, said: “The new school will be a fantastic contemporary and innovative learning environment that will create an abundance of opportunities and benefits to the entire community.” Brian McQuade, managing director of Kier Construction Scotland  north-east England, said: “Up to  people have been on site during peak periods of activity and to date we have created one apprenticeship, seven work placements and three student summer intern placements. This has provided young local talent the opportunity to gain valuable experience working on a state-of-the-art building and a unique insight into the built environment and the erse range of roles available.” Oonagh Browne headteacher at Queen Margaret Academy said: “It’s exciting to see our new school taking shape. Parents, young people and staff were crucial in planning the facilities for our new school, so it’s very much their project and this only increases their anticipation”. The Bishop of Galloway, Right Reverend William Nolan said: “While the ground works were taking place little seemed to be happening on site but in recent months the structure of the building has sprung up, giving a sense of excitement and anticipation as we look forward to the completion next year of a centre of learning that will inspire our young people.” When the new school opens, the old building will be demolished and the site fully landscaped.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"60k christmas lights up grabs","story":"Alexandra McCready switches on the lights with the help of the cast of the Ayr Gaiety pantomime Cinderella.\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pound, Christmas lights fund is up for grabs in villages and towns needing an illumination boost. But where the cash goes will be decided by South Ayrshire council officials depending on the needs of dferent areas. The move was approved at the full council meeting last week after a heated clash between rival councillors. Councillor Hugh Hunter put forward a motion for pound, cash to be distributed with a maximum of pound going to each town and pound for villages. He said communities faced a major challenge to raise money for lights. He said the council’s “huge” underspend should be used to pay for the festive displays. But his seasonal gesture was snubbed by ruling councillors who backed an amendment from Councillor Alec Clark to make pound, available instead. Independent Councillor Clark said: “We will try and bring some joy into people’s lives.” His amendment said: “With this fund it is important that the funding does not supplant or compete with the work that has been taking place over a number of years.” Conservative Councillor Hunter questioned how communities were supposed to apply for the cash but was told there wouldn’t be an application process. Labour Councillor Brian McGinley said: “There has been an issue with Christmas lights over a number of years.” He added: “We don’t want to undo the good work already going on in the community.” Responding to probes from the conservative opposition, he said: “We will talk to people about the current arrangements and do what we can.” Councillor Hunter said: “I can’t support the amendment. I ask councillors to support the clear motion.” Speaking after the meeting, Councillor Hunter said: “It wasn’t clear how communities could access it. It is really foggy and disappointing that we couldn’t get to the bottom of it.” Councillor Bob Pollock said he is concerned “some areas may miss out.” He said there was “no coherent explanation” on how the money would be “decided or managed” with only six weeks left until switch on. In a press release Councillor McGinley said: “We obviously have a finite amount of resources, so we know that we won’t be able to do everything that communities want right away, but it’s a terric starting point that will support people and places right across South Ayrshire at this special time of year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilChristmasAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire student launches campaign against","story":"NewsAyrshire student launches campaign against spikingCara’s drive to keep young women safer when they’re out on the town.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsCara Taven has launched a Facebook page named Girls Against Spiking. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA campaign has been set up to raise awareness of people having their drinks spiked.

Cara, , told the Post about her campaign. She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know. It is about the community of girls my age. “ I just felt like the answer was there and no one has done anything about it until now.” The Post reported how Cleo Smillie, , from Ayr, was on a night out in Madrid with her friend, Marc Davies, when she blacked out after one sip of her pink gin and lemonade. It was later learned that she had a high level of GHB in her blood – the date-rape drug. Strathclyde Union is among the nightclubs and bars that were prompted by the campaign and have gone on to order  lids on a trial basis as they work on ways to keep students as safe as possible on nights out.

Arnold Clark took the decision to shut the twin showrooms and workshops in the town’s Lochside. The big transporters moved in to clear the stock and the famous yellow signage was quickly taken down. The old premises in Galloway Avenue sold cars for generations and was probably best known as the home of Robert McCall Fiat and Alfa Romeo. But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road. Arnold Clark also runs separate Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises in the town as well as a car and van hire centre. A long-time customer in Galloway Avenue said: “It is a real shame, but I guess dealerships want to be on busy roads in more modern buildings. Sadly Galloway Avenue would have needed a lot of investment and a member of staff said it simply was not in the right location any more. “Staff think the site could be flattened or put to another vehicle use.” Arnold Clark was unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsMotoring NewsAlfa RomeoFiatJaguarJeepPeugeotFishingPrestwickGalloway"},{"url":null,"title":"gymnastics club tries takeover council","story":"NewsGymnastics club tries to takeover council activity centre in TroonMuirhead Activity Centre is the target of Dundonald Gymnastics ClubShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA plan by a gymnastics club to take over Muirhead Activity Centre has met hostility. Secret talks have been taking place since the summer but have only just surfaced. Dundonald Gymnastics Club is ready to take control and turn the popular sports hall into a specialist centre. It would mean no more sports lets of the main hall for football, badminton and handball, the squash court would shut and the property would be shted from South Ayrshire Council ownership. Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association fired the first warning shot over the takeover. Chairman Frances Carson said: “The answer is no. If the council have pulled a fly one over this then they will never hear the end of it from this community.” Scott Telford, head coach of the gymnastics club, promised this week he will speak to the community about his ambitious plans. But Tory councillor Peter Convery slammed the secrecy, saying: “This came out of the blue to all the councillors and community and is an utter disgrace. “People at a meeting on Friday night were flabbergasted the hall could be taken out of council ownership. “The acid on the cake is the council has been speaking to the group without anyone knowing. “The council should not be treating its citizens this way.” Scott Telford said he has a full business plan for the centre and believes it can work. The club has  members and a waiting list of  more. He said the club have restricted facilities at their present base Dundonald Activity Centre, where five adults spend hours setting out and dismantling equipment. As a result they cannot develop youngsters to elite performance level and lose talented performers at an early age. Former top gymnast Scott, who lives in Muirhead, said: “The community will still get use of the centre for things like meetings and birthday parties and we would look to develop that. “There will also be the chance for the community to take part in gymnastics. “I appreciate people don’t like change but we can make this work. We could even look at parkour gymnastic sessions with teenagers on Friday night. “There is also a lot of outdoor space which we could change for other activities, depending on what the community want.” The dad first started helping at Dundonald when there were only  kids and ten mats. He added: “At the moment we get about  inquiries a week and just cannot cope. “I want to work with the Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association and want to hear all views. “We will be running a seven-day-a-week facility but it has to be financially sustainable and work with the community.” Councillor Craig Mackay said he wants full transparency when consultation starts. He said: “The onus will be on the gymnastics club to demonstrate the wider support of the community. “I am relaxed about the process and will very much wish to take on board the community’s views on this once we know the details of what is proposed. “I am concerned about how any potential transfer would impact on the use of the centre by the wide range of groups who currently use it. “The centre currently runs at a small but manageable loss and in my view any decision must be made on what is best for the community and not on the very minimal cost savings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsGymnasticsSouth Ayrshire CouncilBadmintonTroonDundonald"},{"url":null,"title":"shops replace homes new ayr","story":"NewsShops to replace homes in new Ayr town centre regeneration plansPeople to have their say on radical proposalsShareBySarah Hilley:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShops are to be replaced with homes in Ayr town centreradical new plans get the go-ahead. Proposals also include the High Street being coated with a new easy clean surface and bins being kept out of site. A great shop clearance has been proposed to regenerate the ailing shopping strip. South Ayrshire Council wants empty retail units to become homes at the bottom of the town. Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Internet shopping has signicantly altered the landscape in the town. “We need people back staying in the towns.” SNP Councillor Campbell took to his feet at week’s full council meeting to talk through the complete overhaul of the town centre. Conservative Councillor Ian Davis askedshop owners would be consultedthey are forced to move. He said: “This could mean some businesses will have to move. I want reassurances for businesses thatan area is to be reused for a dferent purpose that they are well consulted.” The meeting heard businesses would be consulted. The cleared Riverside block, which included Woolworths, would become a public square. The original proposal for a huge office block has been shelved. Commenting on the cleared site, Councillor Campbell said: “None of us expected the vista.” But he conceded how homes of some description could be erected on the site. He said: “Some sort of building on the site will be necessary.” A report submitted to council said: “There will also be the potential for a small number of residential units on the Riverside sitethis proves desirable through the public consultation exercise.” Council staff from soon-to-be demolished Burns House are likely to move into the Clydesdale Bank Building, the Town Hall and County Buildings instead. The Citadel is to be replaced with a brand new state-of-the art leisure centre on the High Street. A new streetscape surface could also be on the way. Councillor Campbell said: “If we are going to revamp the High Street we need to do it in a signicant way to keep it tidy. “During the main shopping times all the bins should be off the street. We need to present the High Street well. “We need to move the bus stops away from the Clydesdale Bank building.” Conservative opposition councillor Hugh Hunter got to his feet to “welcome” the report. He said: “It would be spectacular for the administrationthey could pull it off.” He called for a park like Belleisle to be built at the Riverside. SNP councillor Siobhian Brown said she welcomed the report but said morale of the community was “on its knees.” All plans will be issued for public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnClydesdale BankScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"slow progress new troon mega","story":"NewsSlow progress for new Troon mega surgeryBut work on Templehill expansion should start next yearShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNational Health top brass have been summoned to Troon to explain what is happening to expansion plans at the town’s mega surgery. Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September . The practice is optimistic that works will commence in early Januaryplanning permission is granted.” In other NHS news, it is understood community midwives have had to change their base from the Barassie Street clinic to Prestwick. One source said: “All that is left at Barassie Street seems to be podiatry. “The community nurses have to start their sht in Prestwick before coming to Troon for their first appointment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonNHS ScotlandAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"ians-in-the-saddle-for-poppyscotland","story":"A CYCLING challenge to commemorate the end of the First World War is being taken up in towns and villages across the Borders.Poppyscotland is inviting cyclists of all abilities to saddle up for , miles of riding in less than  days.And among the first to pull on his helmet is a former soldier from Hawick, who is already midway through completing the epic journey.Ian McLeod served with The Kingrsquos Own Scottish Borderers from  to  having joined up at the tender age of just  years old and nine months -

Special Scientic Interest due to its signicance in the work of famed natural scientist James Hutton.In , Hutton observed the angular unconformity at the site which provided the evidence needed for his Theory of the Earth ndash the never-ending cycles of creation and destruction that shape the landscape today.This theory overturned the last vestiges of the Biblical account of a world shaped by the

Fleming, Chief Financial Officer of Siccar Point Energy said: ldquoAs an oil and gas company geology is at the heart of what we do.ldquoHutton is an inspiring example of a scientist who followed the evidence and defied the conventional wisdom of the day.ldquoItrsquos a great example for a young company and a fascinating piece of Scottish history to preserve and to continue learning from.The

in both the concrete sections and steel reinforcements beneath the surface was much greater than initially anticipated.Amey announced that full night-time closures would be required to finish the deck repairs, waterproofing and resurfacing by the scheduled October .But with just over a week until the planned completion date they have extended the timescales through to November.And bosses have also announced that engineers willto complete the extensive repairs in February.Ameys bridges manager Stuart Wallace said: ldquoThese refurbishment works were originally intended to prevent the further deterioration of the bridge structure by repairing defects at an early stage.\"This work has subsequently uncovered several previously hidden defects that far exceeded expectations and this is the reason for the increase to the construction programme.Since the introduction of a one-way system for west-bound traffic across the bridge with east-bound vehicles having to use the winding B near Abbotsford, there have been many reports of drivers ignoring temporary road signs.And many other drivers are using Melrose Road and Lowood Bridge, which causes tailbacks at rush hour.Rather than continue with repairs to Galafoot over the festive period and into the new year, Amey has opted to finish on November  andthree months later.Mr Wallace added: ldquoThe local community has shown incredible patience and understanding with the repair programme to date.\"Having listened to their concerns, we consider it prudent to avoid further disruption over the busy holiday season.\"This strategy will also mitigate against the possible impact that winter weather might have on this workldquoOnce again, we want to thank road users, businesses and residents for their goodwill, and we

past year mdash and the aftershocks could cause more turbulence for Chancellor Angela Merkelrsquos struggling national government.Polls suggest Baiarsquos centre-right Christian Social Union party , which has run the region for  years, is heading for its worst performance since the s on Sunday.It appears to be losing voters on both the right and left despite enviable prosperity and unemployment at a rock bottom .%.The CSU, which is socially conservative and has taken a hard line on migration, exists only in Baia and is an important but often awkward sister to Mrs Merkelrsquos Christian Democratic Union .The two parties govern Germany in an infighting-prone coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats.Though the CSU is unlikely to lose power in Baia altogether, a result like the one pollsters are forecasting would be humiliating.Speculation is re that party leader Horst Seehofer, Germanyrsquos interior minister, could be forced out.ldquoThe CSU has lost its cohesive power in Baia mdash it was able to win over voters from the right to the centre-left, said Manfred Guellner, the head of the Forsa polling agency.ldquoNow, because of its confrontational course with its sister party, with the chancellor, it has driven away the liberal centre.On the other side, the far-right Alternative for Germany is appealing to voters looking for an uncompromising anti-migration and law-and-order stance.About . million people are eligible to vote in the election for the state legislature in Munich.For decades, the CSU attracted voters from across the spectrum, standing for a combination of modernity and tradition encapsulated by the slogan ldquoLaptops and Lederhosen.It has held an absolute majority in the state legislature for all but five of the last  years and prides itself on punching above its weight in national politics.Lately, that tradition has been evident largely in battles over migration between Mr Seehofer and Mrs Merkel.Mr Seehofer joined Mrs Merkelrsquos Cabinet in March after giving up his job as Baiarsquos governor to younger rival Markus Soeder following a long-running CSU power struggle.ldquoI can only say that voters donrsquot appreciate it, and we can see that in the polls, when we argue with each other and they donrsquot even understand what about, Mrs Merkel said last weekend as she reviewed the year since Germanyrsquos last national election.In that vote, all three governing parties lost signicant support and Alternative for Germany entered the national parliament.The CSU, with its eyes firmly on the Baian election, doubled down on tough talk about migration.That has ided Mrs Merkel and Mr Seehofer since , when he assailed her decision to leave Germanyrsquos borders open as refugees and others crossed the Balkans.Mr Seehofer triggered the most serious crisis yet in Mrs Merkelrsquos fourth-term government, when the pair sparred in June over whether to turn back small numbers of asylum-seekers at the German-Austrian border.The argument briefly threatened to bring down the administration and end his partyrsquos alliance with Mrs Merkelrsquos.He played a starring role in a second crisis last month, doggedly backing the head of Germanyrsquos domestic intelligence agency amid demands that he be removed for appearing to downplay recent far-right violence against migrants.Mrs Merkelrsquos governing coalition needed two attempts to reach a compromise.Mr Seehoferrsquos tactics have started annoying even conservatives who support his positions.Speculation is re that party leader Horst Seehofer, Germanyrsquos interior minister, could be forced out Volker Bouffier, a conservative seeking re-election as governor of neighbouring Hesse state in an October  election, remarked recently the -year-old CSU leader has performed ldquooutstanding services, but he has a tendency to make lone, surprising decisions.Mr Soeder, the new governor, has switched from even tougher talk on migration than Mr Seehofer to trying to project an inclusive image as Baian leader.Polls suggest the switch has not been convincing.They put support for the CSU as low as % mdash down from .% in , in an election held at the height of Mrs Merkelrsquos popularity when Mr Seehofer regained the absolute majority it lost five years earlier.Alternative for Germany did not field candidates then, but looks set to win % or more this time.The Greens are running second, with support of up to %, and the Social Democrats mdash struggling badly in national polls mdash could lose nearly half of the .% they won five years ago.Such a result would leave the CSU seeking either an ideologically dficult coalition with the left-leaning Greens or an alliance with one or more of the pro-business Free Democrats, the centre-right Free Voters and the Social Democrats.A four-way coalition without the CSU might be mathematically possible, but is unlikely.Mr Soeder has blamed ldquopolitics in Berlin for poor ratings in Baia with Mr Seehofer already insisting he will stay in his job after the election.And Mrs Merkel, her authority already weakened by the government infighting and the ouster of a close ally as her partyrsquos parliamentary leader, will be hoping poor election results in Baia and Hesse do not create new problems before a party convention in December where her leadership is due for renewal.The

and heard directly about their concerns.I have also contacted Argyll and Bute Council#s planning department numerous times, and, on September , I spoke with James Macintyre of Macleod Construction and made my views very clear on this matter.The potential new G pitch and footpath are much needed and more than welcome.That said there have clearly been large failings in the consultation process and this must not happen in future.In order to find the best way forward MacLeods will need to move rugby posts to new positions, using new sleeves and with an Islay Rugby presence during the operation.Leveling off of the west side of the pitch must be carried out using good soil with a view to extending the level pitch by several meters.Material for a ryelock fence should be provided by MacLeods and or others, and permissions given for construction of a standard fence.This fence should run between the timber fence at the rear of the housing estate and the timber fence at the car park, in a line running along the pitch side edge of the new path across the rugby pitch.This should make the extended area as near dog-free as possible and solve the serious fouling problem which unfortunately continues to exist.Regardless of how many of my fellow Ileachs feel, about where this pathway has been built and the lack of proper communication, the hard working front line workers, of Macleods are only following orders and any hostility directed towards them is unhelpful and unfair.If these changes and additions to the building works are made all parties will be happy and Islay will have a terric rugby pitch.Bowmore locals will have a new foot path and Islay can hopefully look forward to the prospect of a wonderful new G pitch in the future.Despite the upset caused by this

Ms Viguier and a team of Edinburgh stitchers crafted a complete replica of the Marian hangings which can be seen at Edinburgh Castle.The Battle of Pinkie Cleugh tapestry will take the form of a series of embroideries hung on velvet which, it is hoped, will find a permanent home at The Brunton in Musselburgh.The Pinkie Cleugh Battlefield Group has already secured pound, from the Musselburgh Common Good Fund, which will pay for the first phase of the tapestry.

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere. Or perhaps there is a crowd of them.The hope is that once my son is a teenage lad himself, he will be able to sit on the Girdle Rocks with Johnny Moat and tell the legend."},{"url":null,"title":"group-objects-to-750-new-homes-at-windygoul-south","story":"A planning application for the site was submitted last month by Walker Group Ltd.The site plan extends Windygoul South to the Charles River Research Institute and Carlaverock Farm.But at a TECC meeting, members voiced their concerns over the proposals.Robert McNeill, community councillor, told the meeting: ldquoIn all my years on the community council, I canrsquot recall us making a formal objection about any developments in Tranent.ldquoWe try to be very proactive to any problems and find a solution.

Enough is enough. The community canrsquot take it any longer.David Forrest, TECC chairman, shared these concerns, pointing out the lack of infrastructure as the main reason for objecting to the plans.He said: ldquoGrounds for an objection has to be that the infrastructure in Tranent couldnrsquot cope with another  houses on the south side of Tranent.ldquoAll that traffic would be travelling through the centre, whether itrsquos to get to Edinburgh or just to go shopping.ldquoTranent is unique, traffic-wise, in East Lothian.

suggest Baiarsquos centre-right Christian Social Union party , which has run the region for  years, is heading for its worst performance since the s on Sunday.It appears to be losing voters on both the right and left despite enviable prosperity and unemployment at a rock bottom .%.The CSU, which is socially conservative and has taken a hard line on migration, exists only in Baia and is an important but often awkward sister to Mrs Merkelrsquos Christian Democratic Union .The two parties govern Germany in an infighting-prone coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats.Though the CSU is unlikely to lose power in Baia altogether, a result like the one pollsters are forecasting would be humiliating.Speculation is re that party leader Horst Seehofer, Germanyrsquos interior minister, could be forced out.ldquoThe CSU has lost its cohesive power in Baia mdash it was able to win over voters from the right to the centre-left, said Manfred Guellner, the head of the Forsa polling agency.ldquoNow, because of its confrontational course with its sister party, with the chancellor, it has driven away the liberal centre.On the other side, the far-right Alternative for Germany is appealing to voters looking for an uncompromising anti-migration and law-and-order stance.About . million people are eligible to vote in the election for the state legislature in Munich.For decades, the CSU attracted voters from across the spectrum, standing for a combination of modernity and tradition encapsulated by the slogan ldquoLaptops and Lederhosen.It has held an absolute majority in the state legislature for all but five of the last  years and prides itself on punching above its weight in national politics.Lately, that tradition has been evident largely in battles over migration between Mr Seehofer and Mrs Merkel.Mr Seehofer joined Mrs Merkelrsquos Cabinet in March after giving up his job as Baiarsquos governor to younger rival Markus Soeder following a long-running CSU power struggle.ldquoI can only say that voters donrsquot appreciate it, and we can see that in the polls, when we argue with each other and they donrsquot even understand what about, Mrs Merkel said last weekend as she reviewed the year since Germanyrsquos last national election.In that vote, all three governing parties lost signicant support and Alternative for Germany entered the national parliament.The CSU, with its eyes firmly on the Baian election, doubled down on tough talk about migration.That has ided Mrs Merkel and Mr Seehofer since , when he assailed her decision to leave Germanyrsquos borders open as refugees and others crossed the Balkans.Mr Seehofer triggered the most serious crisis yet in Mrs Merkelrsquos fourth-term government, when the pair sparred in June over whether to turn back small numbers of asylum-seekers at the German-Austrian border.The argument briefly threatened to bring down the administration and end his partyrsquos alliance with Mrs Merkelrsquos.He played a starring role in a second crisis last month, doggedly backing the head of Germanyrsquos domestic intelligence agency amid demands that he be removed for appearing to downplay recent far-right violence against migrants.Mrs Merkelrsquos governing coalition needed two attempts to reach a compromise.Mr Seehoferrsquos tactics have started annoying even conservatives who support his positions.Volker Bouffier, a conservative seeking re-election as governor of neighbouring Hesse state in an October  election, remarked recently the -year-old CSU leader has performed ldquooutstanding services, but he has a tendency to make lone, surprising decisions.Mr Soeder, the new governor, has switched from even tougher talk on migration than Mr Seehofer to trying to project an inclusive image as Baian leader.Polls suggest the switch has not been convincing.They put support for the CSU as low as % mdash down from .% in , in an election held at the height of Mrs Merkelrsquos popularity when Mr Seehofer regained the absolute majority it lost five years earlier.Alternative for Germany did not field candidates then, but looks set to win % or more this time.The Greens are running second, with support of up to %, and the Social Democrats mdash struggling badly in national polls mdash could lose nearly half of the .% they won five years ago.Such a result would leave the CSU seeking either an ideologically dficult coalition with the left-leaning Greens or an alliance with one or more of the pro-business Free Democrats, the centre-right Free Voters and the Social Democrats.A four-way coalition without the CSU might be mathematically possible, but is unlikely.Mr Soeder has blamed ldquopolitics in Berlin for poor ratings in Baia with Mr Seehofer already insisting he will stay in his job after the election.And Mrs Merkel, her authority already weakened by the government infighting and the ouster of a close ally as her partyrsquos parliamentary leader, will be hoping poor election results in Baia and Hesse do not create new problems before a party convention in December where her leadership is due for renewal.The government must ldquobetter present its actions, she said Saturday, adding: ldquoI want to make my contribution to that."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource

So they are paying over the odds to heat their home.ldquoPeople are in this situation for a iety of reasons. In some cases electricity is the only source available, as gas supply pipes donrsquot reach their home. In other cases they are renting their home so have to accept whatever system the landlord has installed.ldquoThe good news is that there are some excellent support services out there, but they are not reaching everyone who needs them. So we need to make sure that electricity users know they can access specialist support that is tailored to their needs.A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoOver the letime of this parliament we are investing over half a billion pounds to tackle energy efficiency and fuel poverty, and we are taking forward landmark legislation to eradicate fuel poverty for good. We want to see a Scotland where everyone lives in a warm, energy efficient home, and has access to affordable, low carbon energy.ldquoOur Draft Fuel Poverty Strategy sets out how we will drive progress towards meeting the ambitious targets in the Fuel Poverty Bill we introduced to Parliament this year. This legislation, our long term Strategy and our Energy Efficient Scotland Programme will place Scotland among the best in the world in terms of tackling fuel poverty and reducing carbon emissions from our buildings.* MSPs have called on the public to air their views on planned legislation to set a new legal target to reduce fuel poverty.The Fuel Poverty Bill sets a target to have no more than % of households living in fuel poverty by .A previous target set by the Scottish Executive in  to eradicate fuel poverty by  was missed.The planned legislation sets out a new definition which calculates the proportion of household income needed for acceptable heating and assesses the extent to which households can then maintain an ldquoacceptable standard of living once housing and fuel costs are deducted.Applying the new definition to  data, the rate currently stands at %.Holyroodrsquos Local Government and Communities Committee is seeking views from the public on the planned legislation, includingpeople agree with the new target and the revised definition andlessons have been learned from previous initiatives."},{"url":null,"title":"keep-it-in-the-family-the-500m-fish-quotas-carve-up","story":"According to the study, the families control  per cent of the allocated catch and land the poundm annual quota of pelagic fish using just  boats.The environmental campaign group Greenpeace, which carried out the investigation, is now urging the government to give more quotas to smaller-scale, local fishermen whose activities have a lower impact on the environment, benefiting coastal communities and marine wildle.Research by Greenpeace shows that much of the quota allocated to the UK by Brussels under the European Common Fisheries Policy is concentrated in the hands of a small number of industrial fishing companies.While small-scale fishing vessels make up four-fths of the fleet, they have just % of the available quota.The investigation into the fishing sector has mapped out the ownership and distribution of the fishing quota across the entire UK for the first time.It found that, in Scotland, five wealthy families own or control one thirdof the entire Scottish quota.But when taking into account minority stakes, companies wholly or partly owned by these families hold close to halfof the Scottish quota.Charles Millar, executive director of Sustainable Inshore Fisheries Trust, said: ldquoThe misallocation of fish quotas in Scotlandrsquos fishery, as unearthed by Greenpeace, is now plain to see.ldquoThe vast majority of the fleet have almost no quota to work with while a handful of multi-millionaires hold enough to make them even richer.ldquoThe Scottish Government urgently needs to alter the way that Scotlandrsquos quota is allocated so that access to our publicly owned fish stocks is fairly distributed among local, low-impact, fishers right around our coastline.\"The largest quota owner is Alexander Buchan and his family, who have run up an estimated net worth of poundm through their Peterhead-based Lunar Fishing Company which owns the largest stake of the UKrsquos quota holdings at .%.The Plymouth-based company Interfish, owned by the Colam family, is the second largest quota holder, with .% of the UK total, and they have an estimated wealth of poundm.Fraserburgh-based Robert Tait and familyrsquos Klondyke Fishing Company is the UKrsquos third-largest quota holder, with .% of the total, and they are worth an estimated poundm.Hull-based Andrew Marr and family are worth an estimated poundm and control .% of UK quota holdings.Sir Ian Woodrsquos fishing business, JW Holdings, holds % of the UKrsquos fishing quota and has minority investments in businesses partnerships that hold a further .%.The right to fish dferent species is regulated by the government, which hands out quotas to groups of companies and fishermen known as producer organisations.While these groups are intended to work like co-operatives, the investigation has revealed a handful of people instead control huge swathes of the UK coast. The investigation also found just three companies own more than half of Englandrsquos quota while some fishermen hoard quota on vessels which never cast a net.Nearly half of England and Walesrsquo quota is held by companies based outside the those countries, despite reforms to the EUrsquos fisheries policy which encourage national governments to allocate fishing quota on social and environmental grounds.It is claimed that the ownership of quota by large-scale fishing firms also poses greater risk to the environment and fish stocksmore destructive fishing practices are deployed, an allegation strenuously denied by the families themselves.Scottish Greens environment spokesman Mark Ruskell MSP said: ldquoThis investigation should serve as a reminder that much of Scotlandrsquos fishing industry is in the grip of a handful of very rich people ... , many of them putting profit before science, happy to wipe the seas clean rather than manage stocks sustainably so we have food for the future.ldquoFishing industry voices have actively encouraged the kind of deregulated free-for-all the Toriesrsquo Brexit crisis is dragging us toward, posing massive risks to jobs and public services in our coastal communities.  per cent of whatrsquos caught in Scottish waters is sold to the EU so the isolationism of Brexit will ruin our export economy.ldquoIf we want a future for fisheries we need to distribute quotas to more local and sustainable operators. Itrsquos an agenda that so far neither the SNP nor the Tories have shown any interest in but Greens will continue to push forward.Scottish Fishermanrsquos Federation chief executive Bertie Armstrong said: ldquoOnce again, Greenpeace is guilty of painting a completely  picture of the UK fishing industry to match its particular prejudices.ldquoSustainability has for many years been the number one priority for the industry, and many sacrices have been made to reach the present position where for key stocks catches are at record or near record high levels while pressure on those stocks from fishing vessels is at a record low, as testied by recent academic study.ldquoStudies also show that for pelagic species large vessels which require massive capital investment are signicantly more environmentally friendly than a fleet of smaller vessels, not to mention safer in wild offshore winter seas where and when much of the catching of this type takes place.ldquoThe only thing that has eroded our coastal communities is a blatantly inequitable EU Common Fisheries Policy which awards other fishing nations  per cent of our fish stocks.ldquoInstead of focusing on the events of well over a decade ago to carry out a hatchet job, Greenpeace should be crediting the industry for its forward thinking approach."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-theresa-mays-end-to-austerity-pledge-big-tory-con-if-public-sector-spending-not-increased","story":"The Labour leader eschewed the subject of Brexit and concentrated his fire at PMQs on austerity, pressing the Prime Minister on how she planned to end the funding squeeze on the police, the NHS, schools, councils and disabled people following her unexpected party conference vow.But Mrs May hit back, claiming Labours plans would cost people pound trillion and, after all the countryrsquos hard work, thrust it back to square one.She repeated her pledge to end austerity and told MPs: \"What is not being brought to an end is fiscal responsibility.\"During sharp exchanges and after the PM raised her Governmentrsquos actions on tackling the issue of mental health, Mr Corbyn pointed to cuts to mental health budgets, the police and other areas as he asked when would austerity finally be over.\"Today there are , fewer mental health nurses than there were in .

The huge sums have been made by large-scale fishermen, with five wealthy families controlling one-third of Scotlandrsquos total quota, despite the entire pelagic fleet consisting of just  vessels.But for those outside the big companies, fishing is becoming a less and less profitable pursuit due to a quota system that favours larger enterprises over small vessels.A study by Greenpeacersquos investigative unit claims to reveal a vastly unequal system where a minority of wealthy families control huge swathes of fishing rights to the detriment of local fishermen.In desperation, many small scale fishermen resort to contacting larger outfits, or those they know have Fixed Quota Allocationsthat they do not fish. Those owners can set their own prices and lease out quota, allowing the fisherman to catch more.The prices set for leasing out FQA can y by hundreds of pounds. To lease a tonne of cod for example, can cost from pound to pound. The resulting catch might bring just pound, at market, meaning a profit margin of pound before staff and equipment costs.According to Greenpeace, the situation has left some fishermen going out on boats alone because they cannot afford to pay a crew, while others have found that, after boat costs, they are still losing money and have stopped fishing altogether.Jerry Percy, founder of the Under Ten Fishermenrsquos Association, which represents small scale fishermen, said: ldquoThe fish in our seas are a public resource, itrsquos yours and mine, managed by Government on our behalf. They should therefore never be treated as just another commodity, to be bought and sold to the highest bidder.ldquoThe hoarding of quota risks creating a distorted market in which the price of fish stocks, and access to them, is controlled by just a few companies.The problem, say critics, dates back to the s when economists argued that the problem of diminishing fish stocks brought about by fleet expansion and mass industrialisation should be solved by the market. They proposed that states create a limited right to catch fish that could be bought and sold.Iceland was one of the first countries to implement this market-based policy in the Eighties. Their fish stocks began to recover and the fishing fleet grew more profitable. But the privatisation of once common fishing-rights led to many fishermen becoming dispossessed as banks started trading in fishing rights and the system eventually crashed.In the UK, the price of large fishing boats and their associated right-to-fish has rocketed, which has led to many young people being priced out. In many cases only large companies with the backing of banks can buy boats.Greenpeace hope the UK can succeed where Iceland failed, and rein in the market to create a fairer system.Will McCallum, head of oceans at Greenpeace UK, said: ldquoHow long before the Government stops blaming other countries, looks at its own broken system, accepts responsibility for fixing it and creates a fairer and more sustainable distribution of fishing quota across the UK  With the Fisheries Bill rumoured to be just weeks away, there has never been a better opportunity to do just this.Sinclair Banks of Lunar Fishing said: ldquoThe quota available to the inshore fleetis more than the under-m fleet can catch, so there is no merit in the suggestion that there is disadvantage to the lsquosmall-scale fishermenrsquo.ldquoIn fact the vast majority of fish caught requires larger vessels to catch because of location, depth and weather challenges. It would be impossible for the inshore fleet to catch a small percentage of the quota.ldquoIn relation to workforce, Lunar uses the quota to employ around  people in the local communities of Peterhead, Fraserburgh and Aberdeen. Many more are employed in providing services to the company.A spokesman for Sir Ian Woodrsquos arm, the Don Fishing Co and JW Holdings, said: ldquoBoth come from strong fish catching backgrounds with Sir Ian Woodrsquos father, grandfather and great grandfather all being fishermen. The Don operates as a management and fish selling company working on behalf of about  vessels in which it has mainly minority shares and another  vessels which it helps manage and sell the fish. The Don Corsquos one and only reason for owning some quota itself and helping a large number of fishing vessels to buy their own quota is to enable the vessels to have sufficient quota to be viable.A spokesman for Andrew Marr International said: ldquoAMI fully supports robust fishery management including full compliance to protect fish stocks and sustainable fishing. AMI has  vessels in the English Fully Documented Fishery Scheme with on board camera monitoring.ldquoThe main stocks that AMI fishes for in the North Sea are cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, monkfish. In these species, the Under  fleet have excess quota that they have not used in the last several years.A spokesman for Interfish said: ldquoAcross our fleet we were the first UK fleet to achieve full certication against the Responsible Fishing Scheme in  and maintained this against the new standard in  ndash no other fleet of skippers have achieved this standard.ldquoInterfish are active within several MSC client groups enabling sustainable certication of offshore and inshore fisheries."},{"url":null,"title":"brian-beacom-can-the-new-bbc-scotland-channel-make-scotland-happy","story":"What you do therefore is grab your audience where you can, when you can.

Or rather we would have had we realised it might actually be delivered. What we have screamed out for these past years is a Scottish Six news programme and what happened is the BBC has wrapped a tartan scarf around the loudest mouths in Natland by offering a whole new channel. We wanted tea and scones. Wersquove got a full three courses. But are we going to enjoy whatrsquos on offer Initial signs are positive. Steve Carson is the man charged with BBC Scotland output, as Head of Multi Commissioning. His television CV suggests hersquos -years -old. . Which all looks great.And he says all the right things. ldquoThe plan for the new channel is to reflect Scotland right back at itself. Now, thatrsquos a toughie, Steve, because Scotland has a history of covering up one eye while looking in the mirror. And the one open eye is a little bloodshot and blurry.We love to see ourselves as a fun-loving, happy collective. The reality is Scotland is ided on so many levels how it sees its future, the importance it places on its past. Scotlandrsquos class ide isnrsquot quite the size of the Nevis range, but itrsquos vast. We live in a little tribal country thatrsquos so often sectarian and loves to get upset with itself.

Sounds smashing. The new station will be multi- ndash connected to iPlayer, Radio Scotland, social media and other services. More than  production companies will deliver content. But what sort of content  Much of the target audience will be -, which represents a real challenge. How do you entice young people away from Netflix, YouTubing, wearing their thumbs out on their phones  Well, according to Carsons crew, programmes fronted by the likes of rapper writer Darren McGarvey could make a real mark, his political voice offering up an alternative tour of Scotland.The very funny Grado will front a quiz show and the Peoplersquos News will take in the publicrsquos filmed response to news and topical events. Therersquos also Meet Jamie Genevieve, featuring the YouTube ldquobeauty guru . Given the taster we watched it seems your Auntie Cissie in Kilsyth will find shows such as this a less natural fit than she would a nose ring and ripped jeans.Yet, the new channel isnrsquot ignoring those who prefer TV to be about people rather than what people put on their faces. Documentaries planned include Last Breath, which features the tale of the North Sea er stranded on the seabed with only five minutes of oxygen left. The agedwill sink into this human drama, which incorporates actual footage with the drama.Yes, BBC Scotland would be mad not to spread bet its poundm budget. Thatrsquos why the new channel will let you see River City and Scot Squad before it appears on big BBC.And of course, therersquos the much-demanded news programme. It wonrsquot go out at six, but at nine. And it will have a ldquonew fresh format, although detail of that is to be announced. What we do know however it that it will run for an hour, fronted by Martin Geissler and Rebecca Curran. I donrsquot know Rebecca Curran but Martin Guissler is smarter than a schoolboy at the start of a new term. It sounds exciting.There are also plans under way to broadcast from Scottish theatres, which hasnrsquot been done since . And sport will be covered with discussion forums. But herersquos a little mump wouldnrsquot the new channel be the perfect  for an arts programme, discussing that weekrsquos hi-brow less hi-brow output in Scotland  It could be lively and fun.The world of Scottish theatre alone offers up regular opportunity for strong opinion .It will certainly be fascinating to seeBBC Scotland can get close to its hoped-for  per cent share, to broadcast to as wide as possible demographic, to capture zeitgeist, to reflect Scotland right back at itself, in the way that STV did in  or Radio Clyde in .Interestingly, Gradorsquos Test Drive could be a metaphor for the new channel a car-driving couple progress to their destinationthey answer a series of questions correctly pitched at them by the sat nav.

In fact, with a greater number of people living with and after a cancer diagnosis, the need for wellbeing support and information services is likely to continue to rise.“Thanks to the support of Hydrasun, we aim to reach even more people who can benefit from our support.

I am grateful to Andy Moir once again for making himself available and to all those we met in Stronsay, who engaged constructively and put forward a number of issues for further consideration.“The key issue raised at the public meeting was undoubtedly the decision by NHS Orkney not to include a helipad on the site of the new Balfour hospital. Concerns were expressed about apparent delays in transferring Isles patients, brought in by air ambulance, from Kirkwall airport to the current Balfour due to a lack of land ambulance capacity.“While it is unlikely that NHS Orkney will reopen the decision on a helipad, ious suggestions were made about how delays in transfer to the hospital might be avoided in future. Mr Moir agreed to take these up with his colleagues responsible for land ambulance provision. Hopefully this may enable greater resilience to be built into the service going forward.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This includes travel costs to attend training or to compete on the Scottish mainland, which he believes can be prohibitive.#Grants and sponsorship are available and invaluable, but finding ways to reduce costs remains a challenge,# he explained.“I was also told that for some girls and women, the macho image associated with certain sports can be a disincentive to get involved. In that respect, having good female role models is important and in Orkney we are fortunate to have a great many.#The success of Anna Tait and Rachael Sutherland at the last two Orkney Sportsperson of the Year Awards illustrates this perfectly, with Anna winning from an all-female shortlist that also included Sarah MacPhail and Hannah Beavan, and Amy Golder taking the top junior award. Meanwhile, Orkney Dragons go from strength to strength, attracting more girls and women into playing rugby.Increasing participation is something that Mr McArthur feels we should all be able to support.#Role models are part of that, but we need to look at ways of removing obstacles, whether that be to do with funding, facilities or even, as Anna Tait suggested, making the image of a sportswoman more acceptable to young girls.“When you see those inspirational people within your own community, it’s so much easier to say ‘well why not me #copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This consultation is a great opportunity for older Orcadians’ comments and experiences to help shape future planning for more inclusive, affordable and accessible transport on our islands.”Speaking about the workshop, Age Scotland’s Policy Engagement  Campaigns Officer Simon Ritchie said: “We know that a lack of transport options can be a huge barrier for many older people in the Highlands and Islands living the le they want to live. Around , older people in Scotland don’t see anyone  for at least half a week so easy access to good transport options is vital to older people allowing them to run errands, meet friends and family, make medical appointments and improve their quality of le.#This is a brilliant opportunity for older people in Orkney to share their views on transport and shape the new National Transport Strategy.  Age Scotland and Transport Scotland want to hear how transport works for older Orcadians so that decision-makers can ensure older Orcadians can access the services they need in order to enjoy later le.#“We invite any and all older people in Orkney to come along and share their views with us.”The transport workshop will take place in Finstown on Thursday October  at the Orkney Men#s Shed.

The other sites being considered for the initial roll-out include Glasgow, Ayr, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Fort William, Milngavie, Oban, Inverness and Aberdeen.The units will be fitted with technology that will enable them to digitally track water usage at each Top-up point, transmitting the data via cloud technology to specialists managing Scotland’s water networks. The resulting data will be used to calculate cost and plastic savings, along with the volume of water being consumed.Douglas Millican, Scottish Water chief executive, said: “Our research shows that people feel very positively towards the quality of Scotland’s tap water — now these state-of-the-art taps can provide access to enable water drinkers to enjoy it while on the go by carrying and using refillable bottles.”The Your Water, Your Le campaign aims to make tap the first choice for water drinkers wherever they are, and encourages businesses to make it readily available for staff and customers.

She called for the creation of prearranged collections for businesses seeking to deposit large amounts of cash, after the review recognised that such arrangements could be improved.The MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch said: \"As the MSP for Beauly and Kyle, I am of course disappointed that the RBS branches in both towns are to close.\"While I recognise branch use has been declining in both of these areas, there are still well-documented and legitimate questions regarding security and disabled access in the alternative banking provision.\"The review plainly states that the branch closure in Beauly will cause dficulties for vulnerable customers and so as the constituency MSP I am calling on RBS to work with me to put measures in place to provide specic support for them. I hope RBS will work with me to listen to the views of the community council to ensure there are better routes and provision in the Beauly area.\"The union Unite slated the announcement by RBS, arguing that the bank had simply gone through the motions of reviewing the cases before pushing ahead with its original plans.The unionrsquos regional officer, Lyn Turner, said: \"The Johnston Carmichael review was entirely predictable and nothing but a rubber-stamp of RBS management decisions.

A provisional thumbs up had been given by the CMA at the end of August.SSE welcomed the decision to give the merger the green light, which will create the UK’s second biggest energy supplier after British Scottish Gas.Under the deal, the new company will be listed on the London Stock Exchange with SSE shareholders holding . per cent and Npower owner Innogy holding . per cent. The merged group will serve some . million customers.Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of SSE, said: “This is a complex transaction and there is still much work to do in the coming weeks and months.“However, we’ve always believed that the creation of a new, independent energy and services retailer has potential to deliver real benefits for customers and the market as a whole and it is good to see that the CMA has cleared the transaction following what was a comprehensive and rigorous inquiry.”The CMA had launched a full inquiry into the merger after its initial investigation found that the tie-up could reduce competition, potentially leading to higher prices for households.The regulator added that the incoming UK government-enforced price cap would also help protect customers on iable deals. Anne Lambert, chair of the CMA inquiry group, said: “With many energy companies out there, people switching away from expensive standard iable tarfs will still have plenty of choice when they shop around after this merger.“But we know that the energy market still isn’t working well for many people who don’t switch, so we looked carefully at how the merger would affect SVT prices.“Following a thorough investigation and consultation, we are confident that SSE and Npower are not close rivals for these customers and so the deal will not change how they set SVT prices.”Victoria Arrington at comparison site Energyhelpline said: “Even with the SSE-Npower merger going ahead, the energy market is still large and ied.“A competitive market with lots of quality players is what can help keep energy prices low for consumers.“With more than  suppliers to choose from, consumers have loads of opportunities to seek out a great energy deal,” she added.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David. Your warning shots make me feel that I should grabfew bottles of whisky 🥃 go back to bed and snooze my way through the day even though there’s a hot Indian summer outside.!!Seriously , weare facing a dire situation which will impact on my grandsons far more than on me —— or you. When you say ‘Agriculture’ I’m assuming that you are including livestock.The greenhouse gas emissions from the planet’s animal le must be enormous and that’s whether or not they are raised for their meat .Also, to take your point, such vast amounts of money are tied into food production , it’s hard to seeany measures at all, however well intentioned, , will enable us to eradicate the decline of le in its widest sense.Time to grab that whisky bottle I think 🤔. Cheers.Is there going to be a remake of #Dad#s Army#  Only, a number of contributors seem to be vying for the part of Private Fraser: #Wur do-oO-MM-ED!# LOL 🙂# You stupid Boy, Pike##.sorry, John # lolI take your points Haydn and Ian, but according to predicted human population expansion, it is estimated the global population will be around  billion by the year  Other dynamics affecting population growth, as you know, is requiring more land not only for agriculture but for accommodation and expanded space for for other amenities related.Not doubt, I think, there may come a critical point where demand for the expansion of the population, not including technological advancement, will determine how we live and finding a balance between our own demands to this of the natural world and other le The driving force for this expansion is predominantly based on economics and technological advances, and as long as this is the precedent, this could bring into conflict what we want and what nature will will allow In the food chain, I suspect we will become more use to # processed food # as technological progress will find better ways of growing alternative foods, whether biologically or chemically, as an answer to keep a balance between our demands and this of a coexisting relationship with the natural laws which govern le itself, including humans.You are quite right John, there are people who seem to be dominating these columns and I fear that I am a guilty one —— as well as the others.Perhaps I should take a break and ease off.The trouble is, there are interesting and important problems out there which should be aired rather than be allowed to fester.Maybe a bit more humour would help to make the rough stuff a little more palatable.So, step forward anyone of a Dad’s Army disposition !!

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is.

But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League.

Added to this, a further four football pitches worth of the reserve land would be temporarily lost to the construction site to accommodate the construction activities and the associated diggers, cranes and other heavy machinery.\"But the effects of the road scheme on the reserves wildle will extend far beyond the extent of roadworks activities.\"The noise and activity associated with the A construction works, and the increased traffic flows and the imposing road structure once the road is completed, will cause many birds to keep their distance and not attempt to nest or feed within several hundred metres of the road site.\"Transport Scotland has bought land at Dellmore near Insh Marshes and proposes to convert some of this to wet grassland to accommodate the homeless wader bird species from Insh. While RSPB Scotland has welcomed this, the charity said it will be hard to convert this land for the waders, and maintain it as such over the long-term.The spokeswoman said: \"It is far from guaranteed it will provide suitable habitat, and evenit does, the new habitat will not be big enough or suitable to rehome all of the waders that would be made homeless. Neither will it address other harm to wildle.\"Karen Birkby, RSPB Scotlands site manager at Insh Marshes, said several suggestions made to Transport Scotland to minimise impact on the nature reserve have been ignored.Aviemore Community Council made similar claims last week that their concerns had fallen on stoney ground over plans to construction the dual carriageway on the village side of the current A as part of the Dalraddy-Slochd section. They said it will impact on the popular Milton Woods.Ms Birkby said: \"We have continually made the case for protecting the exceptional wildle of Insh Marshes, minimising harmful impacts, and maximising environmental benefits such as enhancing or providing suitable new habitat nearby.\"While we welcome the intention of converting some land at Dellmore to wet grassland, it is far from guaranteed that it will provide suitable habitat for all the wildle affected.\"We understand the need for the A dualling but believe that it can be built in a way which minimises its impact.\"We have suggested several ways in which Transport Scotland could do this but disappointingly, they are not proposing these measures in the latest plans, so there is a real risk that the road scheme will result in long-term harm to a iety of wildle.\"We encourage local people to view the proposals online or attend the public exhibition and raise their concerns before the deadline of October .\"The proposals for Crubenmore to Kincraig went on show yesterday in Newtonmore Village Hall.

Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week.

It would involved taking passengers by bus from Strathcarron to stations along the line to Kyle of Lochalsh.At the moment, even when a train has gone passed the bypass, that section of line must remain closed until the train reaches either Kyle or Strathcarron. Mr Howell said that Transport Scotland and Transport Minister Michael Matheson are considering this.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said Scotrail are looking at the proposal, which will have to be approved by the Mr Matheson. to facilitate the essential works on the Council’s A road.“We appreciate that, notwithstanding this cooperation, there is disruption for road uses during the passage of the normal train service. We have asked colleagues in the ScotRail Alliance to considerthere are any practical options further to minimise disruption to road users during the road works whilst still maintaining services upon which rail passengers depend.”Skye and Lochalsh MP Ian Blackford supported the introduction to the buses from Strathcarron.He added: “Network Rail seem to be sticking their fingers in their ears over this. A number of mistakes from both the rail company and Highland Council have led to the situation that we are in now and have been for some time.”“Network Rail must stop some of the trains coming from Inverness at Strathcarron and then arrange a bus service going onto Stromeferry. That would alleviate the ridiculous waiting times that passengers travelling by road are experiencing.”“The current way of working has caused no end of problems. We have kids being stranded on buses for hours and cues over  cars deep in both directions. To be fair the council at least seem willing to listen. We now need to get all parties round the table and hammer out a plan on this as quickly as possible, the current situation cannot continue.”"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27473  ","story":" Michelle O#NeillIt also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls ”“Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society. They are not republican demands and it is long past that the British Government stopped prioritising its own selfish interests over what should be birth-rights of people they claim to represent.What is certain is that Direct Rule failed in the past and is not and never will be acceptable again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27474  ","story":" Mark MoloneyMartin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.FIANNA Fáil leader Mícheál Martin TD has confirmed that successful Fianna Fáil candidates standing in the North would take their seats in Westminster.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester.

It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home.

They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8658944.1538772078!/image/image.jpg","title":"northern

EasyJet pilot Alex Hawthorne who is originally from Waringstown Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels.    Alex began to pursue a career as a pilot when she moved to Canada They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain.    Alex with her grandparents in the cockpit “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.”\"  \"  Northern Irelands best fish and chip shop has been revealed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.   Alex giving her valedictorian speech at Oxford “A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8658944.1538772078!/image/image.jpg","title":"northern

A mother and grandmother, Cindy, who was just , has been described as an ‘inspirational’ figure both to her family, friends and those she mentored.   Cindy Greer Her son Aaron Greersaid: “My mum was the rock of the family. We all depended on her. “I think we all feel a bit lost right now. To have the person you have always depended upon taken away from you so suddenly, it is dficult to deal with. “She was the most amazing, inspirational person in my le. It is so hard to put into words what she meant to us. “This was always a happy house. I have such good memories because of mum. She brought all of us together. She has two grandchildren and loved them to pieces. The family was mum’s big love. Any excuse for a family gathering to bring us all together. Christmas dinner was always here with everyone around the table.”Her mum Joan Newell is simply heartbroken. She said she couldn’t imagine never seeing her eldest daughter Cindy again. “I just love her so much. She was always there for me and did whatever she could to make my le better.“She was such a rock in this family. She phoned me last Wednesday after she had been talking to Alan. I asked herwe would see her that night but she had a client coming and she would see me on Thursday afternoon. That was the last we spoke.“I was at a meeting in church on Wednesday night and a couple of people came in late and said there had been a terrible accident. I said ‘God help whoever it is’. Little did I know it was Cindy. I couldn’t take it in when I heard the news.”Her partner of  years Alan McIvor said she was coming from work last Wednesday and phoned him on her hands-free around pm to say she was leaving. “She asked how my day was and she was her usual cheery self.“She said to put the tea on, and I reckoned she would be home about .pm. Sadly she didn’t make it.”Her red Honda Civic had been involved in a collision with a van at around .pm.“Someone stopped at the scene and started CPR then Cindy was resuscitated by paramedics.

But the worst thing for a child is to lose a mother. There are no words good enough to describe the person my Mummy is or how I feel at this present moment. Even though her fabulous personality shone throughout every part of her and her le, I am going to miss the simple things like goodnight kisses, the constant ‘I love you millions my special girl’ and the hour long chats about our dreams. I am so so privileged to call her my mother and she made sure she gave all of us the most heart-warming special memories that will stay with us a letime.“Her smile, her laugh, her humour, her love will always be with me. I love you millions forever Mum.”Cindy’s sister Julie Newell said she was  years younger than her and for many years took on a motherly role. “That grew into a friendship, sister relationship which was amazing. She was my biggest support. She is the heart of this family. She was the boss as the oldest sister. She took all the decisions for mum and dad as their health isn’t great.”Cindy and her partner Alan had been together for  loving years. Alan firmly believes Cindy made him a better man. “She was a total and utter inspiration and has improved my le. She was just what I needed.“We met when we both worked for the First Trust Bank, although in dferent departments. We enjoyed such brilliant times together - so many things, holidays and weekends away that I have great memories of.“Over the last few days people have said to me that Cindy and I did more in the last  years than a lot of people have done in a letime.“We had outline plans for Cindy’s th birthday in a year and a half and that is something I will have to deal with.“It is absolutely devastating. She was my rock and inspiration to be a better person.” Cindy grew up in Gilford’s Barrack Hill and went to Craigavon Primary School in the town and on to Tandragee Junior High School. She then went to Banbridge Tech.Straight after school she joined the TSB Bank in Lisburn in  later moving to the Lurgan branch. She was in the Banbridge branch for a while but she spent the longest time in the TSB, or First Trust as it became known, in Portadown where she was a Mortgage Sales Advisor.In Lisburn she was a business advisor for the Wallace High School Young Enterprise Team which won the NI Heat of the competition one year.She took early retirement in  and retrained as a professional make-up artist later working for Clarins initially at Debenhams in Rushmere and most recently Boots at Sprucefield.In Cindy’s younger years she was very involved in her local Church of Ireland at Tullylish in the Girls Brigade and as a Sunday School teacher.Her partner Alan said Cindy held strong religious beliefs. Her other sister Tracy McConnell is involved in with a children’s missionary charity called Abaana based in Bangor. Through that charity, Cindy sponsored a little boy called George in Uganda.Cindy’s partner Alan said some of the family will be taking over this sponsorship and that is why the family feel it is appropriate that donations in lieu of flowers are to the Abaana charity c o Milne Funeral Services.The family have been overwhelmed by the huge support and love since Cindy passed away.Her son Aaron said the kindness of everyone has been ‘unbelievable’ with so many gts of flowers, food and cards.“We always knew mum was popular but didn’t realise just how many lives she had touched.“We now know how much she was loved by everyone around her and how much she loved us... we will always love her.”The family also want to thank the wider family circle and friends for their support and kindness, those who attended the accident scene for their assistance and medical intervention, the PSNI Liaison Officer who has been a tower of strength and support to them the ‘absolutely amazing’ hospital staff and consultants at the Royal Victoria Hospital and the funeral director for his compassion and professionalism. Cindy is the dearest partner of Alan, devoted mum of Aaron and Rachel, the cherished daughter of Joan and Richard Newell, treasured sister of Tracy and Julie, mother in law of Hannah, much loved Nanny C of Alfie and Alice.

A second officer with responsibility for Ulster-Scots, sign language and other languages has also been appointed.The posts are jointly funded by Belfast City Council and Foras Na Gaeilge.The announcement was made during an event in City Hall presenting research by Conradh Na Gaeilge and the Committee on the Administration of Justice into how the north’s  councils are complying with their obligations with regard to the Irish language.Speaking at the launch Chief Executive of Belfast City Council Suzanne Wylie said: “I am absolutely delighted to be here today to celebrate the Irish language officers scheme and to welcome our Irish Language Officer Colm Mag Uiginn.“We also have our Irish Language Pfficers from Fermanagh, Omagh, Derry and Strabane here as well.

On the one side are those who think that an orgy of union jack-waving to the strains of Land of Hope and Glory is an excellent idea on the other side are those with a titter of wit.Squinter can recall two similar Ulsterfests in his letime, both of them when he was a youngster. The most recent one was the queen’s  silver jubilee, when Britain vos celebratink der th anniversary von der coronation von Elizabeth Saxe-Coburg und Gotha. Loyal Ulster being loyal Ulster, it ended up cheering loudest and, West Belfast being West Belfast, we decided to celebrate the auspicious occasion with a non-stop summer of rioting as a result of which Squinter’s right arm remains sore to this day.The earlier one was the rather creepy and sinister ‘Ulster ’’ – a celebration of  years of partition that was held on land between Botanic Park and the Stranmillis Embankment. The idea was hatched in December  by Prime Minister Terence O’Neill: “In that yearNorthern Ireland will celebrate its th anniversary –  years of challenge and dficulty and occasional disappointment, but also  years of splendid achievement, of growing prosperity, of expanding opportunity.”By the summer of , though, when the gates opened to the public, Terry was out on his ear, having been done for by a combination of opposition by UUP hardliners to his limited programme of civil rights reforms and a series of UVF bomb attacks on Belfast’s water supply. He jacked it in in April  and in an interview a month later he revealed the depth of his passion for reform: “It is frightfully hard to explain to Protestants thatyou give Roman Catholics a good job and a good house they will live like Protestants because they will see neighbours with cars and television sets they will refuse to have eighteen children. Buta Roman Catholic is jobless and lives in the most ghastly hovel he will rear eighteen children on National Assistance. If you treat Roman Catholics with due consideration and kindness they will live like Protestants in spite of the authoritative nature of their Church.”Ulster ’ cracked on regardless, although the loss of a man so imbued with the spirit of egalitarianism must have been a crushing blow. An expectant public surged through the gates when the exhibition opened in May for a five month .Looking back at the photographic and filmic evidence that survives, it’s clear that the attractions on the site were, ah, modest, to say the least. Let’s see now… there was a big, multi-coloured plastic model of the Giant’s Causeway over the door of the main indoor space there was, um, a model of a Shorts plane hanging overhead there were fairground ridesthere was a disco with go-go girls a £m satellite was launched containing a message of peace from Ulster to any le forms who may happen across it. .By far the most exciting thing to happen during Ulster ’ was the introduction of internment, which wasn’t technically part of the show although doubtless it was wildly popular with a fair percentage of Ulster ’ attendees and organisers.The last bit of air went out of the balloon when it was finally decided that there would be no royal visit because the safety of the afore-mentioned Saxe-Coburg von Gothas could not be guaranteed.As for posterity, the BBC – normally an enthusiastic booster of Our Wee Country – reported in an article in : “The official government report did not describe it as a success and ultimately it is remembered as a bland effort in self-promotion for a state that was teetering on the brink of implosion.”Which brings us back to Gammonfest – sorry, the Festival of GB and THP. What’s that going to look like on this side of the Irish Sea border in four years time  Well, flags, of course – there’ll be plenty of those. But then there always is, so Ulster’s going to have to do a bit of thinking outside the box here. Marches – ditto. Bonfires – ditto. What about a festival, then  One with a funfair and the Giant’s Causeway and.. and.. never mind, you get the idea. We could call it Ulster ’. Or Catch .

In his evidence, which the tribunal accepted, Mr Matier recalled that when he was giving his details to a man at the premises he was asked to state his age. When he replied that he was , he was told: \"I was looking for a younger person who I could train and move upstairs.\" Mr Matier askedthere was any point in continuing the conversation, and was told: \"No, not really.\"He said: \"I had been keen to get this job, and to be told I was too old to even apply for it really shook me. \"I had been off work for a while and I was trying to get back in to work. It was disheartening and it made me angry that my application could just be dismissed in this way because of my age.\"In its finding, the tribunal acknowledged that the incident \"had the effect of signicantly discouraging the claimant\". It added: \"This had been caused entirely by the behaviour of the respondent and this behaviour was motivated by age discrimination.\"Mr Matiers claim was supported by the Equality Commission.Mary Kitson, senior legal officer at the Equality Commission, said: \"This case is an important reminder to all employers not to make generalised assumptions about people on grounds such as age, which are protected by anti-discrimination law.\"It is unlawful under the Employment Equality Age Regulations of  for any employer to discriminate on grounds of age in the arrangements they make when offering employment.\"The tribunal in its finding noted that Mr Matier \"was, in effect, given no opportunity on the grounds of his age\". Ms Kitson added: \"That goes to the heart of the case and it quite rightly caused Mr Matier major disappointment at a time when he was attempting to re-enter the workplace in very trying circumstances.\"No employer should be making assumptions about a persons ability, or suitability for training and promotion, because of their age.\"Spring  AirbrakeLtd said it was \"extremely disappointed\" with the decision and will be applying to have it reviewed.It said: \"This decision sets a very dangerous precedent for any employer defending claims of discrimination, in that the tribunal determined that the claimant was discriminated against, despite ascertaining that the evidence of the claimant was a little imprecise and vague.\"On behalf of the respondents, we will be applying to have this decision formally reviewed.\"We also intend writing to the Department for Communities seeking a review of their recruitment services. \"The respondent followed the approved process for advertising their vacancy with the Jobs and Benefits Office and strictly adhered to the procedure.\"The company said the absence of an employment appeal tribunal led to an \"imbalance\".It added: \"Should a review fail to address the shortcomings of this decision, the only avenue open to the respondent is to refer the matter to the Court of Appeal, which for any company is extremely prohibitive financially.\""},{"url":null,"title":"derry factory girls tribute scrapped after 85k in public","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

We wont be starting again from the very beginning.\"The sculpture was originally to be located at King Street in the Waterside, but that changed to Harbour Square due to planning problems, which led to a redesign of the original piece. Those issues saw initial costs spiral.The Department for Communities said the decision to halt the original project was \"disappointing\" but it could not justy investing further money in it due to financial considerations.\"Given the passage of time, the cost of completing the project would now result in a total cost of almost four times the original budget, meaning that, regrettably, the project no longer represents value for money,\" it added.\"The department and Derry City and Strabane District Council are still committed to commemorating the contribution of factory workers.\"SDLP councillor Martin Reilly said: \"The problems with the previous commission were not of councils own making and it is disappointing that they could not be resolved. \"The whole ethos behind this sculpture was to remember and celebrate the work of the generations of women who were the backbone of the regional economy for decades.

MPs were told the two main areas that need addressed are transformation of the education system and an ongoing funding shortfall.The committee heard that while progress has been made, the education system is still facing considerable financial pressures.The spending power of education budgets has fallen by £m since  , the MPs were informed.Yesterdays committee hearing was told that schools and services have faced unprecedented demands as a result of having to absorb increased costs such as pay and inflationary pressures. These have been impacted by rises in National Insurance and changes to superannuation and the ongoing increasing demands related to children and young people with special and additional needs. The committee heard that principals have reported \"intolerable strain\" caused by the deteriorating financial position placed upon them.Other key pressures raised during yesterdays committee include the increased need for early intervention to meet the growing and increasingly complex needs of children. There is also an increasing need for support to children who have additional and special educational needs.MPs were told of the need to close attainment gaps and improve the skills levels of children and young people. Speaking afterwards, Ms OConnor said there was a clear need to transform the education sector. \"This will require investment galvanising the skills and innovative thinking of the people within the sector,\" she said.\"This transformation will deliver improved value for money in the use of public funds and will enable and support school leaders to deliver improved outcomes.\"Transformation has already begun and improvements and progress has been made with school performance and investment in the schools estate through new buildings. \"To propel this further we support the identication of earmarked resources, for example a transformation investment fund to support the continued modernisation of services, skills and culture, to transform the system and to immediately support schools, children and young people and services during transformation.\""},{"url":null,"title":"psni and garda tell irish parliament of joint plans for policing border in hard brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Mr Todd appeared before the Oireachtas committee in Dublin for the first time alongside Mr Leahy in which they discussed the range of work both police forces have been putting in place. It is only the second time a PSNI officer has appeared before the sub-committee, following Sir Hugh Ordes visit in . Sinn Fein Senator Niall ODonnghaile asked the pair how damaging a hard border would be for cross-border corporation. Mr Leahy responded: \"We all know what could happen so we are planning for it, and in terms of resources and training we are looking at our infrastructure and what the implications will be. \"We are being mature about what is required aroundand we are waiting with bated breath as to where this takes us, but we are not sitting back and doing nothing.\" Mr Todd told the committee it was dficult to plan without details of the final Brexit deal. \"We have been looking at the range of work we do on a cross-border basis and looking at which pieces rely on European regulations, and trying to work outwe lost those how we would maintain what we have,\" he said. While there is no Brexit deal on the table, and with just months to go before the UK leaves the European Union, there is a growing risk of a hard border. Mr Todd said that the PSNI continues to face threats from dissident republicans and said he would be \"nervous\" of ato infrastructure at the frontier. He said: \"We would be nervous about anything that could be used as a focus to try and harness discontent and be used as some sort of quasi-legitimacy for their actions. \"It would make us uncomfortable at the notion that local community teams would want to enforce or be part of a border structure that didnt have approval of local communities.\" It has also emerged that the armed response unit in Northern Ireland, which was set up to deal with gun and kne crime, spends more than half its time in interventions with people suffering from mental health problems. \"That has been the saddest sht with which policing deals,\" Mr Todd added. Independents  Change TD Clare Daly described it as \"mind blowing\", and asked whether police in the Republic were dealing with similar issues. Mr Leahy told the committee that mental health was a factor in policing and the level of trauma that officers dealt with in the public is \"becoming really topical\". The Leinster House committee further heard about the PSNIs use of social media to reach out to the public. Mr Todd explained how the PSNI now had a social media outreach of more than , followers. \"In most towns across Northern Ireland there are more people following us on social media than have ever met a police officer,\" he added. Mr Todd said that local police were able to post updates without centralised control, but this also brought \"risks\". The committee heard that the Garda Facebook has , followers, while its Twitter account has almost half-a-million. Ms Daly, however pointed out that the PSNI had almost double the number of social media followers, and urged the Garda to \"pay attention\" to that area.

Dr McCormick said that he wasnt made aware of this, but that it should \"absolutely\" have been passed to the internal audit as well as to senior managers.Until relatively recently, he said he thought the only whistleblower was Janette OHagan who warned Deti of abuse to the scheme.\"Some knew and didnt tell. Those who knew and tried to tell us deserve credit and shame on us for not having noticed,\" he said.Yesterdays evidence also focused on an urgent submission made to the Deti Minister at the time, Jonathan Bell, in July  about the need to address cost controls.Askedthis was appropriately red-flagged, Dr McCormick said: \"No, the word urgent is not sufficient in this context.\"He said the submission took nearly two months to turn around, when it would normally have taken Mr Bell a week.\"He could be quick when he wanted to be. At one stage in September  we saw him clear  submissions in  minutes,\" he said.\"Im not sure how much they were read, he was at the other end of a phone. I have my suspicions on that.\"Mr Bell had previously said the delay was because he was not made aware of this before going on holiday that summer, or immediately when he ed.Dr McCormick said Timothy Cairns had shown a reluctance in processing the submission, but admitted there was no reason civil servants didnt raise the matter with Mr Bell directly."},{"url":null,"title":"weather northern ireland to bask in brief indian summer before hazardous winds on friday","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Of particular interest to local readers will be sections on Saul mdash the place of Patrickrsquos landing.Observing the interest of those outside Ireland on St Patrick, John began thinking seriously about his book project five years ago.He said: ldquoSt Patrick is so obviously supported across the world ndash what is it that causes that support ldquoI was brought up outside Downpatrick in Loughinisland. I assumed I knew everything about St Patrick. I wanted to see ndash what do we know about St Patrick  I wanted to go back. I wanted an anthology of peoplersquos writings throughout the centuries, build up a picture of what he was and what he means throughout our history over , years.John said some of his findings were a ldquototal surprise, such as the article by Maureen Donnelly lsquoThe Altar Stone of Saul Abbeyrsquo. This details how the altar stone on which Patrick is said to have celebrated Holy Communion ended up on a wagon owned by a man who wanted it for the doorstep of his new house at the junction of Saul Street and Scotch Street in . But the wagon overturned, the stone broke and it found its way instead to the Catholic Church in Saul.ldquoI never realised there was an altar stone of St Patrick actually in Saul chapel, John said. ldquoI went three times to try and see it. I could not get in the first time as there was a ceremony on. It took me a bit of time to find it. This is one of the earliest and possibly holiest relics in Ireland open to all to see.John said he was also ldquoblown away by a stained-glass window, lsquoPatrick Arrives in Saulrsquo, in Saul Chapel.ldquoThe three windows are designed so the three windows show one image, he explained. ldquoIt is absolutely beautul.John is the author of many books, including The Irish Christmas Book and The Unkindest Cut: A Cartoon History of Ulster -, as well as books on the Irish famine and the United Irishmen.Surrounded by sites linked to our patron saint in Downpatrick, John believes at times we ldquocanrsquot see the woods from the trees.He points to the massive success of less important sites in the south, or how such a historical location would promoted ldquoto the nth degree in the US.ldquoI think that is the challenge for people here today, he said. ldquoThere is so much scope, there really is. I think we lose the wood from the trees. So many stories, so many things to pursue.Interestingly, his research points to an attitude from some in the south of Patrick being a ldquonorthern saint. There is also, of course, the increased secularisation of Ireland.ldquoBut there are still a massive amount of people who are people of faith, John continued.ldquoWe live in an area of huge historical importance.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Andrew McCormick yesterday at the RHI Inquiry During yesterday’s hearing, Dr McCormick came under pressure to explain the repeated failures within his department and several actions where he personally should have acted more robustly in that period.Dr McCormick, one of Stormont’s most experienced mandarins, was asked about a private July  email from Dr Crawford to Mr Cairns in which he warned there would be “a massive spike” in applications to RHI and referred to “abuse” of the scheme.In another email, Dr Crawford explicitly said that “it pays producers to heat houses when their houses are empty as the rates are attractive”.Dr McCormick said he did not recall being warned about such a spike and that “wasn’t part of the discussion” at that point.He said: “It seems crystal clear from this email that Andrew Crawford understood the perverse incentive in the scheme in a way that we at that time did not. We should have [because] Janette O’Hagan had explained to us in very straightforward terms ... Andrew Crawford clearly understands it: ‘It pays producers to heat houses when their houses are empty as the rates are attractive’.“That’s a straightforward summary of the fundamental flaw in the scheme.”Referring to another of Dr Crawford’s emails, Dr McCormick said that the DUP Spad was “even clearer” in his understanding of the issue because “he explains the nature of the abuse that was at the heart of the problem”.He said: “Why neither Timothy nor Andrew came to us and said: This is what’s happening, here’s why it’s going wrong, here’s why you’ve got a sudden upturn in uptake –you’d even put that together with [finance official] Trevor Cooper’s points about suspicions about over-compensation, the opportunity for everything to fall into place and for us to realise the nature of the problem that we had and therefore to have acted urgently and to immediately fix it is an incredible lost opportunity.“I can’t see how there was not a consciousness to bring it to our attention on the part of both Andrew and Timothy.”Panel member Dame Una O’Brien asked: “Do you think it was being kept from you.”Dr McCormick said: “Yes. Well, that’s what happened. It was kept from us.”Body discovered on NI beachMotorcyclist dies following crash Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The mandarin went on: “To understand that, to know from the submission that we have a problem and we’re trying to solve the problem and not to say ‘you don’t understand your problem – here’s the real understanding’ is that not straightforwardly withholding information “It seems very, very clear to me that it is withholding information that was relevant to the submission that they both had.”Mr Cairns did, however, have some discussion with Dr McCormick’s deputy, Chris Stewart, about the issue because Mr Stewart emailed fellow officials a few days later to say that Mr Cairns “is concerned that there may be a further spike in demand”, although he did not use the phrase “massive”.And Mr Cairns has already told the inquiry that in that period he raised allegations of abuse of the scheme with Mr Stewart but that the department did not take the issue seriously.Dr McCormick was asked about multiple warnings to his officials about abuse of RHI which were ignored or dismissed. One of those warnings, a letter from boiler installer Solmatix in the summer of , alleged that some “unscrupulous” RHI claimants in the poultry sector were “actively exploiting it”.He said that should have been raised with the department’s internal auditors and others who could have investigated the allegation, but nothing appears to have been done.The department had been warned before about a failure to adequately listen to whistle-blowers and claimed that it had learnt lessons.Dr McCormick said that the evidence presented to the inquiry showed how much “noise” was being made by those contacting the department in dferent ways to make allegations of abuse or raise concerns about the scheme.He added: “Why it wasn’t heard – or whyit was heard it wasn’t acted on – I find deeply concerning.”He said that in the case of the letter from Solmatix, the source of the warning was known to the officials receiving it and therefore it would have had more weight. “The letter was also referring to ‘not possible abuse – they’re referring to ‘unscrupulous beneficiaries appearing to be actively exploiting it’.”Dr McCormick said: “It seems to me that a senior manager reading that would say: Stop everything we need to look at this we need to understand this what is going on here  “We need a very quick assessment as to whether this is spurious – is there any way in which this can be spurious  Or,there is substance, then we have to ask much more fundamental questions.“I can’t see how it can be read any other way than [as] something of a serious nature.”try catch     .               ..

Included in the top grades were twins Arianne and Enyala Banks, who both matched each otherrsquos results. The sisters achieved  A* grades and a distinction in additional mathematics each.Year  tutor, Amy Bates, said ldquoIt is a delight to see the hard work of the pupils and support given by parents and staff being rewarded with so many students achieving their potential and obtaining high grades.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Initially under the baton of Clford Bunford and later conducted by Douglas Baxter, the choir performed many of the major works of the choral repertoire and several less well known works.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

setback in german state election","story":"Polls suggest Baiarsquos centre-right Christian Social Union party , which has run the region for  years, is heading for its worst performance since the s on Sunday.It appears to be losing voters on both the right and left despite enviable prosperity and unemployment at a rock bottom .%.The CSU, which is socially conservative and has taken a hard line on migration, exists only in Baia and is an important but often awkward sister to Mrs Merkelrsquos Christian Democratic Union .The two parties govern Germany in an infighting-prone coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats.Though the CSU is unlikely to lose power in Baia altogether, a result like the one pollsters are forecasting would be humiliating.Speculation is re that party leader Horst Seehofer, Germanyrsquos interior minister, could be forced out.ldquoThe CSU has lost its cohesive power in Baia mdash it was able to win over voters from the right to the centre-left, said Manfred Guellner, the head of the Forsa polling agency.ldquoNow, because of its confrontational course with its sister party, with the chancellor, it has driven away the liberal centre.On the other side, the far-right Alternative for Germany is appealing to voters looking for an uncompromising anti-migration and law-and-order stance.About . million people are eligible to vote in the election for the state legislature in Munich.For decades, the CSU attracted voters from across the spectrum, standing for a combination of modernity and tradition encapsulated by the slogan ldquoLaptops and Lederhosen.It has held an absolute majority in the state legislature for all but five of the last  years and prides itself on punching above its weight in national politics.Lately, that tradition has been evident largely in battles over migration between Mr Seehofer and Mrs Merkel.Mr Seehofer joined Mrs Merkelrsquos Cabinet in March after giving up his job as Baiarsquos governor to younger rival Markus Soeder following a long-running CSU power struggle.ldquoI can only say that voters donrsquot appreciate it, and we can see that in the polls, when we argue with each other and they donrsquot even understand what about, Mrs Merkel said last weekend as she reviewed the year since Germanyrsquos last national election.In that vote, all three governing parties lost signicant support and Alternative for Germany entered the national parliament.The CSU, with its eyes firmly on the Baian election, doubled down on tough talk about migration.That has ided Mrs Merkel and Mr Seehofer since , when he assailed her decision to leave Germanyrsquos borders open as refugees and others crossed the Balkans.Mr Seehofer triggered the most serious crisis yet in Mrs Merkelrsquos fourth-term government, when the pair sparred in June over whether to turn back small numbers of asylum-seekers at the German-Austrian border.The argument briefly threatened to bring down the administration and end his partyrsquos alliance with Mrs Merkelrsquos.He played a starring role in a second crisis last month, doggedly backing the head of Germanyrsquos domestic intelligence agency amid demands that he be removed for appearing to downplay recent far-right violence against migrants.Mrs Merkelrsquos governing coalition needed two attempts to reach a compromise.Mr Seehoferrsquos tactics have started annoying even conservatives who support his positions.Speculation is re that party leader Horst Seehofer, Germanyrsquos interior minister, could be forced out Volker Bouffier, a conservative seeking re-election as governor of neighbouring Hesse state in an October  election, remarked recently the -year-old CSU leader has performed ldquooutstanding services, but he has a tendency to make lone, surprising decisions.Mr Soeder, the new governor, has switched from even tougher talk on migration than Mr Seehofer to trying to project an inclusive image as Baian leader.Polls suggest the switch has not been convincing.They put support for the CSU as low as % mdash down from .% in , in an election held at the height of Mrs Merkelrsquos popularity when Mr Seehofer regained the absolute majority it lost five years earlier.Alternative for Germany did not field candidates then, but looks set to win % or more this time.The Greens are running second, with support of up to %, and the Social Democrats mdash struggling badly in national polls mdash could lose nearly half of the .% they won five years ago.Such a result would leave the CSU seeking either an ideologically dficult coalition with the left-leaning Greens or an alliance with one or more of the pro-business Free Democrats, the centre-right Free Voters and the Social Democrats.A four-way coalition without the CSU might be mathematically possible, but is unlikely.Mr Soeder has blamed ldquopolitics in Berlin for poor ratings in Baia with Mr Seehofer already insisting he will stay in his job after the election.And Mrs Merkel, her authority already weakened by the government infighting and the ouster of a close ally as her partyrsquos parliamentary leader, will be hoping poor election results in Baia and Hesse do not create new problems before a party convention in December where her leadership is due for renewal.The government must ldquobetter present its actions, she said Saturday, adding: ldquoI want to make my contribution to that..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Merkel allies brace for big setback in German state election article_url   content_id   site_id

A mother and grandmother, Cindy, who was just , has been described as an ‘inspirational’ figure both to her family, friends and those she mentored.   Cindy Greer Her son Aaron Greersaid: “My mum was the rock of the family. We all depended on her. “I think we all feel a bit lost right now. To have the person you have always depended upon taken away from you so suddenly, it is dficult to deal with. “She was the most amazing, inspirational person in my le. It is so hard to put into words what she meant to us. “This was always a happy house. I have such good memories because of mum. She brought all of us together. She has two grandchildren and loved them to pieces. The family was mum’s big love. Any excuse for a family gathering to bring us all together. Christmas dinner was always here with everyone around the table.”Her mum Joan Newell is simply heartbroken. She said she couldn’t imagine never seeing her eldest daughter Cindy again. “I just love her so much. She was always there for me and did whatever she could to make my le better.“She was such a rock in this family. She phoned me last Wednesday after she had been talking to Alan. I asked herwe would see her that night but she had a client coming and she would see me on Thursday afternoon. That was the last we spoke.“I was at a meeting in church on Wednesday night and a couple of people came in late and said there had been a terrible accident. I said ‘God help whoever it is’. Little did I know it was Cindy. I couldn’t take it in when I heard the news.”Her partner of  years Alan McIvor said she was coming from work last Wednesday and phoned him on her hands-free around pm to say she was leaving. “She asked how my day was and she was her usual cheery self.“She said to put the tea on, and I reckoned she would be home about .pm. Sadly she didn’t make it.”Her red Honda Civic had been involved in a collision with a van at around .pm.“Someone stopped at the scene and started CPR then Cindy was resuscitated by paramedics. We are so grateful to them, as this allowed us as a family to spend more time with Cindy.Kneed teenager in head and kicked him on ground Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“We were all there as a family at her beside - everyone had a hand on her as she passed away at .pm on Thursday afternoon,” said Alan.Cindy’s daughter Rachel said: “Mum always said the worst thing a parent could watch was a child go before them. But the worst thing for a child is to lose a mother. There are no words good enough to describe the person my Mummy is or how I feel at this present moment. Even though her fabulous personality shone throughout every part of her and her le, I am going to miss the simple things like goodnight kisses, the constant ‘I love you millions my special girl’ and the hour long chats about our dreams. I am so so privileged to call her my mother and she made sure she gave all of us the most heart-warming special memories that will stay with us a letime.“Her smile, her laugh, her humour, her love will always be with me. I love you millions forever Mum.”Cindy’s sister Julie Newell said she was  years younger than her and for many years took on a motherly role. “That grew into a friendship, sister relationship which was amazing. She was my biggest support. She is the heart of this family. She was the boss as the oldest sister. She took all the decisions for mum and dad as their health isn’t great.”Cindy and her partner Alan had been together for  loving years. Alan firmly believes Cindy made him a better man. “She was a total and utter inspiration and has improved my le. She was just what I needed.“We met when we both worked for the First Trust Bank, although in dferent departments. We enjoyed such brilliant times together - so many things, holidays and weekends away that I have great memories of.“Over the last few days people have said to me that Cindy and I did more in the last  years than a lot of people have done in a letime.“We had outline plans for Cindy’s th birthday in a year and a half and that is something I will have to deal with.“It is absolutely devastating. She was my rock and inspiration to be a better person.” Cindy grew up in Gilford’s Barrack Hill and went to Craigavon Primary School in the town and on to Tandragee Junior High School. She then went to Banbridge Tech.Straight after school she joined the TSB Bank in Lisburn in  later moving to the Lurgan branch. She was in the Banbridge branch for a while but she spent the longest time in the TSB, or First Trust as it became known, in Portadown where she was a Mortgage Sales Advisor.In Lisburn she was a business advisor for the Wallace High School Young Enterprise Team which won the NI Heat of the competition one year.She took early retirement in  and retrained as a professional make-up artist later working for Clarins initially at Debenhams in Rushmere and most recently Boots at Sprucefield.In Cindy’s younger years she was very involved in her local Church of Ireland at Tullylish in the Girls Brigade and as a Sunday School teacher.Her partner Alan said Cindy held strong religious beliefs. Her other sister Tracy McConnell is involved in with a children’s missionary charity called Abaana based in Bangor. Through that charity, Cindy sponsored a little boy called George in Uganda.Cindy’s partner Alan said some of the family will be taking over this sponsorship and that is why the family feel it is appropriate that donations in lieu of flowers are to the Abaana charity c o Milne Funeral Services.The family have been overwhelmed by the huge support and love since Cindy passed away.Her son Aaron said the kindness of everyone has been ‘unbelievable’ with so many gts of flowers, food and cards.“We always knew mum was popular but didn’t realise just how many lives she had touched.“We now know how much she was loved by everyone around her and how much she loved us... we will always love her.”The family also want to thank the wider family circle and friends for their support and kindness, those who attended the accident scene for their assistance and medical intervention, the PSNI Liaison Officer who has been a tower of strength and support to them the ‘absolutely amazing’ hospital staff and consultants at the Royal Victoria Hospital and the funeral director for his compassion and professionalism. Cindy is the dearest partner of Alan, devoted mum of Aaron and Rachel, the cherished daughter of Joan and Richard Newell, treasured sister of Tracy and Julie, mother in law of Hannah, much loved Nanny C of Alfie and Alice.

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville. It was set up in  by Mr McConville, and carries out work for many of the world’s top cruise liners, including Star Cruises.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers.

He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.
