The girls were so heavy.\u0027Just as they were about to open an emergency fire exit a firefighter screamed at them to stop because that side of the building above was on fire. Ms Mekonnen couldn\u0027t even finish her sentence as she wonders aloud: \u0027If he hadn\u0027t… I can\u0027t believe we are alive.\u0027Ms Mahmud\u0027s husband Mohammed has admitted he often \u0027thinks back\u0027 to that night when it took them all about 15 minutes to get to the bottom floor with his elderly father, telling GetWestLondon: \u0027I thank God we got out early and we made it.\u0027He revealed that his wife\u0027s best friend and his children\u0027s friends passed away, as well as his friend\u0027s mother.He said of his friend: \u0027Me and him, we had both been in the tower since birth.\u0027He told how all their closest friends were there and how he \u0027prays\u0027 that they\u0027re going to be \u0027reunited\u0027 with them one day.             Meghan poses with women at the Al Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre in West LondonMs Mahmud wrote of her involvement with the book: \u0027Last summer, we were placed in a hotel and I had no kitchen to cook for my family.\u0027It was very emotional for me to get in the kitchen. The moment I started cooking I was in tears. I didn\u0027t know why though. I was just excited to be back in the kitchen again.\u0027Word started to spread - the mums from my son\u0027s school came along and they told their friends, too.

Pictured, the pair at a Knicks game in 1994\u0027He pursued me. That\u0027s why the relationship has worked: He\u0027s usually a meek person, and he took a big leap.\u0027She declared that she was \u0027madly in love with him\u0027 and \u0027completely attracted to him, physically and sexually.\u0027But she also claims that she \u0027came to realize how understanding he was\u0027 and that he \u0027grew on me.\u0027Soon-Yi Previn eviscerates \u0027vengeful and abusive\u0027 mother Mia...\u0027Woody Allen abused me when I was seven years old\u0027: Dylan...Share this articleLater, she recalls the moment after the pair first kissed.\u0027I think Woody liked the fact that I had chutzpah when he first kissed me and I said, \u0027I wondered how long it was going to take you to make a move,\u0027 she said.\u0027From the first kiss I was a goner and loved him.\u0027But their first friendly encounter came after she broke her ankle playing soccer in the 11th grade, she said.          Soon-Yi Previn and Woody Allen at a New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden in 2006When she got home, Allen looked at her ankle and suggested she see a doctor.After this incident, the pair began going to Knicks games together.When they began their \u0027fling,\u0027 both planned to keep it a secret and neither thought it would last.\u0027It only became a relationship really when we were thrown together because of the molestation charge,\u0027 Previn said.The comment refers to Dylan Farrow\u0027s allegations that Allen abused her in 1992 when she was seven-years-old.Allen was investigated but wasn\u0027t charged, and he has long denied inappropriately touching his adopted daughter.He faced a wave of backlash earlier this year including several prominent actors vowing not to work with him again.In a statement in January after Dylan\u0027s allegations resurfaced, Allen reiterated his denial and accused her and her family of using the Time\u0027s Up movement \u0027to repeat this discredited allegation.\u0027          Previn (pictured right, with Allen, Mia Farrow and their children in 1986) said she fell in love in 1992 with Allen, who was Farrow\u0027s boyfriend at the timeThe director is also quoted in the New York piece.\u0027I am a pariah,\u0027 he said during a lunch with the author.\u0027People think that I was Soon-Yi\u0027s father, that I raped and married my underaged, retarded daughter.\u0027He adds: \u0027We weren\u0027t thinking, My God, let\u0027s get married.\u0027Our relationship deepened as we went through the barrage of terrible accusations, and the paparazzi forced us to take walks only on my penthouse roof.\u0027Previn told the magazine that she decided to speak out now because Dylan Farrow, is, in her view, unfairly accusing her husband of sexual abusing her when she was a child.\u0027I was never interested in writing a `Mommie Dearest,\u0027 getting even with Mia - none of that,\u0027 Previn told the magazine.    Previn (pictured with Allen in 2010) said she decided to speak out now because Dylan Farrow, is, in her view, unfairly accusing her husband of sexual abusing her when she was a child\u0027But what\u0027s happened to Woody is so upsetting, so unjust. (Mia) has taken advantage of the #MeToo movement and paraded Dylan as a victim. And a whole new generation is hearing about it when they shouldn\u0027t.\u0027Previn also said she and her mother clashed soon after Farrow adopted her and that her mother many times treated her like a maid.She also said of Farrow: \u0027Mia wasn\u0027t maternal to me from the get-go.\u0027An email sent to Mia Farrow\u0027s agent Sunday night was not immediately returned.In separate statements posted on Twitter on Sunday night, Dylan Farrow and Ronan Farrow say their mother is a good parent and that the New York magazine article is inaccurate and unfair.Dylan also noted that the New York magazine piece\u0027s author, Daphne Merkin, calls herself a longtime friend of Allen\u0027s."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/18/04/5053006100000578-6178627-image-m-68_1537242698874.jpg","title":"Colin Jost Michael Che aim Roseanne Emmys","story":"    Michael Che and Colin Jost kicked off the Emmys with jokes that ranged from Roseanne Barr\u0027s canceled show to Ronan Farrow\u0027s impact on the #MeToo movement\u0027She\u0027s had a rough year,\u0027 Che added. \u0027I heard Roseanne is moving to Israel.\u0027 \u0027I mean damn, how messed up is your life you have to go to the Middle East to get peace of mind?\u0027 The hosts then mentioned Laurie Metcalfe, who received a supporting actress nomination for her work on Roseanne, to a round of applause from the audience.\u0027You know how great you have to be to get nominated for Roseanne now?\u0027 Che asked the crowd. \u0027That\u0027s like nominating a cop for a BET award, it doesn\u0027t happen - that would be weird.\u0027 The #MeToo movement was also a big part of the SNL hosts\u0027 monologue, hardly a surprise after it consumed television with the downfalls of Les Moonves, Matt Lauer, Louis CK, and Charlie Rose in the last year.\u0027You know it\u0027s an honor to be here sharing this night with the many talented and creative people who haven\u0027t been caught yet,\u0027 they joked.   \u0027This year the audience is allowed to drink in their seats...cause the one thing Hollywood needs right now are people losing their inhibitions at award functions,\u0027 Jost added.

Pictured:  The couple together on the set of Hooper in 1978              The Oscar-winning actress (pictured on Monday) has said that she is glad Reynolds, who died on September 6 aged 82 from a heart attack, is not alive to read her memoirField has said that she is glad Reynolds, who died earlier this month aged 82 from a heart attack, is not alive to read her memoir. And now that the book is out, it is clear what she meant.Field, 71, says in her memoir that her relationship with Reynolds was a replay of that with her stepfather, who sexually abused her from the when she was around six years old to 14.Field describes how being with Reynolds was \u0027exorcising something that needed to be exorcised\u0027 but she was \u0027trying to make it work this time\u0027.The actress writes that from the beginning Reynolds was presumptuous and arrogant, introducing himself as \u0027Burt Reynolds, movie star\u0027 when he called her. It was 1976 and he had asked her to star in Smokey and the Bandit she had already found fame with films like Gidget and Stay Hungry, while Reynolds was the biggest star in the world at the time, thanks to films like Deliverance.Field writes she did not understand why Reynolds wanted her in the film because she was not his typical leading lady and she thought that the \u0027script stinks\u0027.But his motives became clear when, to her surprise, he announced they were going on a date for their first meeting.Field writes: \u0027By the time we met, the weight of his stardom had become a way for Burt to control everyone around him, and from the moment I walked through the door, it was a way to control me. We were a perfect match of flaws\u0027.Their affair was \u0027instantaneous and intense\u0027, Field writes.          Field says that from the first time they met, Reynolds began to \u0027housebreak\u0027 her, telling her \u0027what was allowed and what was not\u0027          During the filming of Smokey and the Bandit his \u0027mysterious and painful\u0027 health episodes escalated and a doctor used to give Reynolds an injection of \u0027God knows what\u0027 directly into his chest.          Field learned not to talk about previous lovers and later became \u0027terrified\u0027 of running into any man she knew, regardless of whether or not she was in a relationship with him priorDuring the filming of Smokey and the Bandit his \u0027mysterious and painful\u0027 health episodes escalated and a doctor used to give Reynolds an injection of \u0027God knows what\u0027 directly into his chest.Field writes: \u0027This could not have been a good thing and I couldn\u0027t understand why everyone around him acted so nonchalant while this man was writhing in pain, panicked that his heart was about to stop\u0027.Field gave Reynolds a brown paper bag to breathe into and wrapped hot towels around his feet, face and hands. Reynolds also used to routinely use Valium and the painkiller Percodan to get through the day.During the filming of Smokey and the Bandit, Field writes: \u0027He was zooming the car down narrow roads, barely able to see around the forest of equipment and spouting reams of dialogue while I fed him barbiturates hand over fist.

If I give you two hundred that\u0027ll leave me with almost nothing\u0027.Field does talk about good times in their relationship like how Reynolds was an early adapter to the VHS player and that he gave her films such as The Searchers - the John Wayne western.Field writes about how with film made them \u0027love something together, which made us love each other\u0027.But Reynolds did not gel well with Field\u0027s two children, Peter, who was seven at the time, and Eli, who was four.He bought them go-karts for Christmas but they did not want to be bribed and his attempts to charm them \u0027flopped like a juicy fart at a family reunion\u0027.Reynolds became \u0027uncomfortable\u0027 around them so Field left them at home with her mother while she spent evenings with him, staying overnight and driving back early the next day.Field writes how she became \u0027overwhelmed with guilt\u0027 at neglecting her children for Reynolds ironically when she was with him she felt \u0027more trapped than with my children\u0027. When press reports began about Reynolds\u0027 cheating, Field\u0027s grandmother made sure she knew about it, calling her to report what was in the National Enquirer that week, and described the photos.           Field, 71, says in her memoir that her relationship with Reynolds was a replay of that with her stepfather, actor Jock Mahoney (pictured with him and her brother Rick in 1952), who sexually abused her from the when she was around six years old to 14          Jock Mahoney (pictured with Sally and her brother) was a stuntman who married Field\u0027s mother Margaret Field in 1952 after she orced her father Richard          Field (pictured in 1967) writes that she had a secret abortion in Tijuana, Mexico, when she was 17 years old during her sexual awakening which felt like she was \u0027breaking out of my own brain\u0027Field tried to brush it off but secretly she \u0027knew it was all true\u0027. She writes that she \u0027felt duped and a fool\u0027 but, still she stayed with Reynolds.Field writes that \u0027to be loved I had to stop being me\u0027 and in her journals at the time she wrote about wanting to \u0027run away, to escape from some hidden trap\u0027.She was \u0027bending myself into a pleasing shape, a soothing compliant cup of warm elixir that Burt was then lured into drinking over and over, until he became addicted to the seemingly unconditional love I was offering\u0027, she writes.The biggest role of Field\u0027s career was Norma Rae in 1979, about a textile factory worker who rallies her co-workers to unionize.Inevitably Reynolds objected to the role and told Field that \u0027no lady of mine is gonna play a whore\u0027. When Field said it was just a part she was playing, Reynolds mocked her, saying: \u0027Oh, so now you\u0027re an actor... you\u0027re letting your ambition get the better of you\u0027.Field defied him and took the part and on the last day of filming Reynolds drove to see her on the set and proposed with a diamond ring, which Field describes as \u0027not me\u0027. Field did not accept his proposal and they never married. She writes how Reynolds \u0027didn\u0027t speak and I didn\u0027t know what to say other than thank you, awkwardly\u0027. After Norma Rae finished filming, Field writes that her personality started to \u0027flare out\u0027, which was met with Reynolds\u0027 \u0027shocked disapproval\u0027. Field writes: \u0027As I began pulling away he tightened his grip, sometimes literally\u0027.           Field writes that Reynolds was \u0027engulfed by a massive wave of seeming instant notoriety, a sex symbol, and when his tsunami of collective unconscious slammed into him, he couldn\u0027t breathe\u0027            Burt Reynolds, who passed away on September 6, had a torrid romance with Sally Field for five-years starting when the co-starred in Smokey and the Bandit (pictured, 1977            After Reynolds died, Field said she was \u0027flooded with feelings and nostalgia\u0027 and was glad he would never read the bookWhen she called him to say she was going to the Cannes Film Festival he \u0027asked in a huff what the hell I intended to do there\u0027, branding it a \u0027waste of time\u0027.Reynolds\u0027 tone changed to \u0027deep disappointment\u0027 and he said that he had been house hunting for both of them and that she was \u0027spoiling it\u0027 for him.When Field couldn\u0027t be \u0027bullied or seduced\u0027 into changing her mind, Reynolds lashed out and said: \u0027You don\u0027t expect to win anything, do you?\u0027 and slammed the phone down.On the plane to France she describes a feeling of being \u0027wondrously free\u0027. And at Cannes, Field won the Palme d\u0027Or for best actress and went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress that year.Field\u0027s verdict on Reynolds is that people saw him as a charming, funny, good ol\u0027 boy from the South but inside he was tortured.She writes that he was \u0027engulfed by a massive wave of seeming instant notoriety, a sex symbol, and when his tsunami of collective unconscious slammed into him, he couldn\u0027t breathe\u0027.She writes: \u0027He also couldn\u0027t talk about it, couldn\u0027t articulate how it made him feel both empowered and terrified\u0027.Reynolds\u0027 fans saw him as the \u0027quintessential definition of masculine pulchritude\u0027 but according to Field: \u0027The human inside that dream figure was just a good-looking, ordinary person frantically trying to fulfill everyone\u0027s expectations\u0027,           Sally Field\u0027s revealing memoir \u0027In Pieces\u0027 (pictured) is set to hit stands September 18Field tells how when Reynolds was a senior in high school and playing on the varsity football team he cried on the pitch after winning the state championship.But his father came on the field and slapped him because, in his eyes, he was not behaving like a man.Field writes that Reynolds \u0027spent his life trying to prove to his father that he was a man worth loving\u0027. Field adds: \u0027He tried to hide everything about himself that he saw as being imperfect, to camouflage himself, which meant he got locked into a stressful trap of faking it\u0027.After Reynolds died, Field said she was \u0027flooded with feelings and nostalgia\u0027 and was glad he would never read the book.She said: \u0027This would hurt him.\u0027I felt glad that he wasn\u0027t going to read it, he wasn\u0027t going to be asked about it, and he wasn\u0027t going to have to defend himself or lash out, which he probably would have. I did not want to hurt him any further\u0027.Before the book\u0027s publication Field gave an interview to the New York Times which she revealed that the stepfather who abused her was Jock Mahoney, a stuntman who married Field\u0027s mother Margaret Field in 1952 after she orced her father Richard.Recounting the episode she writes: \u0027I felt both a child, helpless, and not a child. Powerful. This was power. And I owned it. But I wanted to be a child.\u0027Field writes that she had a secret abortion in Tijuana, Mexico, when she was 17 years old during her sexual awakening which felt like she was \u0027breaking out of my own brain\u0027.In 1968 Field got stoned with singer songwriter Jimmy Webb, passed out and woke up to find him \u0027on top of me, grinding away to another melody\u0027.Webb denied the encounter took place.While auditioning for the role of Mary Tate Farnsworth in the 1976 film \u0027Stay Hungry\u0027 Field said that director Bob Rafelson demanded she kiss him and said that \u0027I can\u0027t hire anyone who doesn\u0027t kiss good enough\u0027. Sally Field speaks out about her new memoir, \u0027In Pieces\u0027 Video - ABC News"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/16/01/4D49421500000578-0-image-a-9_1529107848181.jpg","title":"Traffic levels rise HALF 2050","story":"Traffic on Britain\u0027s roads is set to spiral by up to 50 percent by 2050 because of population growth, a new study has suggested (file image of the M25, London)The DFT study admits long term forecasts are \u0027complex\u0027 and the conclusions come with \u0027significant uncertainty\u0027. The Government has said it will use the forecast to \u0027inform the Department for Transport\u0027s road strategy\u0027.The predictions will not be used to influence decisions on specific local roads, which require more focused analysis. Labour officials meet after being accused of \u0027dragging their...Share this articleBritish drivers are expected to spend more time stuck in tailbacks, with the forecast predicting that the proportion of traffic in congested conditions will rise by between eight and 16 percent.Journey speeds are expected to suffer, too, with average speeds falling from 34 mph in 2015 to as little as 31 mph.The average journey in 2015 took 17 minutes, but this is expected to increase to 20 minutes by 2050.

Ms Spielman said the curriculum is a \u0027yardstick\u0027 for what school leaders want their pupils to know\u0027Pupil attainment and qualifications will always remain important as one measure of a school\u0027s effectiveness, and of course hugely important to young people themselves.\u0027From next autumn, inspectors will look much more closely at how a rounded curriculum is being delivered and Ms Spielman said a good curriculum gives a school purpose.\u0027Ultimately, the curriculum is the yardstick for what school leaders want their pupils to know and to be able to do by the time they leave school.\u0027It is therefore imperative that the new inspection framework has the curriculum as a central focus.\u0027Ms Spielman went on to highlight that, while the national curriculum \u0027provides us with an important benchmark\u0027, the way it is delivered should be up for the schools and school leaders to decide.\u0027It should depend on a number of factors relevant to a particular school\u0027s context and the knowledge and expertise of curriculum leaders.\u0027In response to this, Geoff Barton, general-secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u0027We support, in principle, Ofsted\u0027s intention to focus more on the curriculum and less on test and exam results.\u0027Done well, it has the potential to liberate schools and teachers from the grinding pressure of preparing for Sats in primary schools and GCSEs in secondary schools, and feel empowered to concentrate more on a broad, balanced and rich curriculum.\u0027Our concern, however, is that this does not translate into an Ofsted-prescribed curriculum, and we are reassured by the chief inspector\u0027s commentary which recognises the importance of schools having the autonomy to choose the curriculum which most benefits their students.\u0027It is essential that the new Ofsted framework champions the distinctiveness of schools to serve the needs of their communities.\u0027  HMCI commentary: curriculum and the new education inspection framework - GOV.UK"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/01/16/4EABD51300000578-0-image-m-17_1533136441030.jpg","title":"JANET STREET PORTER Lets salute King Punk John Lydon letting hang out","story":"    Janet Street-Porter met John Lydon over 42 years ago in 1976, when he and the newly formed Sex Pistols played at a Valentine’s Day party in a loft by London’s Tower Bridge          janet Street Porter and Johnny Rotten in 1978.

We are so used to the likes of Rod Steward on a carefully choreographed airport stroll (for the press, naturally) complete with loving wife holding his hand, (she probably selected his on-trend Gucci slippers), perfectly pressed trousers and precisely ruffled hair, that Johnny Lydon’s tramp-like persona comes a bit of a rude reality check.

This is what sixty-something men look like when they can drink large amounts of beer without a partner giving them the ‘forget it’ stare. This is what men of a certain age look like when they are away from home and can eat the crap they really like (fast food full of grease and carbs- which is all you can get anyway at 11pm after a gig and you’ve signed hundreds of autographs and posed for selfies).John does look as if touring with his band and publicising a new documentary (The Public Image is Rotten) has impacted on his waistline. It might have expanded but I very much doubt there’s be much change in his mental outlook- this isn’t someone who is going to turn into a docile pensioner any day soon.We met back over 42 years ago in 1976, when he and the newly formed Sex Pistols played at a Valentine’s Day party in a loft by London’s Tower Bridge. It was early days- the band sounded appalling, and their performance came to an abrupt end when the PA system failed. The road crew started to fight with the sound technicians and I left before it got nasty.That autumn, I made a television documentary about the rise of Punk Rock, filming the Clash and then the Sex Pistols- it was to be their first TV appearance. I tried to film an interview with John in a squat in Soho and got a stuffed rat chucked at my head as he spouted ‘I don’t have no heroes, they’re all useless’. What an anthem for anyone under 21, back in the days when Maggie Thatcher was leader of the Tory party and the British government was male, middle aged and mediocre- not to mention white.          Janet Street-Porter\u0027s television documentary gave Johnny Rotten his first television exposureThat footage has now been shown around the world, along with the Sex Pistols’ performance in a church hall we hired for the occasion. Lydon’s stage presence was simply electrifying- and Elton John rang me one Sunday, asking to meet to discuss the revolution that was going on in pop music. Elton was totally bowled over by punk, realising that nothing in pop would be the same again.John Lydon didn’t just take on the establishment with hits like God Save the Queen, his alternative National Anthem (which topped the charts in the Queen’s Silver Jubilee Year in 1977) and Anarchy in the UK, he sent shock waves through the world of popular music- he mouthed off about Queen and ‘pomp’ rock, played in a pubs and small village halls where kids could get up close- everything mega stars like Rod Stewart had left behind long ago.          John Lydon aka Jonny Rotten performing with The Sex Pistols in 1977I’ve known him through three of my marriages, while he’s always been devoted to one partner for almost 40 years. Nora has been his rock and his soul mate, a woman who shuns the limelight and gets on with her life. A man of many contradictions, a shy sensitive soul who carefully keeps that aspect of his personality hidden, a loud mouth who can terrify any hard-bitten interviewer with one withering F*** off. From Vogue to your local newspaper, he doesn’t discriminate, but behind that belligerent façade lurks a highly intelligent bloke.At my 50th birthday guests like Stephen Fry, Ruby Wax and Ian McKellen and the boss of the BBC all queued up to be insulted by the king of Punk.

We were a perfect match of flaws\u0027.Their affair was \u0027instantaneous and intense\u0027, Field writes.          Field says that from the first time they met, Reynolds began to \u0027housebreak\u0027 her, telling her \u0027what was allowed and what was not\u0027          During the filming of Smokey and the Bandit his \u0027mysterious and painful\u0027 health episodes escalated and a doctor used to give Reynolds an injection of \u0027God knows what\u0027 directly into his chest.

Reynolds also used to routinely use Valium and the painkiller Percodan to get through the day.During the filming of Smokey and the Bandit, Field writes: \u0027He was zooming the car down narrow roads, barely able to see around the forest of equipment and spouting reams of dialogue while I fed him barbiturates hand over fist.

If I give you two hundred that\u0027ll leave me with almost nothing\u0027.Field does talk about good times in their relationship like how Reynolds was an early adapter to the VHS player and that he gave her films such as The Searchers - the John Wayne western.Field writes about how with film made them \u0027love something together, which made us love each other\u0027.But Reynolds did not gel well with Field\u0027s two children, Peter, who was seven at the time, and Eli, who was four.He bought them go-karts for Christmas but they did not want to be bribed and his attempts to charm them \u0027flopped like a juicy fart at a family reunion\u0027.Reynolds became \u0027uncomfortable\u0027 around them so Field left them at home with her mother while she spent evenings with him, staying overnight and driving back early the next day.Field writes how she became \u0027overwhelmed with guilt\u0027 at neglecting her children for Reynolds ironically when she was with him she felt \u0027more trapped than with my children\u0027. When press reports began about Reynolds\u0027 cheating, Field\u0027s grandmother made sure she knew about it, calling her to report what was in the National Enquirer that week, and described the photos.           Field, 71, says in her memoir that her relationship with Reynolds was a replay of that with her stepfather, actor Jock Mahoney (pictured with him and her brother Rick in 1952), who sexually abused her from the when she was around six years old to 14          Jock Mahoney (pictured with Sally and her brother) was a stuntman who married Field\u0027s mother Margaret Field in 1952 after she orced her father Richard          Field (pictured in 1967) writes that she had a secret abortion in Tijuana, Mexico, when she was 17 years old during her sexual awakening which felt like she was \u0027breaking out of my own brain\u0027Field tried to brush it off but secretly she \u0027knew it was all true\u0027. She writes that she \u0027felt duped and a fool\u0027 but, still she stayed with Reynolds.Field writes that \u0027to be loved I had to stop being me\u0027 and in her journals at the time she wrote about wanting to \u0027run away, to escape from some hidden trap\u0027.She was \u0027bending myself into a pleasing shape, a soothing compliant cup of warm elixir that Burt was then lured into drinking over and over, until he became addicted to the seemingly unconditional love I was offering\u0027, she writes.The biggest role of Field\u0027s career was Norma Rae in 1979, about a textile factory worker who rallies her co-workers to unionize.Inevitably Reynolds objected to the role and told Field that \u0027no lady of mine is gonna play a whore\u0027. When Field said it was just a part she was playing, Reynolds mocked her, saying: \u0027Oh, so now you\u0027re an actor... you\u0027re letting your ambition get the better of you\u0027.Field defied him and took the part and on the last day of filming Reynolds drove to see her on the set and proposed with a diamond ring, which Field describes as \u0027not me\u0027. Field did not accept his proposal and they never married. She writes how Reynolds \u0027didn\u0027t speak and I didn\u0027t know what to say other than thank you, awkwardly\u0027. After Norma Rae finished filming, Field writes that her personality started to \u0027flare out\u0027, which was met with Reynolds\u0027 \u0027shocked disapproval\u0027. Field writes: \u0027As I began pulling away he tightened his grip, sometimes literally\u0027.           Field writes that Reynolds was \u0027engulfed by a massive wave of seeming instant notoriety, a sex symbol, and when his tsunami of collective unconscious slammed into him, he couldn\u0027t breathe\u0027            Burt Reynolds, who passed away on September 6, had a torrid romance with Sally Field for five-years starting when the co-starred in Smokey and the Bandit (pictured, 1977            After Reynolds died, Field said she was \u0027flooded with feelings and nostalgia\u0027 and was glad he would never read the bookWhen she called him to say she was going to the Cannes Film Festival he \u0027asked in a huff what the hell I intended to do there\u0027, branding it a \u0027waste of time\u0027.Reynolds\u0027 tone changed to \u0027deep disappointment\u0027 and he said that he had been house hunting for both of them and that she was \u0027spoiling it\u0027 for him.When Field couldn\u0027t be \u0027bullied or seduced\u0027 into changing her mind, Reynolds lashed out and said: \u0027You don\u0027t expect to win anything, do you?\u0027 and slammed the phone down.On the plane to France she describes a feeling of being \u0027wondrously free\u0027. And at Cannes, Field won the Palme d\u0027Or for best actress and went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress that year.Field\u0027s verdict on Reynolds is that people saw him as a charming, funny, good ol\u0027 boy from the South but inside he was tortured.She writes that he was \u0027engulfed by a massive wave of seeming instant notoriety, a sex symbol, and when his tsunami of collective unconscious slammed into him, he couldn\u0027t breathe\u0027.She writes: \u0027He also couldn\u0027t talk about it, couldn\u0027t articulate how it made him feel both empowered and terrified\u0027.Reynolds\u0027 fans saw him as the \u0027quintessential definition of masculine pulchritude\u0027 but according to Field: \u0027The human inside that dream figure was just a good-looking, ordinary person frantically trying to fulfill everyone\u0027s expectations\u0027,           Sally Field\u0027s revealing memoir \u0027In Pieces\u0027 (pictured) is set to hit stands September 18Field tells how when Reynolds was a senior in high school and playing on the varsity football team he cried on the pitch after winning the state championship.But his father came on the field and slapped him because, in his eyes, he was not behaving like a man.Field writes that Reynolds \u0027spent his life trying to prove to his father that he was a man worth loving\u0027. Field adds: \u0027He tried to hide everything about himself that he saw as being imperfect, to camouflage himself, which meant he got locked into a stressful trap of faking it\u0027.After Reynolds died, Field said she was \u0027flooded with feelings and nostalgia\u0027 and was glad he would never read the book.She said: \u0027This would hurt him.\u0027I felt glad that he wasn\u0027t going to read it, he wasn\u0027t going to be asked about it, and he wasn\u0027t going to have to defend himself or lash out, which he probably would have. I did not want to hurt him any further\u0027.Before the book\u0027s publication Field gave an interview to the New York Times which she revealed that the stepfather who abused her was Jock Mahoney, a stuntman who married Field\u0027s mother Margaret Field in 1952 after she orced her father Richard.Recounting the episode she writes: \u0027I felt both a child, helpless, and not a child. Powerful. This was power. And I owned it. But I wanted to be a child.\u0027Field writes that she had a secret abortion in Tijuana, Mexico, when she was 17 years old during her sexual awakening which felt like she was \u0027breaking out of my own brain\u0027.In 1968 Field got stoned with singer songwriter Jimmy Webb, passed out and woke up to find him \u0027on top of me, grinding away to another melody\u0027.Webb denied the encounter took place.While auditioning for the role of Mary Tate Farnsworth in the 1976 film \u0027Stay Hungry\u0027 Field said that director Bob Rafelson demanded she kiss him and said that \u0027I can\u0027t hire anyone who doesn\u0027t kiss good enough\u0027. Sally Field speaks out about her new memoir, \u0027In Pieces\u0027 Video - ABC News"},{"url":null,"title":"Bridesmaid received dress BA two hours ceremony","story":"    Nicole Park, booked a BA flight from Thailand to Heathrow and onward to Glasgow for her best friend\u0027s big day.

One of the Bentley team said: ’Would you mind not taking photographs of our cars.’But parked up on a public highway, they were in the public place and therefore fair game to be photographed.Belatedly they attempted to block the view of one of the cars as two of the large golden 4X4s provided an honour guard for the convertible. However, by then the pictures were already in the can.At the beginning of September a disguised GT convertible was photographed in a spy-shot during high speed tests on Germany’s Nurburgring circuit. But this is believed to be the first time the car has been seen in public on UK roads.The third generation of the Bentley GT was unveiled last August (2017) ahead of its public debut at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September and first deliveries in Spring this year.It is the most hi-tech Bentley ever launched with the world’s first three-way rotating dashboard that takes its inspiration from James Bond’s famous revolving number plate. A clever triangular ‘Toblerone-style’ device showing three different dashboard ‘faces’ allows the driver to choose which one to view.It is inspired by the rotating number-plate gadget used in the James Bond movie ‘Goldfinger’ on 007’s gadget-laden Aston Martin DB5 – using three-sided faces, like on the distinctive triangular packaging of the Toblerone bar of chocolate.    The convoy included three Bentley Bentayga 4X4s (two gold, one white), a blue Bentley Continental GT hard-top and an Audi A3 hatchbackThe new third generation 207mph Bentley Continental GT costs £160,000 and is built in Britain at the firm’s factory in Crewe which employs 4,000 people. Some 66,000 have been sold since the first was launched in 2003, with the second generation in 2011.It accelerates from rest to 60mph in just 3.6 seconds – 0.7 seconds faster than its predecessor - thanks to its powerful and enhanced 6.0-litre W12 turbo-charged petrol engine developing 626 brake-horsepower (635PS) and linked to a slick new eight-speed dual-clutch automatic gear-box. Top speed is 9mph faster than the outgoing car. Fittingly, the braking system is the most powerful system ever fitted to a Bentley, with a total of 28 pistons.But it’s a bit of a gas-guzzler and averages just 23.2mpg, dropping to 16.0mpg around town.But Bentley bosses aim to make Bentleys ‘greener’ with electric hybrid and fully electric versin. It took the first step at this year’s Geneva Motor Show in March when it unveiled the new £140,000 petrol-electric Bentayga Hybrid sports utility vehicle which the firm is dubbing ‘the world’s first luxury hybrid’.          The new third generation 207mph Bentley Continental GT costs £160,000 and is built in Britain at the firm’s factory in Crewe which employs 4,000 peopleBut new chief executive and ‘Bentley Boy’ Adrian Hallmark stressed that this is ‘just the start’ and represents Bentley’s first step towards ‘full electrification’ of the Bentley range as the firm seeks to shed its ‘gas-guzzler’ reputation.Hallmark’s stated aim is to have 100 per cent hybrid or electric power available on all models across the Bentley range by 2025. The new luxury hybrid sets Bentley ’on the path towards a sustainable electrified future,’ he said.Bentley say the new Continental GT is the ‘most technologically advanced car’ they have ever produced – with 2,300 circuit boards, five miles of wiring (8km), 92 electronic control units, and 100million lines of computer code , some 15 times the amount on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, to make it all work.It also features a luxury Handcrafted cabin with 10sq metres of veneer wood that takes 9 hours to create and fit, eight handcrafted veneers plus four ‘dual’ veneers, 15 choices of interior trim hide, and 15 luxury carpet options, diamond-style pattern on knobs and trim inspired by luxury Swiss watch-makers, and 20-way adjustable seats with cooling, heating and massage functions.Bentley, part of the giant Volkswagen group, are proud the Continental GT has been ‘designed, engineered and handcrafted in Britain’. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/13/502053BE00000578-0-image-m-16_1536840497280.jpg","title":"The booze map Britain Beer nations number one tipple","story":"    This graphic shows the biggest beer lovers in the UK, ranking them from 1 to 5.

Ms Spielman said the curriculum is a \u0027yardstick\u0027 for what school leaders want their pupils to know\u0027Pupil attainment and qualifications will always remain important as one measure of a school\u0027s effectiveness, and of course hugely important to young people themselves.\u0027From next autumn, inspectors will look much more closely at how a rounded curriculum is being delivered and Ms Spielman said a good curriculum gives a school purpose.\u0027Ultimately, the curriculum is the yardstick for what school leaders want their pupils to know and to be able to do by the time they leave school.\u0027It is therefore imperative that the new inspection framework has the curriculum as a central focus.\u0027Ms Spielman went on to highlight that, while the national curriculum \u0027provides us with an important benchmark\u0027, the way it is delivered should be up for the schools and school leaders to decide.\u0027It should depend on a number of factors relevant to a particular school\u0027s context and the knowledge and expertise of curriculum leaders.\u0027In response to this, Geoff Barton, general-secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u0027We support, in principle, Ofsted\u0027s intention to focus more on the curriculum and less on test and exam results.\u0027Done well, it has the potential to liberate schools and teachers from the grinding pressure of preparing for Sats in primary schools and GCSEs in secondary schools, and feel empowered to concentrate more on a broad, balanced and rich curriculum.\u0027Our concern, however, is that this does not translate into an Ofsted-prescribed curriculum, and we are reassured by the chief inspector\u0027s commentary which recognises the importance of schools having the autonomy to choose the curriculum which most benefits their students.\u0027It is essential that the new Ofsted framework champions the distinctiveness of schools to serve the needs of their communities.\u0027  HMCI commentary: curriculum and the new education inspection framework - GOV.UK"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/01/16/4EABD51300000578-0-image-m-17_1533136441030.jpg","title":"JANET STREET PORTER Lets salute King Punk John Lydon letting hang out","story":"    Janet Street-Porter met John Lydon over 42 years ago in 1976, when he and the newly formed Sex Pistols played at a Valentine’s Day party in a loft by London’s Tower Bridge          janet Street Porter and Johnny Rotten in 1978.

We are so used to the likes of Rod Steward on a carefully choreographed airport stroll (for the press, naturally) complete with loving wife holding his hand, (she probably selected his on-trend Gucci slippers), perfectly pressed trousers and precisely ruffled hair, that Johnny Lydon’s tramp-like persona comes a bit of a rude reality check.

This is what sixty-something men look like when they can drink large amounts of beer without a partner giving them the ‘forget it’ stare. This is what men of a certain age look like when they are away from home and can eat the crap they really like (fast food full of grease and carbs- which is all you can get anyway at 11pm after a gig and you’ve signed hundreds of autographs and posed for selfies).John does look as if touring with his band and publicising a new documentary (The Public Image is Rotten) has impacted on his waistline. It might have expanded but I very much doubt there’s be much change in his mental outlook- this isn’t someone who is going to turn into a docile pensioner any day soon.We met back over 42 years ago in 1976, when he and the newly formed Sex Pistols played at a Valentine’s Day party in a loft by London’s Tower Bridge. It was early days- the band sounded appalling, and their performance came to an abrupt end when the PA system failed. The road crew started to fight with the sound technicians and I left before it got nasty.That autumn, I made a television documentary about the rise of Punk Rock, filming the Clash and then the Sex Pistols- it was to be their first TV appearance. I tried to film an interview with John in a squat in Soho and got a stuffed rat chucked at my head as he spouted ‘I don’t have no heroes, they’re all useless’. What an anthem for anyone under 21, back in the days when Maggie Thatcher was leader of the Tory party and the British government was male, middle aged and mediocre- not to mention white.          Janet Street-Porter\u0027s television documentary gave Johnny Rotten his first television exposureThat footage has now been shown around the world, along with the Sex Pistols’ performance in a church hall we hired for the occasion. Lydon’s stage presence was simply electrifying- and Elton John rang me one Sunday, asking to meet to discuss the revolution that was going on in pop music. Elton was totally bowled over by punk, realising that nothing in pop would be the same again.John Lydon didn’t just take on the establishment with hits like God Save the Queen, his alternative National Anthem (which topped the charts in the Queen’s Silver Jubilee Year in 1977) and Anarchy in the UK, he sent shock waves through the world of popular music- he mouthed off about Queen and ‘pomp’ rock, played in a pubs and small village halls where kids could get up close- everything mega stars like Rod Stewart had left behind long ago.          John Lydon aka Jonny Rotten performing with The Sex Pistols in 1977I’ve known him through three of my marriages, while he’s always been devoted to one partner for almost 40 years. Nora has been his rock and his soul mate, a woman who shuns the limelight and gets on with her life. A man of many contradictions, a shy sensitive soul who carefully keeps that aspect of his personality hidden, a loud mouth who can terrify any hard-bitten interviewer with one withering F*** off. From Vogue to your local newspaper, he doesn’t discriminate, but behind that belligerent façade lurks a highly intelligent bloke.At my 50th birthday guests like Stephen Fry, Ruby Wax and Ian McKellen and the boss of the BBC all queued up to be insulted by the king of Punk. What an inspiration. Let’s raise a glass to John Lydon, for proudly letting it all hang out in sweat pants."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/16/02/503BFA6D00000578-0-image-a-11_1537062694514.jpg","title":"North Koreans Kim Jong South Koreas Moon toast peace talks lavish banquet","story":"    South Korean President Moon Jae-in, left, toasts with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and his wife Ri Sol Ju during a welcome banquet in Pyongyang          Moon Jae-in (left) and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (right) clap as they watch an art performance by Samjiyon Orchestra at Pyongyang Grand Theatre          A big screen shows a picture of both Korean leaders holding their hands aloft during an art performance by Samjiyon Orchestra          Moon Jae-in (left), his wife Kim Jung-sook (second right), Kim Jong-un (second left) and his wife Ri Sol Ju (right) waved to the crowds at the Pyongyang Grand TheatreMoon wants to see stalled denuclearisation talks between his hosts and the United States begin again. The North\u0027s unique brand of choreographed mass adulation was on full display as hundreds of people waved North Korean flags and another depicting an unided peninsula - while the South\u0027s own emblem was only visible on Moon\u0027s Boeing 747 aircraft. Hundreds of North Koreans in colourful, traditional dress waved unification flags at the tarmac in Pyongyang as South Korea\u0027s Moon arrived.After the pair embraced, they travelled from the airport by car.

More than 40,000 people in the UK are thought to die early every year because of air pollution.Earlier this week, scientists revealed they had found tiny particles of vehicle soot in the wombs of pregnant women, suggesting even unborn babies are at risk.The lead author of the new research, Professor Frank Kelly, calculated 7 per cent of cases of dementia could be attributed to air pollution. If applied to the 850,000 cases in the UK, his figures suggest 60,000 cases could be prevented if air pollution was eradicated.Professor Kelly, of King\u0027s College London and a government adviser on air pollution, said: \u0027This is a very serious problem. The more we look at all the chronic diseases in society, the more air pollution crops up as a recurring factor.\u0027We\u0027re not saying air pollution is the only cause of dementia. But by tackling air pollution, even if you merely delayed the onset of dementia, that would be of enormous benefit for families and the health service.\u0027The research team, whose findings were published in the BMJ Open medical journal last night, tracked 131,000 people aged 50 to 79 living within Greater London, and followed them for seven years.Using participants\u0027 postcodes, they looked at air pollution data and compared it to their health records. They found people living in the most polluted areas were far more likely to develop dementia.          As part of the study 131,000 people aged 50 to 79 living in the Greater London area were analysedThose living in areas with the highest 20 per cent of nitrogen dioxide emissions had a 40 per cent increased dementia risk. Diesel cars – particularly the older models – produce far more nitrogen dioxide than petrol vehicles.The scientists also found that people with the highest 20 per cent exposure to microscopic sooty particles – also linked to diesel – had a 26 per cent increased risk of dementia.Professor Kelly, who chairs the Department of Health\u0027s committee on the medical effects of air pollution, said: \u0027On the road, older diesel vehicles are by far the most polluting. It\u0027s not just cars – it\u0027s the buses and the taxis.\u0027Although the study focused only on people living within the M25, experts are convinced it is representative of the whole country.A wipe with a face cloth instead of a shower, unable to see...\u0027We realised things weren’t going to be fine\u0027: Wife whose...Share this articleThe UK is notoriously bad at controlling air pollution, with 37 cities persistently displaying illegal levels and the Government repeatedly being hauled into court over the past few years.Simon Alcock, of environmental law firm ClientEarth, said: \u0027Air pollution is damaging our health from the womb to old age. It is unacceptable in 2018 for people to be risking dementia just by breathing. We need big, bold action from the Government to clean up the air and protect our health.\u0027The microscopic particles in air pollution are breathed deep into the lungs and enter the blood stream. Scientists believe they then travel into the brain where they provoke inflammation – a problem which may trigger dementia.          Several car giants including BMW, Mercedes and VW among others are being investigated over the emissions technologyThe commission said it would examine whether the group agreed to avoid competing against each other in the race to install \u0027clean emission devices\u0027 in diesel and petrol cars sold throughout Europe.Emissions-cutting devices are expensive and push up the cost of building cars, meaning there would have been a financial incentive for manufacturers to drag their heels.The European commission said if car makers did conspire with each other, this would amount to a breach of the EU\u0027s anti-trust rules which outlaw cartels.Commissioner Margrethe Vestager added: \u0027If proven, this collusion may have denied consumers the opportunity to buy less polluting cars, despite the technology being available to the manufacturers.\u0027VW, Daimler and BMW said they would continue to co-operate with the commission\u0027s investigation but could not comment on the ongoing case.                                                    \u0027Greater investment is also needed in alternatives to motor vehicles, such as safer cycling infrastructure, and affordable and convenient public transport.\u0027But Dr James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer\u0027s Society, pointed out that the research had looked only at the chance of developing dementia, and had not actually proved that the pollution had caused the illness. \u0027There is evidence that exposure to air pollution can cause small particles to enter the brain, but it\u0027s a huge leap to say that air pollution could lead to dementia and this study had several limitations,\u0027 he said.A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u0027Air pollution is the top environmental risk to human health in the UK, and while air quality has improved significantly since 2010, we recognise there is more to do.\u0027This is why we have put in place a £3.5 billion plan to reduce harmful emissions from road transport and have launched an ambitious Clean Air Strategy which has been commended by the World Health Organisation.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/18/21/505F2EA600000578-6182185-image-a-47_1537303889681.jpg","title":"Were not taking dog K9 called Titan takes kidnap baby suspect Florida","story":"    Pasco County Sheriff\u0027s K9 Titan gets on the trail of suspect Kevin Wilson\u0027s scent.

Unilever announced this week it was planning on ditching its UK-based HQ in favour of RotterdamIf Unilever shifts its domicile to the Netherlands, its shares will no longer qualify for the FTSE 100 Index in London.Institutional investors feel they are, in effect, being asked by Polman to collude in a Dutch takeover of Unilever.This may ultimately depress the value of their shares as FTSE 100 tracker funds are compelled to sell their holdings. Understandably, many — including some of our biggest companies — are making their anger felt.Over the years, Unilever has built up a wonderful track record of never cutting its idends, which has made it an ideal investment for retirement. The company may not have offered exciting immediate yields or high instant returns, but it was hard to beat over the longer-term.ROBERT HARDMAN: Port Sunlight’s visionary founder will be...£100m backlash begins against Unilever’s bid to close UK HQ:...Unilever boss claims to be Geordie – but is more Sting than...Share this articleThat is what made Unilever beloved of stockbrokers and fund-holders. Now, all that is at risk.Polman, set to retire next year, says he wants to simplify the firm\u0027s structures with one corporate HQ (currently there are two, in London and Rotterdam), reducing bureaucracy and duplication.In theory, I agree. Having more than one HQ dissipates a unifying sense of purpose and means executives waste far too much time shuttling between organisations.But why on earth has he chosen the Netherlands rather than Britain?This country should have been the obvious choice. Apart from its history here, 60 per cent of Unilever\u0027s sales originate from the UK, while English, the global language of commerce, gives us a huge competitive advantage, especially in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America, where Unilever household and beauty products are becoming popular.The pro-EU brigade will insist that Polman\u0027s choice was driven by Brexit. According to their narrative, the Leave vote has left Britain hopelessly cut off from Europe, so more moves like Unilever\u0027s are inevitable. But this is a warped analysis based on politicised wishful thinking.The probable reason lies in the chief executive\u0027s instinctive preference, as a Dutchman, for his homeland over Britain and for the Dutch model of capitalism.It provides greater protection against predatory bids by foreign firms, and after a brutal takeover attempt of Unilever by global giant Kraft Heinz last year, Polman has good cause to be wary of similar initiatives that the more open market in Britain encourages.But he will also have been heavily influenced by the Dutch government\u0027s recent decision to agree in principle a more welcoming tax environment for corporations, particularly through a reduction in the taxation of shareholders\u0027 idends.In fact, the Dutch tax changes planned for 2020 — bringing the country\u0027s tax structure into line with that of other more tax-friendly countries, including Britain — were specifically intended to lure companies like Unilever.          Brexit has cast doubt onto several firms\u0027 headquarters in the UK - sparking fears they could move to EU countriesCompetitiveIt may not be a coincidence that Mark Rutte, the prime minister of the Netherlands who initiated the changes, was a manager at Unilever before he entered politics.Ministers here should take note: Britain may be losing one of its great companies because a Continental neighbour has adopted a more competitive corporate tax regime.So how should we respond? How can we make Britain the place where the world comes to do business, while protecting our corporate heritage?We know that corporate taxes and red tape shackle enterprise. And to be fair, this Government has taken some steps in this direction by lowering corporation tax to a record low of 19 per cent.Contrary to the warnings of the doom-mongers who wailed about \u0027giveaways to the super-rich\u0027, these tax reductions actually increased Treasury revenues, with corporation tax take rising from £44 billion to £58 billion over the past three years.That\u0027s all well and good. But to unleash commercial dynamism fully, I believe the Government should abolish corporation tax altogether. Employment and investment would soar and, instead of seeing companies making plans to leave Britain, I have no doubt that they would come flocking.The knock-on effect, of course, would be that the accompanying explosion in wealth and job creation would generate increased revenues for the Government.ProsperityWe are living in a much more fluid, globalised world. Capital can be transferred across the globe at a click of a mouse. Governments have to adopt radical new thinking if they want businesses to stay and flourish.Whatever you think of Brexit, the fact is we are leaving the EU, so surely we should be pulling together to make a success of it.I believe that Brexit offers a golden opportunity for a major reset on our national approach to taxation and enterprise. It is through the embrace of the global free market that real prosperity lies — if only Westminster and Whitehall would seize the moment.Sadly, I fear it may come too late to save Unilever for Britain.

But really I want Unilever to remain where it was born.Leaving the EU should give us new opportunities to export and trade with the world, but we will only succeed if we are fit, ready and business-friendly.That\u0027s why the Government should be working night and day to encourage and empower the thousands of businesses which will drive Britain forward in the years to come.  £100m backlash begins against Unilever\u0027s bid to close UK HQ: Crisis as investors launch bid to stop Marmite-maker relocating to NetherlandsUnilever\u0027s bid to ditch its UK headquarters faced a full-blown crisis last nightM\u0026ampG Investments said it will oppose the firm\u0027s proposal for a single legal base in the NetherlandsThree of Aviva\u0027s investors have already warned against the change                                                                        ByJames Burton Chief City Correspondent For The Daily MailUnilever\u0027s bid to ditch its UK headquarters faced a full-blown crisis last night.Savings giant M\u0026ampG Investments said it will oppose the firm\u0027s proposal for a single legal base in the Netherlands.Aviva Investors, Columbia Threadneedle and Lindsell Train – Unilever\u0027s third largest shareholder in London – have already warned against the change.

But the real star of this show about humour in art is the rescued fire station much of it is housed inKnock Knock! Who’s there? A Welshman overly fond of sheep. Rodney Graham, seated on a park bench, eyeing the world through two small holes torn in the newspaper he’s pretending to read. A clown and a tin-foil flailing rock-god guitarist. Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse and the real Snow White. Here comes everybody.Filling the South London Gallery and its new expansion into the 19th-century fire station across the Peckham Road, Knock Knock – the title taken not just from the hoary old formula for a joke, but also from a drawing by Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein – has been curated by South London Gallery director Margot Heller and artist Ryan Gander.Knock Knock jokes usually evince a groan. Stop me if you’ve heard this one before. Stop me before I kill again. Artists who are genuinely funny, and whose wit is complex enough to sustain, and even to deepen, on repeated viewings are uncommon. Swiss duo Fischli and Weiss, David Shrigley, Ed Ruscha, Nicole Eisenman, Paul McCarthy, Bruce Nauman all come to mind. They’re not here. Nor is Andy Holden, whose recent animated films, as well as being very funny, analyse humour itself in deft, often sly ways. Perhaps a funny thing happened to him on the way to the gallery.I like a good laugh as well as the next miserable art critic. Featuring a mix of old works and new, of pieces and artists who have shown previously at SLG, much of the humour here really has to be worked at. One-liners and no-liners, impenetrable sight gags that leave me dumbfounded, things that just aren’t funny at all, and perhaps aren’t even trying to be, fill the galleries. In one of the best works, Harold Offeh’s 2001 video Smile, the artist grimaces with a rictus grin to Nat King Cole’s 1954 version of the song Smile (Charlie Chaplin composed the music). Offeh follows the song’s injunction to smile, but it looks like a terrible ordeal.The big, open space of the original 1891 gallery is dominated by Joyce Pensato’s Take Me to Your Leader, an enormous charcoal drawing in which Mickey Mouse confronts a group of Donald Ducks. I like the drawing well enough, though its scale seems unnecessary. Martin Creed’s big, black diagonal stripes on an adjacent wall evince a sort of blank fury. A saw seems to be about to cut a circular hole in the gallery floor from below in a work by Ceal Floyer. Maybe she’s trying to help us escape. A brick foot and a brick ball, by Judith Hopf, aren’t going to have a kick-about soon, and if you try to have a go with Masim Bagdy’s basketball hoop you would break it. It is made of glass. Ba-boom.Many things here defeat me. Heman Chong has printed the internet 404 error phrase “Something went wrong. We’re working on getting it fixed as soon as we can” on one of the doors, while Maurizio Cattelan’s stuffed flock of pigeons have infested the gallery eaves. An old gag, but sometimes they’re the best. Bedwyr Williams has parked his bike in the corridor. The bicycle’s frame has been upholstered in sheep fur, the handlebars are a pair of horns and there’s a sheep skull poking out the front. Fucking Inbred Welsh Sheepshagger, it is called, turning the xenophobic English insult against the Welsh back on itself.The real star of the show is the building across the street, where the show continues in the old Peckham Road Fire Station, donated anonymously to the gallery after it was sold at auction in 2008 and left derelict for several years. Built in 1867, the fire station – with its horse-drawn carriages kept on the ground floor, and the firemen and their families housed above, has been gutted and rebuilt. 6a Architects have provided a stack of larger and smaller exhibition and project spaces, an archive room and a kitchen. Various original features remain (a fireplace hangs high on a blank wall in the opened-up full-height stairwell, and a replica of the original station gaslight hangs outside, the word ENGINES printed on the glass). A small group of concrete sheep nestle in the vertiginous stairwell. Basic concrete blocks mounted on old table legs, Judith Hopf’s little flock are only identifiable as sheep by the cartoonish sheep faces drawn on the bare concrete. Better keep Bedwyr Williams away from them. He might do himself a mischief.On the floor a man lies sleeping. Wrapped in a sheepskin and a towel, and his face painted as a clown, Ugo Rondinone’s lifelike sculpture has a drift of glitter at his feet. Like several other works here, the title of Rondinone’s sculpture is at least as intriguing as the 2002 work itself. If There Were Anywhere But Desert, Friday, it is called. Upstairs, Sarah Lucas’s latest mannequin perches on a chair. With her lewd breasts, long bendy legs and clumping blue velvet shoes that look far too big, Lucas’s Yves (named after Yves Klein, maybe because of the blue heels she wears) is as vulnerable as she is provocative. Ryan Gander’s animatronic pair of eyes, inset in the wall, blink and follow you round the room. Tom Friedman’s kitchen-foil guitarist flails his silver-foil hair. On a grainy video, Lucy Gunning’s 1994 The Horse Impressionists whinny and neigh. Still funny, Gunning’s work also feels old-fashioned, even quaint, like an old comedy re-run on a dead-zone channel. In its way, there’s human pathos in there, too, oddly amplified, like Offeh’s Smile, by the passage of time.With its beautiful Gabriel Orozco garden, its incursion into adjoining buildings and the council estate behind, where it hosts community projects and art classes, and now with the fire station across the street, South London Gallery has slowly, incrementally expanded over the past decade. And the works keep coming, as you mount the stairs and go from room to room. Cartoons, sound works, an ice cream cone, slightly sinister drawings and in-jokes I’m still trying to get. It’s not exactly a bundle of laughs but it keeps you on the move, looking for a punchline, which might be the point.• Knock Knock: Humour in Contemporary Art is at the South London Gallery, from 22 September until 18 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0350a4e9a8452631d188a55449f30a7d062623c8/73_285_6627_3977/master/6627.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e0278818579eb9c8f15610221481f30","title":"strictly analogue polaroids past present and future a photo essay","story":" photographer Christian Sinibaldi tours the world’s last Polaroid film factory, in the Netherlands, the only remaining factory still making film for the much-loved instant camerasby  Christian Sinibaldi and  Mee-Lai StoneThe Polaroid Corporation was launched in 1937 becoming a touchstone for American innovation and engineering prowess. It was the brainchild of scientist and inventor Edwin Land and his Harvard tutor George Wheelwright and at first made the plastic for polarising sunglasses. In time, it was to create and popularise instant photography, launching a seriesof pioneering cameras and film formats. These inspired generations of artists, including Andy Warhol, Helmut Newton, Robert Mapplethorpe, Maripol, Keith Haring and Guy Bourdin. They helped to raise Polaroid to the status of cultural icon.This month, Polaroid Originals, launched the OneStep+ instant analogue camera which brings analogue instant photography up to date, as it can be connected to a smartphone app, enabling a range of effects.In 1943, Land’s three-year-old daughter asked her father why she couldn’t immediately see the photograph he had just taken of her. His first instant camera went on sale for $89.95 in 1948, and became the the template for Polaroid cameras for the next 15 years.Throughout the 50s, the Polaroid empire grew, with products distributed to more than 45 countries. The Polaroid SX-70 camera – the first camera to produce self-developing, colour instant photos – was launched in 1972. Edwin Land also appeared on the cover of Life magazine with his “magic camera”. But, with the swift rise of digital technology eclipsing instant photography by the 2000s, in 2008 Polaroid announced that it was stopping making instant film.After the company’s announcement, a group of enthusiasts stepped in, calling themselves the Impossible Project, to buy the world’s last remaining Polaroid film factory, at Enschede in the Netherlands.Polaroid’s production chain had been abandoned before the Impossible team bought the factory later in 2008. There were no negatives, no dyes and no suppliers to hand. They had to start from scratch, and reinvent the lost recipes for Polaroid film. The company rebranded itself last year as Polaroid Originals after acquiring Polaroid’s brand and intellectual property, and is the only company in the world making film for Polaroid cameras.In its heyday, when Polaroid was producing 5,000 cameras a day, the Enschede factory produced more than 50m film packs per year and employed many people in the city of Enschede. Several employees who started at the plant in the 1970s still work there. Andrew Billen, head of global manufacturing at Polaroid Originals, explains some of the key processes in producing Polaroid film.First, the foil that will carry the developing fluid is prepared. A red dye is applied, which is a kind of semi-permanent adhesive. This allows the paste to remain protected from the air, but will ensure that the pod ruptures correctly when the film is ejecting from the camera, thereby setting off the development process.  Then the  foil is slit into the exact width needed to make sachet of chemical developing paste called a “pod”.Depending on the type of negative, a recipe of chemicals is weighed out and placed in a large mixing vessel. It is then heated and blended. The paste is then pumped out into smaller drums ready for the next stage.The foil is run through a machine where a very small, exact quantity of the developing paste is added then heat sealed into the pod. Pods are loaded into metal trays, which are then transported to the film assembly machines to eventually be laminated to each inidual photo frame.Rolls of negative are fed through machines with very sharp circular knives, cut to size and then wound on to cardboard cores ready to be loaded into the film assembly machines.Negative materials are light sensitive, so they need to be cut in complete darkness. A special machine is required and its operators wear night-vision googles. Non-light-sensitive materials  are cut on a similar machine in the lightTo make the film cassettes,  black plastic granules are fed into an injection moulding machine, heated until they melt, then injected into a mould cavity. The plastic is then quickly cooled and the  cassette is ejected on to a conveyor. Cassettes are then transported to the film assembly machines.In the final stage, the  border mask and sheet are fed into the assembly machine. Here, in darkness, they are joined to the light-sensitive negative.After going through a series of cutting, folding and laminating processes, a developer pod is fixed to each frame. A stack of eight finished frames is then inserted into a plastic cassette together with a metal spring and (sometimes) a battery. A card known as a “dark slide” is then added to the top of the packs to prevent light corrupting the negative, then the finished plastic cassette is welded shut. The finished pack is inserted into a foil pouch which goes into a cardboard box.The machines – installed in the 1970s – are completely analogue. Operating and maintaining them requires a great deal of skill and take years to learn. Operators will occasionally need to enter the machine and work for short periods of time in complete darkness. They do this without night-vision googles,  completely by feel.The factory also purchases vintage Polaroid cameras from all over the world. These are cleaned, repaired and tested. Many date from the 1970s, and spare parts have to come from donor cameras as new spares are not available.In the 80s, built-in flash and point-and-shoot capability quickly became one of the most iconic and recognisable Polaroid features. These developments were followed by the introduction of wide-format film for use in professional settings such as medical examinations and police investigations. The 80s also brought a surge of influential users into the world of Polaroid, with artists and photographers such as Mary Ellen Mark, David Hockney, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring and Sarah Moon. More recently, artists including Ryan McGinley and Nobuyoshi Araki have continued to be inspired by the Polaroid creative tradition.The 80th anniversary of Edwin Land’s original Polaroid company was on 13 September 2017. The date also marked the renaming of the Impossible Project as Polaroid Originals. The Polaroid Originals OneStep+ camera, launched this month by Polaroid Originals, connects smartphones via bluetooth to an app to access creative tools such as double exposure, light-painting features, plus remote trigger and manual modes. The app also permits use of a secondary portrait lens for close-ups. The new device also has a flash and long-lasting rechargeable battery.

Climb every mountain and agreement is somewhere up there, will be the reassuring message from her ”few minutes over dinner” address to the 27 EU leaders. Only when – or if – she survives contact with her party will they put her impossible demands through the wringer.Every path looks blocked, every likely or unlikely deal set to be voted down in parliament. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, says Labour will vote down any deal that crosses its six red lines. Remember those were all drawn from promises the Brexiteers made in the referendum campaign. That includes their pledge to keep the “exact same benefits” of the single market and customs union. If that’s impossible, so were all the fantasies sold to voters.Labour, gathering in Liverpool this weekend, faces its own great conundrums. Here’s its choice: it could emerge as the one party that can rescue the country from the morass the Tories have plunged us into, the one clear route out of both Brexit and austerity. Or it could descend into a hornets’ nest of internal strife incomprehensible to voters it needs to win over. A party at war over changing the rules to make every MP face an open contest at every election, obliging obedience to their local party, is a terrible look. It’s a rum democracy that refuses to propose US-style open primaries where local voters choose their candidate – the way the excellent Sarah Wollaston was selected in Totnes. Cracks run through the party, with new splits among Momentum people, and between Momentum and the unions, over new rules for selecting the leader.Nor is there unity among non-Corbynites, ranging from a tiny handful who might split, to a large soft-left of many hues who only coalesce when respected MPs come under assault from the hard left. Chris Williamson, witch-finder general, stirring up enmity in his threatening “roadshow” tour of seats of MPs he thinks insufficiently loyal to the leader, may not be organised by the leadership, but he could have been stopped. It did step in when Canterbury’s Rosie Duffield risked a no-confidence vote for attending an antisemitism rally: outrage at threats to a very popular victor of an unexpected seat saw them shut down within hours. But she was left shattered, considering her future in politics – as are many others, distraught at the bile flowing through their party.In his speech, let’s hear Jeremy Corbyn say something like this: “I will stand for no more vendettas against those who didn’t choose me as leader. Anyone using #JC4PM to abuse other Labour people, you don’t do that in my name. We are always a broad church – I know it better than anyone – and as a broad church, not as narrow sectarians, we will win.” That would be wise peacemaking, when any anti-Corbynites mad enough to split may vanish into the wilderness, but could still prevent a Labour victory.Here’s the question for Corbyn: after a disastrous summer of feuding over antisemitism, will Labour spend the week on display as a nasty party energised by who controls its own meaningless citadels of power – or a serious party heading for real power?Internal ructions are of Labour’s own devising, but it was never Labour’s fault that Brexit was destined to cause it agonies: how does it please its voters in Hampstead and Hull? Finally, a path through is emerging. As Brexit destroys the Tories – every deal, let alone no deal, looking worse than the next – this is Labour’s moment to step up as national saviour.More motions calling for a people’s vote have been put to the conference than for any other issue, mostly from Momentum-backed constituencies. The leadership clings to the formula that when all Brexit options fail in parliament, Labour wants an election. Well, of course it does, but even if the Tories are crazy, the one thing they won’t do is gift an election to Labour. So far, Labour and the unions have put the people’s vote “on the table”. The conference has this chance to turn it into Labour’s first option.Nervous Labour shadow cabinet members tell me the time isn’t right. Although 100 constituencies have swung from Brexit to remain, the polls are still not flowing fast enough. What if they declare for a democratic vote, and there is an election? A new Labour government would be forced into a deeply unwanted referendum. But there won’t be an election. Better by far to lead the upsurge of support for a popular vote that is coming from left and right of the party. The Tories have made such a mess of Brexit that “let the people decide” should be an easy message.To all who say it’s an undemocratic rerun, here are some good analogies. If a trade union leader calls a ballot and members vote to strike, when he negotiates with the bosses he brings them back a possible deal: he doesn’t impose it, but puts it back to the vote. A GP says you need an operation and sends you to a consultant, who, being more expert, gives you odds of success and reckons it will do more harm than good: you would change your mind, wouldn’t you? If you agree to buy a house, before you complete you have it surveyed. If the surveyor finds foundations sinking, dry rot in the attic and dodgy title deeds, you change your mind. Well, the Brexit surveys are in and each looks grimmer than the last.Let’s play optimistic politics. Corbyn should say: “We gave them every chance to produce the Brexit they promised. The endgame is here, but their Brexit promises have vanished. Now only a people’s vote can restore public trust – and only Labour can protect the country against Brexit damage.” That’s the victory path. Can he do that?For any delegates at the conference tempted by factional warfare, just keep focused on the prospect of a second decade of Torydom. Sajid Javid – regarded as a “moderate” – regaled the last cabinet meeting with a 10-minute leadership pitch worthy of his Ayn Rand spirit-guide. He called for “shock-and-awe” tax cuts for business, deregulation of workers’ rights, abolishing automatic enrolment in pension schemes and scrapping environment controls.That should knock sense into any Labour sectarians. So too should the success John McDonnell has had in recent weeks laying out policies and principles with the vigour of a man who seriously wants to win. Good to see him espouse the long-needed Robin Hood tax, which Britain has blocked the EU from imposing on financial transactions. He is making surprising friends: Lord O’Neill (ex-Goldman Sachs chief economist) told the Sunday Times: “I find myself struggling to be that scared by the prospect of a Corbyn government. They have captured the mood of the times.” The goal is wide open – if Labour avoids being its own worst enemy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7e3afeb5ede4c23517a6fab0ae456304997e404/433_0_4422_2654/master/4422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d41535853e6d7e1c3ee74d235308ce2","title":"universities glasgow slavery pasts legacy","story":"Pity our universities. They have become globalised into a competitive market, each one’s brand resting on the depth of its history, the accomplishments of its alumni, and the integrity of its intellectual rigour. What happens when these very features turn out to be in conflict? Take the University of Glasgow, for example, one of whose most historic figures, a former student and rector, went on to use his education to assist in the lucrative tax affairs of the slave trade. It’s hard to ignore the story of Robert Cunninghame Graham, receiver-general in late 18th century Jamaica, and owner of numerous slaves.We often hear about the role prominent members of the university played in the abolition of the slave trade. But on this, Glasgow has decided to take the intellectually honest path, acknowledging, exploring and owning the fact that Cunninghame Graham was one of their own. He married Anne Taylor, the sister of Simon Taylor, one of the most powerful slave owners and good friend to Admiral Horatio Nelson, who – as it is apparently still controversial to remember in England – expressed his support for Taylor’s line of work. Both Cunninghame Graham and Taylor had sex with, and – since relations between slave owners and enslaved women on their plantations were characterised by extreme imbalance and abuse – by definition probably raped these women. And in a final irony, Cunninghame Graham donated part of his wealth to establish a university prize for the best student work on political liberty.It’s an irony not unlike that characterising the legacy of Cecil Rhodes, who channelled some of his profits from black dispossession and economic exploitation into student scholarships. It’s a little known fact that when Harvard graduate Alain Locke finally became the first black person to win a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford in 1907, he did not complete his degree, affected by the traumatic racism he experienced at the hands of white Rhodes scholars from the US south.He went on to become one of the most important African American figures of all time, still referred to today as the “dean of the Harlem Renaissance”. Neither the basic fact of his existence, nor the troubled history of his studies, is remotely hinted at in any of the tour material at Oxford, so much so that one author wrote a book specifically to address it. Unlike their British counterparts, US universities have already started to redress the erasure of the stories that have been hidden from us – most notably Georgetown University, whose slavery archive has sought to trace the impact of selling 272 slaves owned by the Jesuit priests who ran it, to pay off debts in 1838. That’s partly because America’s history is harder to hide, and so has forced it to go further in revealing its legacy. Britain is, by contrast, hampered by a comfortable but misplaced sense of distance. It’s often said that the Caribbean is Britain’s Deep South – the British territory where enslavement, exploitation and racial segregation, as brutal as anything that existed on American soil, took place at the hands of British people, lining British pockets. But distance facilitates denial, and denial has deepened into amnesia.What to do about it now? Some aspects of the slave trade are at least quantifiable. The University of Glasgow has been able to put an estimate on the amount it benefited – between £16.7m and £198m in today’s prices. Its response is a programme of “reparative justice”, including the establishment of a new centre for the study of slavery and a memorial to the enslaved, and the renaming of buildings. This is progress, but for the descendants of the enslaved, it’s hardly “40 acres and a mule” – the reparations once promised to African Americans after the American civil war.The question of how different American society would look today if that promise had been kept remains the subject of heated debate in the US, often chaired and hosted by universities and their departments of African American studies. We in the UK do not have comparable departments devoted to understanding Britain’s role in slavery and empire.This is our bind. Without other universities willing to join Glasgow in contributing to scholarship on the legacy of slavery and economic racism, amnesia and ignorance deaden the debate. Yet a fear of that very debate is preventing institutions such as universities from acknowledging their history in the first place.So the University of Glasgow should be applauded for breaking through the paralysis of fear and denial. It’s no coincidence perhaps that this is a city that could more than most invoke the preferred excuse to avoid talk of race altogether – the “only class matters” trope. The city is often cited as an example of the intergenerational and persistent nature of white, working-class poverty. Only three-quarters of boys born in Glasgow, for example, can\u0026nbspexpect to live to 65. Perhaps it’s this very familiarity with structural unfairness that has made it less fragile and hesitant when it comes to asking hard questions about race in the past, as well.What Glasgow’s actions will reveal, I think, is that when an institution’s mission is supposed to be learning, refusing to learn relevant parts of its own legacy is not an option. These conversations about Britain’s history, and how it’s shaped contemporary society and identity, are happening. Avoiding them is a luxury universities\u0026nbspcan\u0026nbspno\u0026nbsplonger afford."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8445a23ee8c9079a75e1a3848a3eda4268f5a94/0_64_1250_750/master/1250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96e10c6fb403c850585c68ee05b53acd","title":"pimples in rise of acne positivity movement","story":"It was on a family holiday that Kali Kushner discovered, abruptly, just how others viewed her skin. “At the end of the day I washed off my makeup,” she recalls. “My nephew said: ‘Why is your face so dirty?’ It took me a minute to realise he saw my foundation as a ‘clean face’ and acne as dirt.”Soon after, Kushner, 23, from Cincinnati, Ohio, began documenting her struggle with acne on the Instagram account @myfacestory – her experience with the drug Accutane, dermarolling, makeup, scarring, hyperpigmentation, alongside all the ways people have responded to her acne, from her husband, who has been steadfastly supportive, to the traffic police officer who assumed she was a junkie. To her surprise, people began following. Today, with more than 50,000 followers, she makes up part of the growing acne positivity movement.After years of oppressive aesthetic perfection, acne positivity is a drive for people to be more open about their skin problems, from the occasional spot to full-blown cystic acne. It joins recent moves to celebrate the many and varied appearances of our skin – from vitiligo to freckles and stretch marks – but also seeks to educate those who still believe that acne is a problem for the unwashed and unhealthy.Many trace the movement back to the British blogger Em Ford, who in 2015 posted a YouTube video called You Look Disgusting. It showed her both in full makeup and bare-faced with her acne visible, as a succession of comments people had posted about her skin sprung up around her: “WTF is wrong with her face?”, “I can’t even look at her”, “Ewww, gross, horrible, ugly …”. In the first week alone, it amassed 10 million views. Ford, whose YouTube channel My Pale Skin now has more than one million subscribers, will shortly launch You Look Disgusting 2.0.Others have followed, including the Colorado Instagrammer Hailey Wait and the British beauty blogger Kadeeja Khan, as well as a host of celebrities – from Kylie Jenner promoting her favourite spot treatment to Justin Bieber’s Instagram post that claimed “Pimples are in” and Lorde’s sardonic replies to people giving her unsolicited skincare advice. Last year, Teen Vogue launched the inaugural Acne awards.Kushner developed acne in high school. “Whiteheads, blackheads, the usual stuff.” It was around the age of 20 that she developed adult cystic acne. “It was hard. And extremely painful. I had no idea what was going with my skin. Nothing worked. Or if it did, it didn’t for long.”She grew increasingly socially anxious, certain that everyone she met was staring at her skin. “One time I remember I was talking to my friend in class and started laughing at a joke she told me. As I was laughing, a cyst burst open and started bleeding down my face. It was horrifyingly embarrassing. I ran out of the classroom and didn’t come back for the next two weeks.”Dr Bav Shergill of the British Association of Dermatologists says that acne “often affects people without much power in society, such as adolescents”. He tells of a US study in which participants were shown a selection of photographs of high-school students with skin problems, as well as photographs of the same students with their acne airbrushed out, and asked for their impressions. The results, Shergill says, showed that “as soon as you have any disfigurement on your face, you get viewed as an introverted nerd”. Corrinne, an educational psychologist from Folkestone, turned 40 in August. To celebrate, she visited the Mac Cosmetics counter for a makeover. Sitting before the makeup artist, she felt horribly, painfully exposed. “I couldn’t make eye contact,” she says. “To sit there with my face naked, I felt so vulnerable.”Every morning, Corrinne dedicates an hour to the process of getting ready, with the bulk of that time set aside for makeup. She will use a base, foundation, concealer, then more foundation, then powder, then a spray to fix it. It is not an attempt to look unfailingly glamorous: “I’m just trying to get myself to a baseline to face the world.”It has been like this since she was 14. At school, she would wear makeup so thick it was “almost a mask”. She hated to be seen in daylight and would use a tiny vanity mirror rather than something that showed her whole face or full length. She spent an hour and a half getting ready for school each morning, and at lunchtime she would go home to reapply her foundation. At breaktimes, she would head straight to the toilets to check her concealer. Comments were made that she says shaped her. “I remember someone said I’d put so much make-up on, it looked like Polyfilla.“Without social media, it was isolating, lonely, secretive. I thought I was acne. I thought I wasn’t bigger than that.”In her 20s, she met a friend who had also suffered from severe acne. To find someone who understood so fully, who would discuss it openly and felt no shame, was hugely helpful to Corrinne – it was a taste, perhaps, of today’s acne positive attitude. “I wish we’d had that movement when I was 14,” she says. “I think it’s a fantastic thing.”When Kushner began her Instagram account in 2015, it was solely for herself – a private page to track her progress on Accutane. “I wasn’t really interested in sharing my journey at first because I didn’t realise that others were going through the same thing,” she explains. “I wanted to document my skin and side-effects so that I could look back on it and see how far I’ve come.”When she made her page public, it was an act of defiance. “If anything, my account was a rebellion against the typical beauty blogger accounts at the time,” she says. “There was no curation taking place, no filters, angles, and certainly no Photoshop. I would take out my phone, take a picture, think of a caption within four or five minutes and post it. It was and always has been about keeping it real. It was a call against stereotypical standards of beauty, saying that you don’t need XYZ to be beautiful. All you need is you.”This attitude has now spread to other previously flawless areas of social media. Jessica Olie is a fitness guru known for her Let’s Start Yoga ebook and an Instagram account in which she is often photographed holding yoga poses in charming locations around the globe. A year or so ago, Olie’s account broke its carefully calibrated perfection in favour of a new kind of honesty, documenting her orce, her father’s illness and her problems with her skin.Olie suffered from teenage acne, exacerbated by the constant exposure to chlorine as a competitive swimmer, and in her late teens was prescribed the pill. Five months after she stopped taking the contraceptive last year, her skin went “haywire” – worse, she says, than when she was a teenager.For someone who makes a living out of looking enviably, radiantly healthy, posting honestly about her skin problems came with a degree of risk. “If someone said: ‘You’re supposed to be healthy, why is your skin bad?’, I’d tell them just because you’re healthy it doesn’t mean your skin is good, and just because your skin is good it doesn’t mean you’re healthy.”And the pursuit of perfection can be wearisome. “I think I was fed up of not feeling pretty or beautiful enough because I had a few pimples. I looked at my friends who didn’t wear makeup and I realised when they had pimples they still looked beautiful.” Today, she posts pictures and videos of herself makeup-free, her skin mid-flare or masked by splodges of spot cream. “People put you on a pedestal, they think everything in your life is perfect, so it’s nice when people on social media reveal there are things they don’t feel confident about.”Kushner, too, has felt a shift in attitudes. “Honestly, there hasn’t been as much backlash as you would think,” she says. “At first, definitely. People will always have something negative to say no matter what you do or post or say, so that’s important to keep in mind. But now I feel like our little community has been able to educate those who were once ignorant on the subject. It feels like a more understanding and accepting place than it was four years ago. I only hope that it continues to grow and the community continues to shine its light.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/344b4ed06a5be7a94d229c9910e32ce66e366026/154_449_4870_2922/master/4870.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1e1671fb2b4a6fcf499d492d361381e","title":"richard quinn offers fashion education with lfw show","story":"After the Queen last season, this time it was schoolchildren the designer wanted to impressHow do you follow the coup of having the Queen front row at your fashion show? That was the question Richard Quinn had to answer at London fashion week, the first since Her Majesty watched on in February. For his third show, Quinn instead filled the front row with schoolchildren, from Quinn’s former school and sixth form – plus students from Central Saint Martins – who took up the space more usually occupied by celebrities and fashion editors.The students watched a show on Tuesday that had the drama to intrigue potential future designers. It was soundtracked by an orchestra and a film of thunder and lightning was projected on the walls. The first model wore a black tulle concoction, with black velvet leggings and a black version of the balaclavas in Quinn’s previous collection. The following outfits showed Quinn to be developing in the tradition of John Galliano and Alexander McQueen. Like them, he favours drama, romance and glamour. With print a running thread, there were flapper dresses with marabou layers, debutante ballroom dresses with a feel of The Crown, bright kaftans fit for a 70s-era heiress and floral 80s party frocks with matching tights.Pupils from St Thomas More comprehensive school in Greenwich, south-east London, were impressed. Isabella Marenhi, 14, said: “I thought it was really amazing. It reminded me of all four seasons.” Molly Farrell, 14, said: “I kind of thought the same. At the beginning, the dresses looked like raindrops.” Isabella added: “The way the models were walking and the look on their faces was really breathtaking.”In addition to his own label, Quinn manages a print studio in south London. Brands including Charles Jeffrey, JW Anderson, Burberry and Ports 1961 have used the service. The monarch was at his February show to present the designer with the inaugural Queen Elizabeth II award for British design, which focuses on a designer’s talent but also their value to their community. Quinn’s latest show further underlined the fact he was a worthy recipient.Victoria Beckham, who showcased her 10th anniversary collection on the catwalk on Sunday, finished her whirlwind tour of London fashion week on Tuesday by exhibiting her Victoria, Victoria Beckham collection. It included denim inspired by the Instagram account @70sbabes and a print of mountains that took Beckham’s childhood science kit as its jumping-off point. Her own T-shirt read “smile”, an appropriate response to a week in which an Instagram video showed the usually very curated former Spice Girl dancing to Spice up Your Life at a party on Sunday night. “I think we’ve proven this week that fashion didn’t steal my smile,” she said. “We have a sense of humour, personality and we smile a lot.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

If global politics had left you in any doubt, the commotion caused by Mark Wahlberg last week confirmed that we are truly in the age of the strongman. The publication of the actor’s daily routine – which includes two gym sessions, six meals and one hour cultivating his torso in a cryogenic recovery chamber – confirmed what many of us had suspected for some time: a man’s cultural worth these days can be accurately gauged by the circumference of his biceps.Telltale evidence had already arrived last year, when the eighth film in the Fast and Furious series shattered the global box-office record for an opening weekend, taking an absurd half a billion dollars in three days. That would be the Fast and Furious series fronted by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Vin Diesel, two men whose pre-Hollywood years were spent as pro wrestler and nightclub bouncer respectively, and whose current whey-powered incarnations make pipsqueaks of their former selves.Together, this trinity of weights-room warriors have racked up nearly $10bn worth of ticket sales in the US alone. If you were feeling unsure about a society that chooses a showbiz star as its president, how about one whose cultural icons look more like cartoon characters than people? Strange times indeed – made even stranger by the fact that we’ve been here before.If the 70s’ action icons were Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman and Charles Bronson – hard-drinking, normal-looking guys whose morals were strewn with shades of grey – the following decade flipped the formula: you may have rightly wondered how Arnie and co got so pumped, but you never had reason to question their cause. And they were well-oiled in only the most literal sense.A cursory scan of some video-box taglines from the era (samples include “Crime is a disease. Meet the cure” and “Heroes never die. They just reload”) give a basic impression of the level of nuance on offer. Generally speaking, these movies opted for the profane over the profound. In an age when American inidualism reigned supreme, these were straightforward stories of one man saving the day. And “man” is the operative word – it was the actors’ hulking physiques, torsos bared at every turn, that were the stars of the show. These films might have drooled over firearms, but not half as much as they drooled over human arms.Fast-forward three decades, as a gun-toting Wahlberg looms over us from roadside billboards, and it’s tempting to conclude that we’ve come full circle. Why the renewed urge to thrust these oversized muscle-men on to our screens? It’s almost as if America is trying to make up for something. After all, the goliaths of the 80s were largely there to prove a point in the wake of Vietnam: Rambo, Commando, Predator and the rest all delivered thinly veiled restagings of what had been a disastrous war, only this time America’s cigar-chomping heroes emerged from the jungle triumphant.There are no wars to refight these days, but that’s not to say Uncle Sam doesn’t still harbour an inferiority complex or two. Perhaps in an era of waning US economic clout – and vanishing political dignity, thanks to you-know-who – Wahlberg and co are here to compensate. To make America pump weights again.Or perhaps that’s too easy a reading. Because it’s not quite right to label the current crop of strongmen as spiritual heirs to their 80s predecessors: while Schwarzenegger and Stallone were all about the bloodshed and bravado, these guys tend to deliver their heroism with a nod and a wink, even a hug. The screen personas honed by Diesel and Johnson in particular are deliberately goofy and warm-hearted (if there’s one thing the Fast and Furious films adore more than a city-decimating street-race, it’s an earnest heart-to-heart over a couple of cold Coronas), although that probably says less about the current zeitgeist than the scramble for mass appeal that has taken over Marvel-era Hollywood. They just don’t exterminate ’em like they used to.Not often, anyway. Wahlberg’s series of save-the-day tales made with Peter Berg are perhaps the closest in spirit to the alpha-dog adventures of the 80s. Mile 22 is the latest of these and you sense that the film, whose plot follows an elite paramilitary task force escorting a shady south Asian operative back to US soil, will have Stallone and co nodding approvingly, trigger-fingers stiffening with excitement.Either way, we can safely say that America’s appetite for these herculean heroes endures. Which counts as mission accomplished for the men of yesteryear, whose simple ambitions were laid out by John Rambo all the way back in 1985: “All I want is for our country to love us as much as we love it! That’s all I want!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5798a817831414d4ca0786fc95675e74793d842/163_65_2034_1220/master/2034.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd36c2c2fbc0f7dc8de2c674680b69db","title":"barcelona psv eindhoven champions league match report","story":"Lionel Messi scored the eighth Champions League hat-trick of his career as 10-man Barcelona eased to an emphatic 4-0 victory over PSV Eindhoven in Group B.The Argentinian was once again in imperious form as the hosts overcame a low-key start to cruise past their Dutch opponents, with Ousmane Dembélé also getting on the scoresheet.The only blot on another great night at the Camp Nou was Samuel Umtiti’s 79th-minute sending-off for a second bookable offence after a foul on PSV winger Hirving Lozano. By that point Messi’s magic had already decided the contest, but PSV will be left to rue their failure to make more of a bright start.When Messi opened the scoring in the 32nd minute, curling a free-kick into the top corner after Dembélé had been pulled down, it was the home side’s first shot on target.PSV had started with confidence and had the first real chance when Gastón Pereiro fired over the bar in the eighth minute. Barça looked lacklustre with the exception of Philippe Coutinho, whose tireless probing almost led to the opener when he just failed to steer home a Luis Suárez cross.Ivan Rakitic had a shot blocked in the box but it was a largely frustrating first quarter of the game for the hosts, while PSV enjoyed by far the better of the chances and threatened on the counterattack. Messi’s opening effort changed the momentum immediately, with Rakitic coming close with two more chances prior to half-time.After the break, Messi stepped up his tempo, driving a shot which PSV keeper Jeroen Zoet had to fingertip away, while Zoet also had to be alert to collect a poor backpass under threat from Suárez.The Uruguay forward missed a chance to make it 2-0 from a cross by the excellent Coutinho, who also brought another fine save out of Zoet just before the hour mark. Dembélé finally doubled Barcelona’s lead in stunning fashion in the 74th minute when he burst on to the end of a Coutinho pass, danced past defender Daniel Schwab, and unleashed an unstoppable shot into the top corner from outside the box.Three minutes later it was all over as Messi added his second, finishing off after being put in by a clever lob from Rakitic. Umtiti’s red card came too late to affect proceedings and Messi added yet another hat-trick to his Champions League list when he finished superbly in the 87th minute after a clever backheel from Suárez."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec1be7361a20e74f4da683599dfffc712ab9c542/0_97_1378_827/master/1378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f41709524906ee3fb6801e47b5beb78","title":"champions league liverpool paris st germain match report","story":"It was the second minute of stoppage time when the ball left Roberto Firmino’s foot, when Jürgen Klopp set off on his victory run amid a crescendo of noise inside Anfield. And in that moment, even though these are only the early stages of the Champions League, perhaps we learned some more about last season’s beaten finalists.We knew they played their home games with fearlessness. We knew they attacked in numbers, that they went for the jugular and that nobody, but nobody, would persuade them to change that policy. But now we can safely say the modern Liverpool have powers of endurance to go with all their other gifts.Another team might have lost their way after that moment in the 83rd minute when Kylian Mbappé decided it was time to introduce himself to Anfield properly – inside the penalty area, with the ball on his right foot, and burying his shot so confidently it felt necessary to remind yourself this player, holding the keys to the football universe, is a boy of 19.Briefly, Liverpool even toyed with the idea of losing a game they had once led 2-0. Only briefly, however. Klopp’s men quickly shook their heads clear, rousing themselves for one final onslaught and conjuring up the winner after harrying Mbappé into a mistake in his own half. Firmino, a 72nd-minute substitute, had started on the bench because of the eye injury he suffered against Tottenham on Saturday. He celebrated his winner by cupping the affected eye – yet there was nothing wrong with his vision when he beat Alphonse Areola with a low diagonal shot from right to left.That goal, and the match as a whole, should be added to the growing file of evidence that Anfield, without any exaggeration, may have legitimate claims to be thought of as the most difficult place for any team to visit in the Champions League right now.Another team might have chosen to play with restraint given the opposition included Mbappé on the right, Neymar on the left, Edinson Cavani through the middle and Angel Di María never too far away. Not Liverpool, though.The team in red played as if affronted by the suggestion that the opposition had the better selection of attacking riches. Liverpool did not reach the final last season with conservatism and, once again, they could be seen trying to rush the opposition players off their feet, swarming forward and, in the first half, rekindling the thought it is amazing how many times European opponents concede a goal in front of the Kop, become unnerved and quickly let in another one.Perhaps an argument could be made that Liverpool should have closed down the game after establishing a two-goal lead, 36 minutes in, courtesy of Daniel Sturridge’s header and a penalty from James Milner.Sturridge was making his first Champions League start and opened the scoring, on the half hour, by heading in Andy Robertson’s cross. At 2-1 he missed what was probably an easier chance, failing to get any power with a header. Overall, however, he can reflect on a satisfying evening’s work, no matter that Firmino was still, ultimately, the hero.PSG were certainly rattled during the period in the first half when, six minutes after going behind, Juan Bernat’s challenge on Georginio Wijnaldum gave away the penalty. It was not a wild challenge, just a risky and slightly unnecessary one. Milner, one of several outstanding performers for Liverpool, slotted the penalty past Areola, aiming to the goalkeeper’s left.Even at that stage, however, with Wijnaldum and Jordan Henderson also excelling, there was always a lurking danger. Neymar, for starters. The Brazilian began the game with a body swerve to glide away from Trent Alexander-Arnold and then a slaloming run past, in order, Henderson, Sadio Mané and Milner.The crowd enjoyed it later in the first half when Neymar was flattened by Milner’s hard but fair challenge and, again, when Mané went past the Brazilian with some showboating of his own. But it was also clear PSG had the personnel to believe a feat of escapology was possible.Their comeback began five minutes before half-time. Di María supplied the cross from the left and Cavani’s attempt at an overhead kick connected with only thin air. The ball bounced off Robertson and Thomas Meunier, venturing forward from his right-back position, hooked a splendid left-foot volley past Allison.Until the equaliser, there were only fleeting glimpses of Mbappé’s menace and only one occasion early in the second half that he managed to get past the quick, alert Robertson. Di María’s link-up play with Neymar was a prominent feature. As a front three, however, Neymar, Cavani and Mbappé still looked a work in progress.Liverpool were determined not to sit on their lead and there were prolonged celebrations after Mohamed Salah stabbed in a loose ball, believing he had made it 3-1, only for the Turkish referee, Cuneyt Cakir, to signal that he had not missed Sturridge’s studs going into Areola’s midriff after all.It was the correct decision and Sturridge’s missed chance to make it 3-1 looked like being a costly lapse when Salah gave away the ball in the buildup to Mbappé’s goal, with Neymar’s initial run opening up the chance for the French World Cup winner.Yet Liverpool still found a way to win, even with Salah being substituted, and created an unhappy sense of deja vu for Thomas Tuchel, the PSG manager who also lost in stoppage time when he came here with Borussia Dortmund in the Europa League quarter-finals in 2016."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68a7d76aeea0228d5723e89bed8a69d9f2e6dd66/117_110_3302_1981/master/3302.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4db7eb95c46108ba985dbda07d140445","title":"champions league roundup atletico win at monaco","story":"• Atlético come back from 1-0 down to win 2-1• Borussia Dortmund grab late victory at Club BruggeAtlético Madrid battled their way back from a goal down to pull off a confidence-boosting 2-1 win at Monaco in Group A, a defiant response to their poor start to the domestic season.Atlético have won only one La Liga game and their problems at home looked to have followed them into Europe when some haphazard defending allowed Samuel Grandsir to score from close range in the 18th minute. Diego Simeone’s side continued to struggle and it took a flying save from Jan Oblak to prevent Jean-Eudes Aholou from doubling Monaco’s lead with a venomous long-range strike.Diego Costa gave the visitors a lifeline just after the half-hour mark by controlling a clever through-ball from Antoine Griezmann and providing a cool finish. The goal provided the encouragement Atlético needed and they responded by dominating the rest of the half, eventually clinching the winner on the stroke of half-time when the defender José Giménez headed home from a corner, helped by sloppy goalkeeping from Danijel Subasic.The USA forward Christian Pulisic came off the bench on his 20th birthday to grab a late goal and seal a 1-0 win for Borussia Dortmund at Club Brugge.A game of few clear-cut chances looked to be heading for a stalemate before Brugge defender Matej Mitrovic’s clearance looped off the outstretched leg of Pulisic and into the net after 85 minutes. Dortmund had dominated possession at the Jan Breydel Stadium, especially in the second half, and ended a run of eight games without a victory in the Champions League. They handed a debut to 18-year-old Jadon Sancho, the youngest English player to make his bow in the Champions League for a team outside England.Red Star Belgrade ground out a 0-0 home draw against Napoli as Milan Borjan made a flurry of telling saves in a pulsating Group C encounter. Napoli dominated the opening half and twice went close to taking the lead as Lorenzo Insigne struck the crossbar and Borjan denied Arkadiusz Milik from close range with a fine reflex save.Several last-gasp tackles early in the second half kept Red Star in the match and they threatened for the first time in the 58th minute when Napoli keeper David Ospina palmed away a fizzing low shot from the half-time substitute Dusan Jovancic. Napoli could not find a way through as Red Star closed ranks, drawing loud cheers from their fans after salvaging a point with a gritty performance.Schalke marked their return to the Champions League after a three-year absence with a 1-1 draw at home to Porto in their Group D opener to earn some respite after a poor start to the Bundesliga season.Schalke went into the game having lost all three domestic league matches but Breel Embolo put the home side ahead in the 64th minute before Otávio levelled with Porto’s second penalty 11 minutes later. Porto got a 13th minute penalty when Alex Telles’ deep throw-in landed on Naldo’s arm. But Ralf Fährmann picked the right corner and spectacularly palmed away Telles’ effort. But another Naldo foul in the box gave the Portuguese side the chance to level from the penalty spot and Otávio this time sent Fährmann the wrong way to grab a point for the away side.In the other Group D match Galatasaray cruised past Lokomotiv Moscow 3-0 with goals from Garry Rodrigues, Eren Derdiyok and a stoppage-time penalty from Selcuk Inan. The hosts were rarely threatened by the Russian champions but ended the game with 10 men following the dismissal of Badou Ndiaye for a second booking three minutes from time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16725cf2e1ba06bb59591504436a4529f7380e46/64_36_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=817cad105a0dc666d05dd6d199b84ddb","title":"mauricio pochettino accuses reporters disrespect inter tottenham champions league","story":"• Spurs manager loses cool over selection questions• ‘You disrespect the players … it’s so painful to hear’Mauricio Pochettino accused journalists of disrespecting his players after Tottenham opened their Champions League campaign with a 2-1 defeat at Internazionale.Spurs led through Christian Eriksen and the manager described the performance as having been the best of the season. But there would be a sting in the tail, with Mauro Icardi equalising with a sensational long-range volley after 85 minutes and Matías Vecino stealing victory in stoppage-time with a header following a corner.It represented the latest set-piece concession after the lapses in the defeats by Watford and Liverpool, and Pochettino could be further annoyed by Tottenham’s inability to take a clutch of chances at 1-0. Harry Kane had also missed a clear chance at 0-0.Pochettino lost his cool when he was asked whether the result might have been different had he not rested the key defenders Kieran Trippier and Toby Alderweireld.“You disrespect the players that tonight showed better qualities than the opponent,” he told his questioner.“When my decision is to play with 11, you must respect my decision because I am the manager. It’s so painful to hear when some people are not here and you judge in that way.”The manager cut a frustrated figure on the sidelines at the end, especially as he was convinced it was Spurs’ best display of the campaign.“At 1-0, the result is always open and the problem was we didn’t kill the game. Samir Handanovic was fantastic in goal in some situations. Of course, the home fans were unbelievable after the equaliser and they helped their team to win the game. We need to improve with some situations.“I understand football and I understand tough periods can arrive. After our win at Manchester United, I said: ‘Be careful.’ And afterwards, a tough period arrived, starting at Watford. The most important thing is to be strong and we are strong. We’ve shown tonight we will be the same as in the past.“We have quality and I started to see good signs the team is coming back. We showed great personality. We controlled Inter Milan in the San Siro, a difficult place. We showed big character and we were unlucky not to keep the result we deserved.”The defender Serge Aurier said: “I don’t know what the problem is with us defending set pieces and every time you get in the lead, you must stay focused. That has cost us the game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b28c3c77d86f3aac3f67dc55625da170be9208bd/136_292_2943_1765/master/2943.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2aa21235e07b8f437fb06dc27e63b89c","title":"liverpool v psg champions league live","story":"Roberto Firmino came off the bench to give Liverpool maximum points after PSG looked to have snatched an unlikely drawBecause we’re heroically fair-minded at the , here are the player ratings from France Football:Jürgen Klopp: “It was really important that we started the game as we did. They changed the system a little, bringing Neymar on to the left wing and playing Di Maria in the half-space. Not a bad idea. You had to really keep your focus. But we did really well, covered a lot of yards and closed all the spaces … and we used the right wing – Neymar is a world class player but he’s not a defender so we tried to use that.As we await word from the mangers, here’s what emailer brandon Dwonch has to say: “One point would have been a disappointment. We set the standard in a tough group. Sloppy goals by both sides. Winning tough games is what is needed for silverware.” In this group’s other match, Red Star Belgrade drew 0-0 at home to Napoli. Here’s a curious thing: the replays on BT show that as Liverpool’s bench celebrate Firmino’s winning goal, Salah, sitting down, flings a plastic water bottle to the ground. Some of you are suggesting via email that he was peeved that it wasn’t him that scored, but perhaps he just hurled the bottle in sheer joy, being too knackered to get up and jump around? Robetson: “I think all the fans and players have been waiting since May for the Champions league to start back. We got off to a good start but then made it hard for ourselves. Bobby came off the bench to score …. to a man we were brilliant.Sturridge” “It’s great to contribute for the team but it’s early days, only one game, so we’re not getting too excited.” The striker also says how pleased he is that Liverpool showed “hard work, determination, all those things the managers talks about and is ingrained in us now.”It’s a fully deserved victory for Liverpool, even they needed a stoppage-time goal by Firmino to atone for the late sloppiness that allowed PSG to equalise. The visitors never matched Liverpool’s intensity, instead relying on ad hoc inidual brilliance to get them off the hook. A super-talented disgrace, they nearly got away with it, but Firmino served justice with a sweet late strike. Liverpool’s biggest names were slightly below par but there were big performances from the likes of Milner, Wijnaldum, Robertson and Alexander-Arnold, and Sturridge made an encouraging return to the starting lineup. But Firmino came off the bench to hit the glory goal. Last year’s runners-up are up and running again.90+2 min: Firmino celebrates by covering his sore eye with one hand, as his team-mates rush over to tell him how happy they are that he was able to overcome that bother to plunder that late goal. Now, can they hold on this time?The Brazilian fires a low shot through lots of bodies and into the net after PSG fail to clear a corner. The substitute has surely won it for Liverpool!90 min: Mané digs out a fine cross from the left. It’s fractionally too high for Firmino. Milner retrieves it on the far side and sends it back into the danger zone. But Silva heads away. 87 min: Mané does well to collect a pass by Robertson outside the PSG box and then sweeps it wide for Alexander-Arnold, whose cross is blocked. 85 min: A superb pass by Neymar splits the Liverpool defence right open. Draxler tries to take advantage but his shot from 18 yards is blocked. Suddenly Liverpool are looking very vulnerable ...PSG land a sucker punch with unwitting help from Salah! Perhaps lulled into a false sense of security by PSG’s indolence, Salah played a loose pass in his own half, presenting the ball to Neymar, who sprinted towards the Liverpool box. He then rolled the ball into Mbappé past a befuddled Van Dijk. Mbappe touch a touch and fired into the net from eight yards! The visitors’ first shot of the second half gives them an equaliser that should not have been possible!83 min: Mané exchanges a one-two with Salah in th ePSg boxes and then dinks the ball over the lunging Kimpembe and dashes down the byline. He tries to lash it into the net from an acute angle but misses.83 min: Milner brings a half to a Neymar scramble with a vital touch at the edge of the Liverpool box. In the last minute or so Neymar has sparked into life ...PSG substitution: Choupo-Moting on Cavani off. 81 min: Foxy touch touch from Neymar to open up a crossing chance for Meunier. Van Dijk makes a good clearance. “You are all over Tuchel but has Klopp improved Liverpool this season?” wonders Bruv. “This season’s football is more solid that stylish. More functional than fantasy.” True, but Leicester and Brighton have caused them more problems than PSG so far.79 min: PSG knock the ball around at a leisurely pace in their own half. Liverpool watch them, perhaps wondering whether this is some hi-falutin’ subterfuge or are the visitors really this lame? It’s as if PSG are trying to live up to the stereotype of bullies who can’t handle it when someone takes the fight to them. They aren’t usually like this so early in the tournament. Then again, they’re up against last season’s finalists.76 min: Another slack pass by PSG in midfield gifts the ball back to the hosts. 74 min: Liverpool take their time in the opposing half, with PSG showing no inclination to intervene. Have they seen the scoreboard?72 min: A liverpool corner is cleared only as far as henderson, who lofts the ball back into the danger zone. Van Dijk helps it on with a header, which runs into the path of Salah, whose shot is deflected wide. Liverpool substitution: Firmino on, Sturridge off. The Englishman leaves to a deserved ovation and the Brazilian enters to one. That third goal for Liverpool is surely on the way ...70 min: Cavani heads a Milner corner out for another one...68 min: Rabiot gives the ball away to Henderson in the centre circle. Liverpool get a counter going. But they overcomplicate it at the edge of the box and let PSG off. But they’re going to get a third here, it’s almost guaranteed. PSG are a super-talented disgrace.66 min: Freekick to Liverpool about 25 yards out. Milner clips a sly one over the wall for the overlapping Alexander-Arnold, who smashes it first time across goals. Silva clears before Salah can tap in from close range.65 min: This is such a patchy display by PSG, If, as Dani Alves says, Tuchel has done much to improve the side’s mentality, he still has a lot more work to do. “Shaqiri is warming up in the manner of a cricketer trying to catch the captain’s eye because he’d like to have a bowl,” observes Marie Meyer. “He and Sturridge were great together in the pre-season, it would be good to see him come on.” There’s a case for taking off Salah, who’s still below par compared to last season. 62 min: Having escaped with two close shaves, there’s still no sign of extra urgency for PSG here. The way things are going, a third goal for Liverpool is looking far more likely than an equaliser by the slightly listless visitors.60 min: Alexander-Arnold moseys down the right again and delivers a perfect cross for Sturridge, who has a free header from seven yards ... and nods tamely at the keeper! another let-off for PSG. Liverpool were well into their celebrations after Salah poked the ball into the net but the referee belatedly whistled to rule out the goal! Presumably the officials have decided that Areola was fouled in the buildup as he tried to snaffle a ball that bounced off Sturridge’s foot. Sturridge lunged at the ball to try to retrieve the situation but caught the keeper on the follow-through.55 min: Buoyed by his goal and perhaps also by that half-time hug from his manager, Sturridge is becoming ever more involved in Liverpool’s attack. He’s showing good strength on the ball and a really lively mind and lithe touch. Frankly, it’s good to see from a player who’s been so bedevilled by injuries. 53 min: Mbappé almost ridicules Henderson and Robertson down the right, tricking his way past both with almost effortless ease. But his cross is cut out with similar ease by Gomez. 52 min: A lovely touch by Sturridge, flipping the ball first-time around the corner to Wijnaldum after being picked ut by Sturridge. But PSG descend quickly on the Dutchman to snuff out the danger.51 min: Robertson launches on long towards Sturridge. But Kimpembe wins it easily. 49 min: Bernat, undeterred by his goof in the first-half that led to the penalty, makes a good challenge on Salah in the PSG box, tidily relieving the forward of the ball and extinguishing a threatening move. 48 min: Sturridge rolls a pass into Salah just inside the box. The Egyptian uses his strength to hold off the defender and lay it back for Sturridge. But Silva intervenes before the striker can get a shot off.47 min: It’s a tame start to the second half. Liverpool stroke the ball about in their own half and PSG let them do so. They’re not going to be coaxed into pressing Liverpool high just yet.46 min: Off we go. Neither team made a substitution during the interval. Here we go again ... the teams are walking back out, with Klopp’s shoulder draped around Sturridge as the manager delivers some last-minute instructions. “Score again” is the gist of it, I imagine. Looking at PSG’s goal again, I should mention that Cavani - in an offside position - tries to connect with the cross before it runs through to Robertson, who inadvertently helped it on to Meunier. That counts as interfering with play and thus the goal should have been ruled out for offside. Liverpool have a deserved lead and can be confident of scoring again in the second half, partly because of the freedom they are getting to attack down the wings. But PSG are certainly not out of this and carry an obvious threat on the break even if their vaunted offensive trio have not really shone. The game hasn’t quite reached the level of quality we’d hoped for but it’s gripping, all the same, and very much in the balance.44 min: Meunier booked for pulling back Mané. 43 min: Alexander-Arnold has enjoyed plenty of space throughout this half because Neymar has no interest in tacking back. It was, in fact, an overhit cross from the right that found it was to Robertson in the buildup to Liverpool’s first goal. Mbappé isn’t doing much defending on the other wide, either. Di Maria swings in a cross from the left. Robertson fails to get a decisive touch, knocking it straight to Meunier, who ks it into the net from nine yards. As we said, this lead is far from safe for Liverpool...36 min: It’s worth reiterating how mindless that tackle was by Bernat. Wijnaldum was looking about as inoffensive as a player can look when in the opposing box, surrounded by opponents and heading the opposite way to goal. There was little need to challenge him, let alone in as desperate a way as Bernat did. Should we put that down as another implosion caused by the intoxicating Anfield atmosphere? The pressure Liverpool are applying? Traditional PSG bottling it, even if Bernat is a newcomer?Milner guides a hard and low shot into the bottom corner past Areola, who went the right way but couldn’t get near it. What a position Liverpool are in now. Not that a two-goal lead can ever be considered safe, as Liverpool fans know well.Bernat takes down Wijnaldum with a daft challenge just inside the box!35 min: Liverpool are caught out by a clever corner routine, as Mbappé peels out of the six-yard box, thereby eluding the attentions of Alexander-Arnold. The corner is delivered quick and low to the striker but he lifts his shot over from nine yards.34 min: An infringement by Milner gives PSG a freekick in a dicey position: about 28 yards out, a little to the left. Neymar steps up ... and blems towards Sturridge, who deflects it out for a corner. 33 min: Having made the first cut, Liverpool are going in for the kill! There’s renewed zip and menace to their play and PSG are being made to wobble at the back, especially after a jagged run into the box just now by Salah.Very little involvement, you say!? The striker made an impact when it mattered most, planting a header past Areola from six yards after being picked out by a sumptuous cross from the left by Robertson! 30 min: Sturridge has had very little involvement so far. 29 min: More unsteadiness from Van Dijk, as he fails to properly clear the ball with Mbappé lurking at the edge of the box. Alexander-Arnold tidies up instead. It seems the threat of Mbappé has rattled Van Dijk, at least momentarily. He’ll need to regain his composure pronto...."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3cde85ebecb07845481723aafdef225a9a9e08b/0_27_3687_2212/master/3687.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b82188a4b76364f420ed31773c885ced","title":"your fathers not your father when dna tests reveal more than you bargained for","story":"Genetic tests are seen as harmless fun. But the secrets they can reveal can split families and leave users traumatisedThe first surprise of Michèle’s DNA test was how much saliva it took. “It was daunting. It took us, like, 20 minutes. And the more we laughed, the harder it was to do.”It was May 2016, and she and her now husband had ordered the kits as very early Christmas presents for themselves. They had been researching their family trees – Michèle had traced her father’s family back as far as the 1600s – and had wanted to test their DNA but had been put off by the cost. They were saving for a fertility treatment and had only recently moved to Florida from New York.But Michèle was considering going back to study, and she had been told she had some Native American blood on her father’s side – maybe if she could say how much, she figured, she would be eligible for scholarships. And so she and her husband came to be cracking up, spitting into their inidual vials. “We joked about sending them sweetener samples, to see if it still works.”In bed one night six weeks later, they pulled up the results from AncestryDNA on the laptop. They were impressed by the news about Michèle’s husband, which mostly reflected what he had always been told about his family. Then they opened Michèle’s results. “The first thing that popped up is a pie chart, and one whole half was red and said ‘Italy’.“I was dumbfounded. Like: ‘Well, that’s a huge mistake. They must have mixed mine up with someone else’s.’” She laughs, but you can hear it is hard-won. “My husband looks through it, then he says: ‘Honey, they didn’t make a mistake. This is you.’” That night, Michèle had her first ever anxiety attack.Recently DNA testing – once only accessible to doctors and detectives – has been extended to anyone curious about where they came from and willing to spend the best part of £100 to find out. Since launching in May 2012, AncestryDNA says it has tested more than 10 million people in 30 countries. 23andMe says it has more than 5 million subscribers FamilyTreeDNA claims 2 million.All of them are racing to grow their databases and their accuracy. AncestryDNA is especially visible, sponsoring the television programme Long Lost Family and running expensive adverts inviting people to discover their inner Viking (“This sword is your history”) or their innate links to the EU post-Brexit.It all sounds harmless, until you learn that as well as revealing customers’ ethnic origins, many DNA tests will also identify relatives in the companies’ databases. This “DNA-matching” can throw up previously unknown or unacknowledged brothers and sisters, cousins, uncles and aunts … or even reveal that the man you call dad is not your biological father. This is one reason that the UK’s Human Fertility and Embryology Authority is now calling on DNA testing services to warn customers about the possible emotional fallout.The kits that screen for genetic health risks can deliver equally devastating results. Yet all of these tests are typically taken in a spirit of casual curiosity. People are not prepared to have their lives rocked by what they may find out.As her results sank in, Michèle says: “I just got very quiet. All these things from my past suddenly started going through my head: questions, feelings, things that couldn’t be explained, things that my mother would get angry or defensive about if I brought them up. I started to realise: ‘I think I’ve discovered a secret.’”That night, she called her estranged mother, breaking their two-year silence. She strenuously denied any knowledge of Italian ancestry – and still Michèle thought there might have been a mistake. AncestryDNA’s database showed her as having first cousins in Syracuse, NY, where she had grown up, with an Italian surname she did not recognise.“I stood up, my laptop went to the floor, I dropped my phone and I ran to the bathroom and started vomiting.”In a series of text messages, Michèle’s mother furiously denied that her prom date was Michèle’s father, adding (Michèle says) that “it wouldn’t matter anyway”, since he had died in a motorcycle accident the previous year. “That’s how I found that out. It was very cruel.” Michèle found his obituary online, accompanied by a photo of a man with dark hair and olive skin. “It was literally the male version of me.”A subsequent paternity test of the man she had thought was her father confirmed that there was no relation. “That was devastating for both of us,” says Michèle. He had not figured in her life when she was growing up, and they had only recently reconnected. She had moved to Florida in part to be closer to him.Despite the absence of blood ties, he remains very much in Michèle’s life paradoxically, she says, the discovery made their relationship stronger. But she has severed all ties with her mother who, three years on, continues to deny the results of three DNA tests.Michèle’s story may sound dramatic, but it is not unique. Increasingly, DNA tests are bringing to light infidelities, adoptions, cover-ups and lies that have been concealed for decades.There have been cases of people learning that they were conceived from donated sperm or even that they were switched at birth, says genealogist Debbie Kennett. “There have been a lot of secrets covered up in the past, and they are starting to come out.”Last year, AncestryDNA made matches opt-in to comply with data retention legislation keeping a “can of worms” shut may have been an added bonus, Kennett suggests. The company says that while almost every customer encounters surprises on their “self-discovery journey”, these are mostly “exciting and enriching” for those with “more sensitive queries”, there is a dedicated team of experienced staff. Likewise, 23AndMe says it had specially trained customer-care representatives.“When people get these unexpected findings, they tend to distrust the science at first,” says Kennett. “But even close matches can only reveal so much in isolation. The DNA on its own doesn’t give the science – you need the contextual family information as well.”When, in June, Kathy Piercy was contacted by a woman claiming to be her first cousin, she was initially sceptical. “I thought: ‘Yeah, right – I know all my cousins.’ But there’s no doubting DNA.” She had joined AncestryDNA four months earlier to find out more about her ancestors’ journey from Ireland to New Zealand, where she lives “on a dusty road out the back of nowhere” in the rural Canterbury region. “In New Zealand and Australia, we’ve got different bits and pieces in us, so it’s more relevant. I wasn’t looking for anything in particular, because I didn’t know there was anything to find.”But Judy Poole did. Raised by adoptive parents, as an adult she forged a tenuous relationship with her biological mother, who refused to discuss her father’s identity. She had sent her sample to AncestryDNA in April hoping that it might throw up clues, but was not at all expectant. Kathy was listed as her first cousin. After some back and forth and “a bit of maths”, says Kathy, they pieced together that her father was Kathy’s uncle, who at 19 had had a fling before his marriage. He died in 2012. “Whether he knew of Judy’s existence, we will never know,” says Kathy. But she was able to put Judy in touch with his son, her half-brother – “and he was over the moon to have a big sister”, she says.Judy was taken aback by their instant connection – not to mention the physical resemblance. “I really do look like Kathy. I’ve got my father’s eyes.” She did not have an especially happy childhood, she says, so to have gained a new family has been “really special”. “If anything, you start losing relationships in later life – but I think what I really got out of spending time together was that I felt valued.” She adds: “That’s probably something that hasn’t been in my life before.”The finding has caused tension within House’s family, and some members continue to doubt it. That is the risk with DNA tests, she says: not everyone is ready to learn that what they believe to be true, is not – especially secondhand. “You don’t have to have tested yourself to discover that your father is not your father.” And as more DNA is added to the database, you could be in store for more surprises.Daily activity in an AncestryDNA community on Facebook highlights how easily they are uncovered. “Why does my sister show as a close family member or first cousin?” someone posted recently “Half sisters,” was the reply, “sorry if u didn’t know.” Another user posted about finding her father in less than 24 hours of getting her results: “I’m the happiest girl in the world right now … He didn’t even know I existed.”House says there needs to be more advice about how to approach those difficult conversations – it could even be included with the test kit. “People are being flung into these situations that are ethically extremely complicated and perhaps stressful, and they need to be able to manage it.“Anything they find out will have implications for their family. The advert that says ‘I spat in a tube and discovered I was a Viking’ does not give any sense that that is the situation you may find yourself in.”With tests that offer health screening, even surprises you have signed up for can have life-altering consequences. For example, 23andMe screens for genetic risk of diseases including Parkinson’s and late-onset Alzheimer’s, as well as whether you are a carrier for cystic fibrosis, among other conditions.Seven months later, in March this year, Altschule received an email from 23andMe, saying it had just been approved to test for three BRCA gene mutations linked to an increased hereditary risk of breast cancer. She opted in: “I believe that knowledge is power.” The results returned positive for the same BRCA 2 variant carried by her father’s cousin, who had gone on to develop cancer. The next working day she took a printout to a genetic counsellor.To get that email, she says, “is really scary and overwhelming – it’s different from a person walking you through it”. But it was also accessible. Being Ashkenazi Jewish, her risk of having such a mutation was about one in 40, which she did not know before she was diagnosed. “At first it doesn’t feel as if it’s good news, but I look at it this way: now I can take charge of my health.”She credits 23andMe’s testing with saving her life, although, she adds, it is hardly exhaustive, even for the conditions it does assess. “In reality, I probably have so many chances of developing so many things that the test doesn’t test for.” (A spokesperson for 23andMe stressed that it was not a diagnostic test, and that the many steps involved meant “the customer should be fully informed of what all the possible outcomes of the report might be, before they have even sent off their kit for testing”.)Asked if she would have agreed to be tested for a condition that she was powerless to prevent or reduce her chances of developing, Altschule isn’t sure. “If there’s nothing you can do about it, I don’t think it would be helpful.” But she seems to reconsider mid-answer. “It would definitely be hard – but if you have that information, I think any person just wants to know. But you have to be ready for the answer.”In August 2016, not three months after she had sent off her saliva sample, Michèle flew to New York to visit 80 family members she had never met. Michèle’s grandmother was delighted to meet her, her only granddaughter – and even more so to learn that she was pregnant. Her uncle took her to see her father’s grave.She remembers her four-day visit as overwhelming, exhausting and surreal. “It took me at least a couple of weeks to recover,” she says. “But they welcomed me with open arms.”Despite all that she has gained as a result – self-knowledge, a family – Michèle remains ambivalent about her “traumatic” discovery. “There have been times when I’m just kind of breaking down, and so angry and sad, that I say I wish I had never opened Pandora’s box,” she says, tearfully. Therapy, writing and, in particular, the birth of her daughter have helped her to move on.A few weeks ago, she felt able to return to AncestryDNA, for the first time in two-and-a-half years.

So now is the time for action, to listen to girls and respond, and for all organisations, government, schools and parents to work together to improve the lives of all girls and young women.”Conservative MP Maria Miller, who is chair of the Commons women and equalities committee, said: “#MeToo may have left its mark in Hollywood but for women and girls around the country their ambitions to succeed are still too often met with sexism.“It’s important more women and girls are now speaking out about how this behaviour undermines their confidence and mental health but this harmful, negative behaviour has to be stopped.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b357a08a4424b4549962feb27d2d31625f57209/0_0_4000_2646/master/4000.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b52074b29ef63d89b3a626695fcf98f7 480w","title":"brexit eu citizens special access migration advisory committee","story":"Business leaders reject need for income threshold, saying workers are needed at all levelsBusiness leaders have lined up to criticise the government’s migration advisory committee (MAC) after it proposed an “ignorant and elitist” ban on foreign workers earning less than £30,000 a year from obtaining visas to work in the UK after Brexit.Organisations representing hauliers, housebuilders and the hospitality sector were among those to sound the alarm after the committee said only “higher skilled” workers should be allowed visas, with no preferential access given to European Union citizens.Richard Burnett, the chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, which represents 7,000 hauliers, said: “We need an immigration policy across all skill levels. It is about what our businesses need. The idea that only high-skilled immigration should be allowed is both ignorant and elitist.”Brian Berry, the chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders, warned that his industry would be crippled: “It’s not at all clear that EU workers with important skills already in short supply, like bricklaying and carpentry, will not fall foul of a crude and limited definition of ‘high-skilled’ worker.”Des Gunewardena, the chairman and CEO of D\u0026ampD London, the owner of 40 upmarket restaurants, warned that businesses like his could be affected if the recommendations were taken up. “I’ve got no doubt that if movement of staff becomes difficult, we will need to scale back sharply,” he said.Its report said that the existing tier 2 skilled workers scheme, which currently applies to people outside the European Economic Area (EEA) for skilled jobs earning more than £30,000 a year, could provide a template for a future migration scheme post-Brexit as long as the cap on employing 20,700 people a year was removed.The committee made clear that ministers could develop an alternative immigration policy with the EU, which would be linked to a trade package as part of the exit negotiations. The committee added that did “not express a view on whether immigration should be part of the EU negotiations”.The CBI said it was not a roadmap for a new system for that reason, and said Britain should link an open immigration policy to the trade deals it is able to strike after Brexit.Matthew Fell, the CBI’s policy director, said: “If it is the government’s intention to implement a global system, preferential access for countries where the UK has trade deals will be essential to provide the basis for an open and controlled system that can work for the UK’s economy.”The MAC was set up to advise on the UK’s migration policy after Brexit, with a new regime expected to start when the transition period ends in 2021. It is designed to inform a white paper that has repeatedly been delayed but is due this autumn.The scale of the pushback will strengthen the hand of the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the business secretary, Greg Clark, both of whom want to soften the impact of Brexit with a less restrictive immigration policy, although they have to contend with cabinet opposition from Sajid Javid at the Home Office and wider pressure from the hard Brexit wing of the Conservative party.There was even alarm raised among some professional sectors over the MAC proposal that the UK should consider adopting a migration policy along the lines of Canada, which Manning said had “an open, welcoming approach to migration but no free movement agreement with any other country”.Alan Vallance, the chief executive of the Royal Institute of British Architects, said the recommendations “would have profound implications for architecture” because one in five architects working in the UK are already from the EU.EU citizens have, until now, been able to enter the UK freely, seeking work on arrival. Concerns about the impact of free movement is considered to be one of the central reasons why the country voted for Brexit, with the annual 100,000 target for net migration exceeded every year since it was introduced by David Cameron.Net migration to the UK in the year to the end of March 2018 was 270,000, an increase of 28,000 year on year. But net migration from the EU sank to 87,000 in the same period, the lowest level since the Brexit vote in June 2016, according to the most recent set of figures from the Office of National Statistics.Manning said the only area a visa scheme for lower-skilled workers could be required was the “possible exception” of the seasonal agricultural workers scheme. He concluded, in the foreword the MAC’s final report that there would be enough low-skilled workers in the UK because “most of the existing stock will remain and there would likely be a continued flow through family migration or the existing youth mobility scheme”.The MAC report also said EEA migration has had a small impact on wages and employment in the UK, arguing it has had “neither the large negative effects claimed by some, nor the benefits claimed by others”.A related study by Oxford Economics to inform the MAC’s analysis concluded that the average UK-based migrant from the rest of Europe contributed approximately £2,300 more to UK public finances in 201617 than the average UK adult. Each UK-born adult contributed £70 less than the average, it added.Stephen Clarke, a senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “If enacted, these proposals would effectively end low-skilled migration, while prioritising mid and high-skill migration in areas where we have labour shortages. This would represent a huge shift for low-paying sectors like food manufacturing, hotels and domestic personnel, where over one in five workers are migrants.”Labour said that it did not accept the distinction between high and low skilled put forward in the report, arguing that any future migration policy should be based on the needs of each industrial sector.Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, added: “Labour has said that our immigration policy needs to be based on our economic needs, while meeting our legal obligations and treating people fairly – which means ending the discrimination against non-EU migrants, especially from the Commonwealth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/824920850f7bf173090a2e65db121b026bb96459/0_266_4208_2526/master/4208.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d777c8cc557c12eb1b7ad4710affc94a","title":"corbyns proposals to transform labour party parked for a year","story":"Leader defeated in key votes over plans to increase the influence of the grassroots Labour’s ruling body agreed to park some of the most controversial proposals for party reform at a marathon 10-hour meeting on Tuesday, which saw Jeremy Corbyn defeated in a series of close votes.The national executive committee (NEC) set aside for a year plans for Labour councillors to be forced to defer to new “local government committees” before publishing their own manifesto, and for council leaders to be directly elected by Labour members.Nick Forbes, leader of the Labour group on the local government association, who sits on the NEC, welcomed the decision as “sensible and pragmatic”. He had warned that the plans would risk “endless infighting as groups within the party are pitted against each other”.The NEC also agreed to defer a decision about changing the role of the party’s national policy forum, instead opting to kick off a wide-ranging review of the way Labour makes policy.Another disputed proposal to more than double the size of the conference arrangements committee, which plays a crucial role in determining what is debated at the party’s annual gathering, was rejected. Just one extra seat was created.One NEC member said the meeting had generally been good-tempered, but estimated that Corbyn himself had been outvoted on more than half of the complex series of proposed rule changes.Corbyn’s political secretary, Katy Clark, has spent months carrying out a review of party democracy as the next stage in his project to transform Labour into a grassroots-led movement.As a longtime supporter of the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy lobbying group, the Labour leader advocates greater involvement by members in policymaking.But his critics fear that approach would undermine the role of Labour’s MPs and shadow ministers in developing policy, and weaken their accountability to the electorate as opposed to Labour’s membership.All the rule changes agreed by the NEC on Tuesday will be put forward to the party’s conference, which begins with a rally in Liverpool on Saturday.But a bitter battle is yet to come over how Corbyn’s successor will be chosen. Momentum, the campaign group created to back his leadership, is keen to see greater membership involvement, while the trade unions hope to regain some role in selecting which leadership candidates Labour members can choose from.A complex set of proposals and counter-proposals have been circulated in recent days. The latest iteration, tabled by party general secretary Jennie Formby at the weekend, enraged both Momentum and Labour centrists.These suggestions – and potential changes to the process for selecting and removing Labour MPs – will now be discussed at another NEC meeting on Saturday as conference gets underway, Labour sources said.This latest front in the battle for the future of Labour is sometimes pitting the trade unions against Momentum – both of which would generally be thought of as supportive of Corbyn and on the left of the party.Momentum claimed the latest plan “makes it harder for a socialist candidate to get on the ballot in the future and completely misjudges the mood of the membership”.The campaign group urged its members to lobby the NEC in advance of the meeting. It claimed hundreds of emails were sent in the half an hour before the meeting started, which it believed had helped to sway the mood towards delaying a decision, and perhaps to allow fresh proposals to be tabled.One source close to NEC said the democracy review “is going to look very thin at this rate, with many measures just either rejected out of hand or watered down by the NEC”. They added it was “especially embarrassing that local government reform has yet again been kicked into the long grass”.It is understood Momentum plans to ramp up its campaigning to persuade NEC members to back bolder reforms when the body meets again. “Everything still to play for on selections and leadership threshold,” a Momentum source said. “Seems like lots of members getting in touch did change some minds today.”The NEC also agreed proposed changes to Labour’s harassment policy, which would see independent figures involved but this falls short of the changes demanded by some campaigners, who have called for a wholly independent process.A Labour Party spokesperson said: “The Labour party is committed to continually improving our procedures for dealing with sexual harassment complaints.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/824920850f7bf173090a2e65db121b026bb96459/2022_593_2320_1393/master/2320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=120e5a2f87d551364f923f6168dc5019","title":"keir starmer clashed corbyn brexit brink of resignation customs union","story":"Shadow Brexit secretary said to have shown outrage at ‘ambush’ with customs union paper earlier this yearKeir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, was pushed to the brink of resignation early this year after Jeremy Corbyn and his allies tried to kick his customs union plan into the long grass, senior Labour sources have told the .Labour’s Brexit policy has evolved over the past 18 months through a series of painstaking negotiations between key players at the top of the party, the most fraught of which came at a stormy meeting of the “Brexit subcommittee” early this year.Corbyn’s close allies ambushed Starmer with a paper which shelved the decision on joining a customs union, a policy he had been pushing privately for weeks.Several people present at the meeting told the  the general feeling in the room was that Starmer was willing to resign rather than accept the proposals, numbered copies of which were handed out at the start of the meeting and retrieved at the end.“He looked close to telling them to shove it – and I think that did count for something,” said one MP present. “I think Jeremy was slightly surprised at how angry Keir was, and how pissed off he was.”Another witness to the confrontation said: “Jeremy started speaking, and Keir just said, enough, this was just completely outrageous. He did lose his temper. I think they were genuinely shocked at his reaction. They tried to bounce him and it completely backfired.”Starmer and his backers on the Brexit subcommittee, including Labour’s leader in the Lords, Angela Smith, and Owen Smith, who was then shadow Northern Ireland secretary, argued a customs union was the only way to safeguard manufacturing supply chains and avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.But members of Corbyn’s inner shadow cabinet, which includes Jon Trickett and Diane Abbott, were anxious about appearing to cave in to noisy backbench advocates of a customs union – such as Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie.They were also keen to ensure any stance the party ultimately took could reconcile the Brexit leavers and remainers.So they drafted their own paper, in a move that foreshadowed Theresa May’s attempt to bounce her Brexit secretary, David Davis, at Chequers, by surprising him with a handout that he, at that stage, had not seen.Within weeks Starmer’s proposal that Labour should sign up to the idea of a customs union – while insisting Britain retained the right to strike its own trade deals – was adopted. But Labour stopped short of advocating joining the single market.A Labour source insisted the paper had concerned only the party’s communications strategy. The source added that Starmer’s team had subsequently worked closely with Corbyn’s office.A source close to Starmer admitted that the meeting had been robust but insisted that he had not been close to resignation.But the face-off between the politicians underlines the tension that has hampered Labour’s progress through the political minefield of Brexit.Details of the clash emerged as the party confronts another critical moment in the evolution of its Brexit policy, with hundreds of delegates at Labour’s conference in Liverpool, which starts at the weekend, planning to force the issue of a second referendum.Labour strategists are sceptical about the idea of a new EU referendum, fearing it would risk alienating leave voters and could play into Theresa May’s hands, by giving hardline Tory rebels a reason not to vote down her deal.“The only way that her deal is going to get voted down, is if some of the European Research Group vote against it – and they’re not voting against it if they believe one of the options then is a second referendum. The surefire way to get the ERG to vote with the government is to talk about a second referendum,” said a senior Labour figure.Meanwhile, the People’s Vote campaign has published a “roadmap” to a referendum, produced by a panel including Conservative MP Dominic Grieve and Labour’s Chris Leslie.It suggests the UK could unilaterally revoke the article 50 letter sent by Theresa May last year to kick off the Brexit process and that MPs could seek to amend the parliamentary motion approving the government’s Brexit deal, to insist on a referendum.“MPs could amend the motion put forward by the government ifwhen it presents its deal to parliament. The vote on this motion is expected to take place shortly after agreement has been reached with the EU. An amendment from the opposition, Conservative backbenchers or cross-party (if allowed by the Speaker) could require that the deal be subject to a ’people’s vote’,” the analysis claims.• A special report on Labour’s Brexit policy will be published on Wednesday morning"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec20bd07e6f04954bef0c5fc518423f73931b805/0_214_4470_2683/master/4470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef9be824bd74dba83a1f2355cc177090","title":"michel barnier rebuffs uk calls for flexibility on irish border","story":"Chief negotiator says EU ready to improve proposal, but will not accept British ideas for compromise Michel Barnier has rebuffed British calls for the European Union to change its stance on the contested issue of the Irish border, and said a “moment of truth” was fast approaching on a Brexit deal.The EU’s chief negotiator said the bloc was ready “to improve” its proposal on avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, but stopped short of accepting British ideas for compromise, after the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, called on the EU to show flexibility.“The European Council in October will be the moment of truth, it is the moment when we shall see if we have an agreement,” Barnier said.The Irish border has emerged as the biggest stumbling block to the Brexit deal that Theresa May hopes to strike with the EU this autumn. While the EU and UK have agreed there should be no hard border to prevent any return to violence, they are deadlocked over how to manage what will become a 310-mile frontier between the UK and EU.Both sides have proposed fallback plans, known as backstops, that would kick into place if trade talks fail to settle the question. The EU’s involves Northern Ireland following EU law on customs and goods, a plan May has said no British prime minister could ever accept.Barnier said the EU was working to improve its proposal, adding that the problem had been caused by “the UK’s decision to leave the EU, its single market and the customs union”. Seeking to counter British criticism that the EU plan eroded UK sovereignty, he said: “What we talking about here is not a land border, not a sea border, it is a set of technical checks and controls. We respect the territorial integrity of the UK and we respect the conditional order of the UK.”Barnier was speaking after a 90-minute meeting with the EU’s 27 European affairs ministers at a summit in Brussels. Many countries intervened in the debate to stress the importance of reaching a deal and its timing.Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, got a full update from Barnier on the backstop developments and later described his meeting as “excellent”. The Irish cabinet had earlier agreed to hire 451 new staff for border duties out of a total of 1,077 needed for ports and airports.Ireland is among several EU countries concerned that having an emergency summit in November will take the pressure off the British in the coming weeks.May will appeal to EU leaders at a summit in Salzburg to soften their stance over UK access to the single market and customs union. She is expected to tell them on Wednesday night that Brussels needs to shift. A senior No 10 official said: “To come to a successful conclusion, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to do the same.”Downing Street believes that the UK has developed its negotiating position to reach the Chequers plan and it is now time for other EU countries to show some flexibility in order to finally strike a deal. The prime minister will argue that with “goodwill and determination” the UK and the EU could avoid a “disorderly” Brexit that would be damaging for both sides and instead strike a deal that benefited both.“Neither side can demand the ‘unacceptable’ of the other, such as an external customs border between different parts of the United Kingdom. No other country would accept it if they were in the same situation,” she will say.May will tell her fellow leaders that the EU’s current proposal does not respect the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK as it effectively suggests a customs border down the Irish sea with its backstop plan.She is expected to deny suggestions by EU officials that the UK is attempting to cherry-pick by seeking the rights of membership without the obligations.“That is not what we are doing,” she will say. “What we are proposing is a fair arrangement that will work for the EU’s economy as well as the UK’s, without undermining the single market.”No 10 has been cautiously optimistic in recent days that the UK can expect a softening of tone at the Salzburg summit from some EU leaders who are keen to nail down a Brexit deal this autumn.It remains to be seen whether that translates into a shift in negotiating position from Brussels, where officials have been more sceptical. The EU27 will wait to discuss next steps, including whether to relax Barnier’s negotiating mandate, until May has left the room.Meanwhile, Brussels is preparing to step up its legal action against the UK in a case of alleged customs fraud. The European commission has accused HM Revenue and Customs of negligence in controls that enabled Chinese fraudsters to evade duties, causing a €2.7bn (£2.4bn) loss to the EU budget.The commission will announce the next step in the process on Wednesday, the final stage before it can take the government to the European court of justice.Brussels launched the action in March, and British officials see the timing of the latest move – on the eve of the Salzburg summit – as provocative. “I can only speculate on the reasons, but it seems pretty obvious what is going on,” a No 10 insider said.A government spokesman said: “The UK does not accept liability for the alleged losses or recognise the estimate of alleged duty evaded. We take customs fraud very seriously and we continue to evolve our response as new threats emerge.”The alleged fraud has raised tensions between the EU and UK, contributing to mistrust about British officials’ ability to collect duties on behalf of the bloc, as proposed by the government in its unprecedented customs partnership."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9865b4640914d60b8bc779641f896366f632b333/0_23_3390_2035/master/3390.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=487cf0eba4b6d85427d37509e9796807","title":"what does your regional accent mean to you","story":"We would like to hear your thoughts and experiences for an upcoming article discussing the themeAccents can shape our identity.

This can be applied for over a period stretching to 202829, intended to help long-term construction decisions.Downing Street said May would be the first prime minister to address the summit of the NHF, which represents housing associations. In extracts of the speech released in advance, May will say she had been told the sector needed “the stability provided by long-term funding deals.“Doing so will give you the stability you need to get tens of thousands of affordable and social homes built where they are needed most, and make it easier for you to leverage the private finance you need to build many more.”In return, May will say, housing associations should use their expertise, local connections and long-term planning “to achieve things neither private developers nor local authorities are capable of doing.“Rather than simply acquiring a proportion of the properties commercial developers build, I want to see housing associations taking on and leading major developments themselves.”Last year the government announced a total of £9.1bn in public funding for council and housing association homes.Housing associations have been told the £2bn is entirely new money, and are understood to be pleased at the longer-term allocation of the money, saying it will make construction planning more feasible.May has repeatedly tried to address the affordability and supply crisis in housing, which has seen home ownership become an increasingly unrealistic prospect for many younger people.May’s speech acknowledges the new reality by praising social housing, not something done often by Conservative leaders of the recent past.“For many people, a certain stigma still clings to social housing. Some residents feel marginalised and overlooked, and are ashamed to share the fact that their home belongs to a housing association or local authority,” she was to say.“And on the outside, many people in society – including too many politicians – continue to look down on social housing and, by extension, the people who call it their home.”She is also expected to add: “We should never see social housing as something that need simply be ‘good enough’, nor think that the people who live in it should be grateful for their safety net and expect no better.”May said she wanted to see “social housing that is so good people are proud to call it their home,” adding: “Our friends and neighbours who live in social housing are not second-rate citizens.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sorry netflix we dont need another freak show","story":" Afflicted has enraged its participants, but it wouldn’t be the first TV show to use people with disabilities as entertainment fodderAn open letter to Netflix was published on Tuesday criticising its recent docu-series, Afflicted, which chronicles the lives of seven people with chronic illnesses. The letter highlighted what it called the show’s “stigmatising portrayal of disability” and was signed by a Nobel laureate as well as film-makers, writers and activists including Monica Lewinsky and Lena Dunham.Billed as portraying “baffling symptoms and controversial diagnoses”, the show follows patients as they search for treatments and some relief. But it was alleged in an article in the LA Times that producers used “unethical practices”, editing footage to suggest participants’ medical conditions were psychosomatic disorders, using few expert doctors and focusing on sceptical medics who cast doubt on whether the iniduals were ill at all (that science doesn’t understand many health conditions doesn’t make their symptoms less real).The article points out that Dan Partland, the executive producer of the series, said the aim “was to give the world a compassionate window into the difficulties of patients and families struggling with elusive and misunderstood illnesses”. Yet the participants themselves are at the forefront of the criticism. Last month, several of those included in the series wrote a joint post on Medium titled The Truth Behind Netflix’s Afflicted. Participants in the show have been harassed online and have written that they have even been physically threatened or received death threats.These are people who trusted the programme-makers to help spread understanding of their conditions to the public, and say they were rewarded by having their lives mocked to peddle prejudice. As Jill Maxi Edelstein, who has multiple chemical sensitivity, wrote in her essay criticising the show: “I trusted you with my heart and my story, and now you are using it against me and my people.”But this isn’t simply about hurt feelings. As the letter says, Netflix reaches 300 million viewers worldwide and its programmes have the power to “reinforce barriers to appropriate medical care or disability benefits, dampen the support of vital research, and add to the stigma and social isolation of an already profoundly marginalised group of people”. There is a long history of disability being used as entertainment, from TV following rare medical conditions to dwarf wrestling – modern-day Victorian freak shows.When groups are stereotyped on TV, it does not just reflect the prejudices of the time but can be key in perpetuating them. Distorted depictions can be particularly damaging for people with chronic illnesses – who are typically disbelieved and told: “‘It’s all in your head,” but this goes for many minorities whose lives are used as entertainment fodder for the majority. The residents on Benefits Street, the Channel 4 documentary centred on a deprived Birmingham community, became synonymous with the “scrounger” rhetoric in the early years of cuts to the welfare budget. White Dee, one of the central figures in the show, later said the way she and her neighbours were portrayed “ripped us apart”, although a senior Channel 4 executive insisted that it was important to tell the stories of “distressed parts of our society”.Shows that purport to do good can fall into this trap. My Week As a Muslim, in which a white woman went “undercover” to understand Islamophobia, was criticised for using “brown-face” and centring the story on white people. If you want to understand racism, perhaps just listen to its victims.Controversy sells and programme-makers can create hate figures or a “freak” for added revenue. This gets more worrying in the age of social media. When television comes with hashtags, producers may whip up a crowd and then let them loose on their target.Ultimately, it is not simply bad publicity caused by an open letter that is going to talk companies such as Netflix into being responsible – it is viewers who can send the loudest message by switching off. Besides, who wants to watch ill people’s lives being exploited?“The spirit of much of what has been the #MeToo movement is to ide men and women,” Sean Penn opined this week. It is funny to say it is women speaking out about assault that is isive for the sexes rather than, say, the fact that men keep assaulting. As McDonald’s staff in the US launch an unprecedented strike against sexual harassment, there’s a sense that women are fighting back – and a contingent of men are feeling their dominance is threatened by the whole thing.The alleged victim of Trump’s nominee for the US supreme court – nominated by a pussy grabber, no less – has dared to speak up. Brett Kavanaugh has denied the allegation. “If somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man certainly should be worried. We can all be accused of something,” responded a lawyer close to the White House.The question, of course, is whether these men “should be worried” because they’ve done nothing wrong – or they have and are disturbed that they may no longer be able to get away with it. As Penn went on, #MeToo is just “too black and white”. Assault is such a grey area, isn’t it? It’s the flipside to the idea that consent is too complex for men to understand – as if you may accidentally rape a woman as you try to ask her out. (Neither sex comes out of this well.)Consent, apparently, is simultaneously too complicated and too simplistic. Women – hysterical, isive, or vindictive – will throw accusations around and men can’t even flirt without a feminist trying to destroy them. Whether it’s at a McDonald’s or the supreme court bench, time is increasingly up on lazy, misogynistic excuses. If women speaking out is so unpalatable to men such as Trump, I’d suggest they’re doing something right.“What brings you here after all this time?,” asks a now grownup Jane in the new trailer for Mary Poppins Returns. A film industry running out of ideas and a profit-driven market! Perhaps I’m in a millennial crisis, but what’s Poppins without Julie Andrews or little Michael’s knobbly knees? That Dick Van Dyke has reprised his elderly banker role but is now nearly as old as the character he played first time round is like a dystopian microcosm of the remake age: we’re doomed to watch our youths be rehashed poorly – and the only reward is more grey hairs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b76db79fa31db70383a057f1f1ab2be3b301a9b/125_134_3056_1834/master/3056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af9522584b6df92fd39b6a81eb8a7a9a","title":"anthony joshua timekeeping sparring alexander povetkin","story":"• Joshua says he is in great shape for Alexander Povetkin• ‘It’s about preserving you body,’ adds heavyweight championAnthony Joshua expects to be in the best shape of his career against Alexander Povetkin on Saturday after ditching his alarm clock in favour of long lie-ins. The WBA, IBF and WBO champion has also scrapped his early-morning runs and introduced specific eye exercises into his training regime after sports scientists found he could do more to improve his recovery and performance.“We have looked at stuff like sleeping, the amount of time I spend on my phone, my eyes – your eyes have muscles so you have to work your eye sockets – and recovering between sessions,” Joshua said. “You know Cristiano Ronaldo is 33 but has the body of a 21-year-old? It’s about preserving your body. I could go in there and knock out Povetkin in a round or two but then there is the eight weeks of intense sparring, doing 200 rounds, you have to protect your body.“You can kind of predict if I tell you seven days out of 10 I’m feeling rough, by the eighth day you’re going to know to ease it off before you crash.”Joshua has learned from other modern greats that the old ways were not necessary best. “Boxing is old school,” he said. “But when I watched a Manny Pacquiao documentary he does the same thing. Floyd Mayweather also trains when he is ready, same with Vasyl Lomachenko.“I saw 10.34am on a clock when he was waking up and I was like: ‘What?’ I’m here getting up at the crack of dawn?’”Joshua, who now wakes up naturally at 8am, added: “I tried it and feel much better. It looks lazy but you’re still getting the same amount of work done and in a better way.”Joshua, who is 29 next month, insists he is ready for Povetkin after the hardest sparring of his career. “It has been tough, I am not going to lie. My body is in pain. I’ve done 15 rounds, 13 rounds, 12 rounds, back to back but one thing I do know is I have got a deep well, a lot of fire.“I have got enough heart to slug it out with Povetkin, same with Wladimir Klitschko. Even though some people may be more skilled, have longer arms or be taller, sometimes it is about what is in your heart. And I know I have got that for sure.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ff7b06ee04286ed8652e07e8ad6ced71e303e8f/198_252_2819_1692/master/2819.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e086881ad08ef2951b6e6c125dde0089","title":"surreys rory burns maintains push for england spot with runs at somerset","story":"• Day one: Surrey 368-4 v Somerset• Surrey’s top four all pass 50 on a tough day for bowlersThis will not be such a stressful match for the pitch liaison officer. Two weeks ago in Somerset’s match against Lancashire 22 wickets fell on the first day against Surrey there were four. Phil Whitticase can sleep easily unless he concludes this surface is too flat for the good of the game – an unlikely outcome since liaison officers rarely reach that conclusion even though this proposition is sometimes well worth\u0026nbspconsidering.This is likely to be a stress-free match for both sets of players as well. Surrey have already secured the championship pennant while Somerset would like to guarantee themselves another second place. A couple of weeks ago this was destined to be a tense championship decider but Surrey sprinted home as Somerset faltered. There is no doubt who are the best side in the summer of 2018.Do not expect a surface like this in Galle when England play their next Test in November. The pitch in Sri Lanka will have much more in common with the one on which the wickets tumbled a fortnight ago at Taunton but do anticipate some of the combatants here to be in there in six weeks.In all probability Surrey’s captain, Rory Burns, will be opening the batting. He shared a 147-run partnership with one of his likely predecessors, Mark Stoneman, who made 85 before he was dismissed by the Overton brothers – Jamie bowled it, Craig caught it in the gully. Burns hit a solid 78 taking his tally for the season to 1,319 the next highest run scorer in the first ision is James Vince with 896.Watch Burns for 10 minutes and he does not look a Test cricketer – he is the antithesis of Vince, a businesslike batsman rather than a beautiful one. Before the ball is released there is an odd twitch of the shoulders and an airy wave of the bat but once the ball is propelled he is in an orthodox position and from there he waits for his chance to clip the ball calmly away. Note his volume of runs, a much better barometer of a player than the odd silky cover drive. He deserves his chance.All the other Surrey batsmen bedded in on this enticing surface and it was odd no one reached three figures in their total of 368 for four. Most, with the obvious exception of Dean Elgar, will merit consideration when the England selectors gather to pick their Test squad for Sri Lanka, though this little audition would have been more meaningful if this had been one of Taunton’s “Ciderabad” pitches. Stoneman’s chance may have come and gone but Jason Roy could come into contention before long.Here Roy batted at three in his first red-ball outing of the summer and on this surface he naturally looked every inch a Test player – unlike Burns. By his standards he was watchful at the start but soon there were effortless drives to the boundary plus two nonchalant flicks over the rope off Jack Leach. It all looked so simple for Roy whereupon he was lbw to Jamie Overton from the last ball of the afternoon session.Ollie Pope, a more serious contender for the tour party, was less fluent though still capable of some exquisite straight drives before he flicked to square leg off Josh Davey on 44. However, Pope has survived a remarkable season, in which he has become a Test player, rather better than Dom Bess, who was not in Somerset’s XI. In a bewildering summer for him those two Tests against Pakistan must seem like a distant dream.Somerset have their tour hopefuls as well. The most obvious is Jack Leach, who bowled 19 wicketless overs. His figures look very ordinary but he did not bowl too badly. Jamie Overton, who has an outside chance of a wildcard call-up, was the most threatening of the bowlers thanks to his extra pace on a day when there was barely a millimetre of deviation for any of the bowlers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f7ef672694184dae453cc702e87770f1faae59f/0_90_2381_1429/master/2381.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59f8bcf6692d15de823dd7081631a7a4","title":"tommy fleetwood ryder cup 2018 golf interview","story":"Three years ago the Southport golfer had the yips so badly he feared for his future in the game, but now he is a household nameNext Friday, 28 September, will forever hold a place in Tommy Fleetwood’s heart. It is hardly being dismissive of the golfer’s idyllic family backdrop to suggest that in 2018 the date will carry extra resonance. “It will be a very special day,” Fleetwood explains. “I’ll stand on the tee and it’s my son’s first birthday as I play in my first Ryder Cup. As a Friday goes, that one will take some beating. The funny thing is Frankie won’t have a clue, he isn’t bothered one little bit.”Daddy is prepared for a wave of emotion. And no wonder Fleetwood’s Ryder Cup debut is just the latest high point in a career he has retrieved from the depths of despair. “I’ll quite happily go with the flow,” the world No 12 adds. “I have spoken about it to people I work with it is important to me to take the moment in and realise where you are, what an amazing achievement it is to get there. You owe that to yourself, to enjoy that moment on the first tee. It’s a moment everybody wants in their life. As nervous as people say you are – and don’t get me wrong, I’ll be really, really nervous – you owe it to yourself to embrace it because that’s what you have wanted for such a long time.”No assessment of Fleetwood’s rise at vertiginous pace, to the point where he is perfectly at home with the world’s best players, is complete without a nod towards earlier professional trauma. A second round of 76 at the 2015 Open sent the Southport man into a 12-month tailspin, during which there were times when he was scared to hit the ball – the yips. Fleetwood, earlier a prodigy, was 188th in the world and “demoralised”.By June this year he was producing a stunning 63 to come within touching distance of US Open glory. On Thursday he will tee off alongside Tiger Woods in the $10m conclusion to the PGA Tour’s season. The most endearing thing about Fleetwood’s rehabilitation is the discovery of not a single person within the game’s upper echelons who begrudge him it.“Struggling has done a couple of things for me,” Fleetwood says. “It is an experience to have and it makes you appreciate the good stuff. Sometimes now I get frustrated, I have been frustrated recently at putting one poor round in and not finishing an event off, but it is important when those feelings come to snap out of it and realise how well you are doing, how tough the game is. My experiences are a help.“I was a shot away from winning a major this year and had a chance in the Open that didn’t pan out over the last 15 holes. The important thing is you keep improving but remember where you were a couple of years ago.“I have always been a very patient person, I am a perfectionist but have a high level of patience and think that’s one of the things when I started my comeback that really helped … I wasn’t rushing anything as long as I knew I was on the right track.“The other thing about having that yip off the tee is that when I have played in majors, even the 63 in the US Open when I knew something was on, I have a freedom in myself. No last three holes in pursuit of a historic round in a US Open are as worrying as not being able to keep it on the golf course, to not knowing where it is going. I can always take a moment when things are going well, when pressure might build, to think: ‘You’ve had a lot worse than this.’”There is no current need for dark thoughts. Fleetwood and Woods is the marquee pairing for round one of this week’s Tour Championship at East Lake as just 30 qualified competitors joust for huge sums. Woods, the 14-times major winner, has stated his admiration for Fleetwood, whom he partnered for the first time at this year’s Masters. Far from being intimidated, the Briton comfortably made the Augusta cut.“We were drawn together again at the Northern Trust – it was the same three-ball actually – and I played really well there,” Fleetwood says. “I was happy about that one because I’d been asked who my favourite person to play with. I said Tiger. Whoever asked me was like: ‘Really?’Generally people might think: ‘This is Tiger Woods’ or the crowd might put you off. I said it after the Masters, I really enjoyed it and I wanted to do it again.“You’ve got to say playing this week is a really, really good achievement. As much as I’ll be trying to win, I’ll have ticked off a goal. Hopefully I’ll play with a bit of freedom looking towards the Ryder Cup.”Discussion between the pair presumably will revert towards next weekend and Le Golf National. Woods’s own renaissance means he will form part of the USA team as they seek to retain the trophy won two years ago at Hazeltine.Fleetwood will face an American team for the first time since he was an 18-year-old in 2009, Rickie Fowler then among the home contingent who dished out a heavy beating to Great Britain and Ireland in the Walker Cup at Merion.“You don’t know when you are going to see those guys again but you are going to see some of them,” Fleetwood says. “It has taken me a while but that was a big motivational thing for me. They were definitely better than us at so many things, plus it was in America. But I’m glad it was because a lot of the time when we played at home the odds were stacked in our favour with the type of golf played. If you win that, maybe it’s not quite the same as getting beaten and using it as fuel.”It is little wonder, then, that Fleetwood will take stock on Friday week. His first, vivid Ryder Cup memories are from 1997, when Seve Ballesteros’s side won by a point at Valderrama. “I have obviously watched them all since, you just get a passion for it,” he says.Fleetwood has earned the right to nurse the dream. His story remains an inspiration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed6f49a53e15aaaa27628d1652522becb3a55007/200_482_4157_2495/master/4157.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d83590cc8a01773fb5576327d0273f7c","title":"england pro contracts change womens rugby union for ever","story":"There is nothing new about professionalism in women’s rugby. Since the Netherlands became the first country to award contracts to their women’s sevens players in 2011, the rest of the women’s rugby world has been playing catch-up – off the pitch at least – in the game’s rapid acceleration towards the pro ranks.Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa, Canada, the US, Russia and Spain quickly followed the Dutch lead and England eventually offered full-time contracts in 2014.So to the casual observer of Monday’s announcement that England are to offer full-time permanent deals to the nation’s top 15s players, perhaps it felt like old news. But that would be to underestimate a groundbreaking decision that is set to change the women’s game for ever. For while there is indeed nothing new about professionalism within women’s rugby, a full-time sevens game is a vastly different beast from a pro 15s game.Primarily this is because sevens funding does not just trickle down from a country’s own national union. Income for top sevens players, who are competing on the World Series and at the Olympics, is usually a mix and match affair with investment also flowing from the many other bodies which offer investment for Olympic sports. In Canada, for example, a significant chunk of its women’s programme is funded by Own the Podium, a not-for-profit organisation which funds an array of Olympic sports.While that funding is hardly excessive, it has meant the shift from amateur to professional in women’s sevens has been relatively pain-free thanks to a stable funding base, while at the same time allowing less-established rugby nations like Spain, Canada, Russia and – for a short period – the Netherlands, to keep up and thrive.The same will not be true in a professional women’s 15s world where primary sources of funding will remain union-driven. England’s deals will include a flat player contract fee plus match fees, on top of which leading players will be free to secure their own sponsorship and commercial deals.They will become the first permanent full-time Test team, having had contracts trialled for a year in the lead up to the 2017 World Cup, and will have rival nations like France and New Zealand, who currently offer part-time deals to top 15s players, watching on with envy.It was interesting if not naive to see players from other nations herald England’s decision and raise demands for their own unions to follow suit and create a “level playing field”. The stark truth is that there will be no level playing field and, just like the men’s game, the countries offering the most financial clout to their teams will streak ahead.But it will not all be about cash – it will also be about will. Countries like Ireland, Australia and Wales have yet to show significant willing when it comes to matching their potential with the funding that would help to realise it. Countries with less cash, like 2017 World Cup semi-finalists USA and former Six Nations competitors Spain, will find themselves expected to compete with full-time players and falling behind.It would be tempting to draw parallels with where the men’s game was when it turned professional in the 1990s but this time players are contracted to their union, a decision which will bring its own challenges while offering stability.As with all great steps forward in sport, England’s decision has in part been driven by pressure and by lessons learned in failure. The Rugby Football Union faced a PR storm at last year’s World Cup following the news that the players who had taken them all the way to the final would be out of contract and therefore out of a job just hours after the final whistle.The RFU’s announcement on Monday was a vindication of sorts for those, including leading English players, who hammered the union for their poor handling and short-termism.While it is understandable that the RFU’s decision has been reported in some quarters as a U-turn, the truth is it is so much more than that: women’s 15s is going pro and the game is set to change for ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bae27890db89caa4ec4fdc452c0a63d91e6187ed/994_489_1213_727/master/1213.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54265bbbd683503cad3758c079cd2be9","title":"joe penhall on stephen jeffreys playwright","story":"The work of his friend and fellow playwright, says Penhall, was warm, incisive, unassuming but clever – just like the man‘You’re not going to like me …” Thus began The Libertine, the most famous play by Stephen Jeffreys, a friend and a great influence on my playwriting who has died after a long illness. I remember him finishing the play and reading me the first paragraph. He used to giggle at his own good lines – as all playwrights should. And of course we all liked him. He helped rear a generation of Royal Court writers as the theatre’s literary associate, yet, as a playwright, was surprisingly underrated. An entire generation of dramatists was bonded to him, a symbol of selflessness in a sometimes narcissistic profession.And what a generation. He mentored Sarah Kane whose Blasted had its first champion in Stephen. Jez Butterworth’s first play Mojo was produced on his watch I remember him raving to me about it and urging me to take note. Martin McDonagh’s Beauty Queen of Leenane emerged under Stephen’s watchful eye – the play’s ruthless symmetry, black wit and machine-tooled brilliance delighted him. He was a friend and mentor to Roy Williams, Jonathan Harvey, Rebecca Pritchard and Michael Wynne and, I dare say, every other playwright who passed through the doors of the Royal Court in the 90s and noughties. His lectures on structure were famous. (He’d rifle through a box of matches, fiddle with the match at length, only lighting it at the very end … to teach us about suspense and the pay off.) He soothed you through failure, cheered you on in success. When he was impressed, you knew you’d got it right.When I was about 23, living above a pizza bar, earning chicken feed as a pizza delivery guy and occasionally being held up at knifepoint, I wondered if I could write my way out of trouble. Stephen’s A Going Concern about a small family business was one of the plays that showed me the way. He midwifed my play Pale Horse, ripping the first draft from my hands and racing over to Stephen Daldry with it, announcing the next day that it was going on with Ray Winstone starring. (My next play was rejected. Stephen: “But where’s the ride, Joe? When I read your plays I’m in it for the ride, man!” I took him so seriously that it took me a year to forgive him.)Like Pinter, he was interested in men in families like Mamet, he was interested in work. But he was great friends with April De Angelis and Caryl Churchill and no fan of the era’s rampant “laddish” culture.He wrote poetically and memorably about a group of aspirational young couples in a grotty shared house in Earl’s Court (Valued Friends), a devout, black blues singer in the Mississippi Delta (I Just Stopped By to See the Man) and the libertine’s libertine, the Earl of Rochester. All his plays were good. I only wish there had been more. They were simple but sophisticated warm but incisive unassuming but clever – never showy or attention-seeking – just like the man. He knew that great writing could never be subjugated to gimmickry.I recently visited him in hospital with fellow acolyte Simon Stephens. We did our best to entertain him with a steady stream of quips and boasts while he did his best to reply from the foggy depths of his treatment. He smiled gently and it was hard to make out what he was saying. As a writer it was never hard – he had a directness like a good handshake. He did indeed value his friends and we valued him. A tearful day for playwrights."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6157e57853c0e2671b502425e4af04ba39beecde/0_5_6570_3942/master/6570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f22ca853e6a283a4d77736442871a3a1","title":"steel review sharp witted political drama from chris bush","story":"Crucible, SheffieldBush tackles sexism and racial prejudice in a cross-generational commentary on contemporary politicsIn Chris Bush’s new play, steel is a multi-faceted metaphor. It’s resolve. It’s the unbending tenacity needed to break into a world designed to exclude you. And it’s Sheffield, the never-named but ever-present backdrop to her sharp-witted political drama. In 1988, a young woman of colour fights to get elected to the local council. In 2018, her present-day counterpart is the ambitious candidate parachuted in from London for the metro mayor contest – or, at least, so her Yorkshire-born-and-bred antagonists believe.Amid the plastic chairs and scuffed wooden fittings of Madeleine Girling’s beautifully observed set, both time frames stage a meeting of new blood and old guard. In the 80s, steelworks engineer and union rep Josie is taken under the wing of old hand Dai in the present, Vanessa forms an uneasy working partnership with her election officer Ian, a proud local and old-fashioned Labour man. Alongside sexism and racial prejudice, the two women confront generational differences and, in Vanessa’s case, the north-south ide. “You don’t fit here,” says Ian, meaning Sheffield – though he might as well be talking about the male-dominated world of politics.Snapping between roles, Rebecca Scroggs and Nigel Betts perform in both eras, their consistent presence stressing how little has changed in 30 years. The young black woman is still having to appease the older white man. The self-styled “good guys” still have an ugly streak of misogyny. In both of her roles, Scroggs captures the tension between speaking one’s mind and holding one’s tongue, while Betts tacks between condescending benevolence and wounded pride.At times, the play verges on editorialising, but the arguments that dart across the stage always feel deeply rooted in the beliefs of the characters. And they are debates that we still need to be having. As Vanessa and Josie know, representation matters. In Vanessa’s words, “if you represent you can inspire”. For all the petty disagreement and lost faith that characterises contemporary politics, Steel makes it rousingly clear why some battles remain worth fighting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9acb76ab99524edd5e56a3696c4ff9596f837e1f/112_434_4796_2878/master/4796.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3673ff27cd30afd3f9c3dad4886675d2","title":"iphone xs max review roundup iphone xr","story":"Early consensus from tech press is these are best iPhones to date. But is it worth holding on for the cheaper iPhone XR?The first wave of verdicts from select reviewers given early access to Apple’s latest iPhone XS and XS Max are live.Gone are the traditional iPhones of yesteryear, with three devices launched all with a design in line with last year’s iPhone X. The iPhone XS is a direct replacement for the 2017 iPhone X, complete with a 5.8in screen costing £999. The iPhone XS Max is a larger, more expensive phone costing £1,099 and with a 6.5in screen, the largest on an iPhone.The iPhone XR is a slightly cheaper phone costing £749 with a 6.1in screen, but it won’t be released until October., not given early access to the new phones, will review them when they arrive in the post with normal punters’ pre-orders. But for now, this is what a privileged few thought of the to most expensive iPhones for 2018.It’s a pretty and premium design befitting of a phone which starts at £999, but also one which strikes me as being still worryingly susceptible to damage. The glass back is slippery when not covered in a case, though it doesn’t seem to collect as many fingerprints as the iPhone X, and it’s fairly heavy despite being thin. It also looks and feels expensive, which is just as well, because it is.But it is the camera improvements that are worth buying:The XS series is a significant improvement on the X – colour is richer and more evenly dispersed (this is thanks to the Quad-LED True Tone flash), with brights and neons really popping, and texture is captured in higher quality. These are best evidenced in portraits of people: skin and hair is closer to life than the photos taken in previous models.The better sensor and the new image processor on the A12 Bionic chip combine to enable what Apple calls “Smart HDR.” In practice, that means my photos look better in low light and extreme contrast situations, making for better pictures whether shot on a night-time street, in a dark bar or in bright sunlight.Bright lights in my living room show more detail now, and don’t turn into blown-up bright spots like they used to. I see more detail around windows and street lights. I’m also finding less blur and noise in most shots. Sometimes, it almost seems like too much light. The colour and brightness of some shots is surprising. I’m much happier with my photos now.FaceID on the XS is ever so slightly faster than the X — just an extra beat quicker. It’s noticeable side by side, but it’s not so much faster that you won’t find yourself pointedly staring at the phone to unlock it from time to time. iOS 12 lets you add a “secondary appearance,” which allows you to set up a second person if you want, which is nice.Other than the minor speed increase and secondary appearance support, FaceID is still FaceID: it doesn’t work in landscape or upside down or anything like that. If you wear glasses like me, you’ll still have to enter your passcode every morning when you wake up because you’re holding the phone too close to your face for it to work. And sunglasses that block IR light will still prevent it from working — Apple says it’s working with sunglass makers to ship new kinds of sunglasses that support FaceID. (Only Apple can get another entirely different industry to adapt to its phone, instead of the other way around.)The XS is basically a new model with some improvements. Most of those improvements, though, are kind of hard to notice.Take the screen, for example. It’s still a brilliant, colourful and sharp OLED display that supports next-gen HDR 4K video. It’s one of the best screens on the market, up there with the display on the Samsung Galaxy Note 9. But some of the improvements, like its increased dynamic range, can only be spotted when viewing photos. And even then, I don’t think most folks will notice. This isn’t bad it just means the screen is still really good and we’re getting to a point where it’s hard to distinguish upgrades.Aside from one of the phones having a giant display, the iPhone XS and the larger iPhone XS Max don’t feel much different from last year’s iPhone X. This year’s phones don’t spark strong feelings – except maybe chagrin that they cost so much.It’s impressive incrementalism: There’s a noticeably faster chip, and a camera that captures a greater level of detail that you can actually see. Apple has nudged innovation in smartphones forward again, even if some of the results (like new apps that will use the new tech) have yet to be experienced.With subtle but strong improvements over last year’s X, (subtle, that’s what the S stands for, right?) the XS and XS Max are fabulous phones. But we’ve hit a point where every smartphone is great — it comes down to what you want and what you want to spend.Don’t blame me, blame Apple … and keep your wallet closed. See you in a month with the XR review.Stern also noted that you’ll probably need a case if you do buy one of these £1,000+ phones:Both the XS and XS Max have what Apple says is “the most durable glass in the world.” That said, my XS Max review unit cracked after a minor fall onto wood. All these glass slabs still need protection.The iPhone XS Max design is deceptive. Pick it up, and the rounded sides of the handset make it feel noticeably thick.The result is a phone that doesn’t sit as comfortably in the hand as it could, and considering the size and cost of the XS Max it’s a phone you want to be able to securely hold. This is only half the story though.We compared the iPhone XS Max to a number of phones during our in-depth review, including the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (6.4-inch screen), OnePlus 6 (6.2-inch) and Sony Xperia XZ3 (6-inch), and the iPhone felt thicker, and less planted in the hand then all of them.The funny thing is though, the iPhone XS Max is thinner than all of those phones at just 7.7mm.The reason for this is simple: tapered edges. The Samsung, Sony and OnePlus all taper their rear edges, giving the impression of a thinner device while also allowing them to sit a little better in the curvature of your hand.The iPhone XS Max has a totally flat back that’s a little more awkward to hold, and we found that a tactfully-placed pinkie finger on the underside of the phone was a must for one-handed use.There’s been a lot of discussion raging online over whether it’s too big, which I wholly disagree with.The iPhone XS Max demands two hands, and how much you enjoy this will hinge on how accustomed you are to using larger handsets. I’ve been a fan of larger phones for years, so not being able to text one-handed or having to stretch my hand up to reach and pull down the Control Centre is worth it in terms of the benefits presented by a larger screen: higher resolution, making watching TV, films and videos a better experience, and making it easier to play games, write documents and emails and edit photos.If you don’t like larger phones, the answer is simple: no one’s forcing you to buy one.So while the iPhone XS and XS Max appear to be the best smartphones Apple has made, and you won’t be disappointed if you’re an iPhone-only buyer and have already pre-ordered them, it might be worth waiting to see what the marginally cheaper iPhone XR is like before sinking £1,000 into a new iPhone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe321c88e58b1a41f0c30c92a6c410a7c5b70053/0_61_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ff9c6abb1cbc6376f5200e0712fd4d0","title":"tesla investigation elon musk tweets reports","story":"More bad news is piling up for Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of the electronic car company Tesla. Tesla is now under investigation by the US justice department over statements the company and Musk made last month.Tesla’s value has fallen by almost a third since his initial tweets, wiping nearly $18bn off the value of the company.The investigation comes on top of a civil investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and lawsuits from investors.Tesla said in a statement: “Last month, following Elon’s announcement that he was considering taking the company private, Tesla received a voluntary request for documents from the DoJ and has been cooperative in responding to it.“We have not received a subpoena, a request for testimony, or any other formal process. We respect the DoJ’s desire to get information about this and believe that the matter should be quickly resolved as they review the information they have received.”Last month Musk tweeted he was contemplating taking Tesla private and had “funding secured” for the deal. The tweet sent Tesla’s share price soaring, but the price collapsed after it emerged that funding had not been secured.Earlier this month Musk abandoned plans to take Tesla private after shareholders had persuaded him against the idea.“Although the majority of shareholders I spoke to said they would remain with Tesla if we went private, the sentiment, in a nutshell, was, ‘Please don’t do this’,” Musk wrote in the blogpost.The latests legal issues come as investors have become increasingly concerned about Musk’s behaviour. The Tesla boss is being sued by British er Vernon Unsworth after Musk falsely accused Unsworth of being a “pedo”. Unsworth helped rescue the young football players trapped in a Thai cave and had criticized Musk’s plans to send a miniature submarine to help the rescue effort.Tesla’s shares took another tumble in early September when Musk smoked marijuana on a live web show and two senior executives announced they were leaving."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40b1c4df17c6914f58e8f6716ef2d1617d7fd03c/0_217_3275_1966/master/3275.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e871a1f1968357238e7c496a1bfd28c","title":"different paths mutual respect susan and jo wokoma on sisterhood","story":"Susan’s an actor and Jo’s a nurse – the Wokoma sisters inhabit very different worlds. But that doesn’t prevent them being each other’s most avid supporter“Jo has this incredibly noble job,” says Susan Wokoma of her little sister, a nurse. “But she’ll say: ‘When we were growing up, we’d watch TV and now you’re in programmes I watch.’ That makes me feel proud of what I’ve done.”Since graduating from drama school in 2010, Susan has rarely been off our screens, notably with parts in supernatural teen drama Crazyhead and cult hit Chewing Gum. She’s also been successful on stage, making her West End debut in 2017 in James Graham’s Labour of Love. It means that although she and Jo still live close to one another in south London, where they grew up, they can sometimes go months without meeting up. “With my job, it’s really difficult,” she says. “I have to drop everything if I get a role and it can be all-consuming. But when we can, we’ll meet for a drink – it’s lovely.”As children, Susan and Jo weren’t nearly as close. Susan was the third child of four and Jo the youngest, so she got away with a lot, Susan says. “My older brother was the only boy, so he could do no wrong, whereas I consider myself the middle child.” Their mother, a cleaner who worked night shifts at MI5, dressed Susan and her elder sister identically, despite their six-year age gap. “When she started to get too old for it, I thought, ‘Cool’ – but then Jo turned up and I had to match with her. Mum dressed us like little Victorian children.”Three-and-a-half years younger, Jo looked up to Susan. “I wanted to follow her everywhere, but on the handful of times she’d take me to her friends’ houses, I’d do something to annoy her – like ask too many questions,” says Jo.“She spoke gobbledygook for a long time, and I couldn’t make out what she was saying – I found her quite sinister,” laughs Susan.For a period, their mother worked at Peckham fire station and would occasionally take the girls to work with her. One of Susan’s favourite memories, she recalls, is of the firefighters letting them play with the hoses, and drenching each other with water.At school, Susan was the good girl, “smart and very together”, recalls Jo, whereas Jo herself was “forever getting into trouble or getting suspended”. During their teenage years, they argued a lot – about makeup, magazines or clothes. Their paths erged even further after a teacher advised Susan to audition for the National Youth Theatre.“After that, I knew my route quite quickly, whereas Jo was quite a difficult kid and it took her a bit longer to find what she wanted to do,” says Susan.Their relationship changed in the coming years. “I’m not especially close to our older sister, so I thought: ‘Be the older sister you would want.’ I started asking Jo how she was, what was going on in her life. I wanted to be the first person she would come to if she was having trouble,” says Susan.Jo had decided to train as a nurse, but halfway through her course, she became pregnant. “I was only 20 and we all knew my dad was going to be really cross, because he wanted me to finish uni,” says Jo.Their Nigerian father worked full-time in the Home Office, as well as having a weekend security job at the Royal Festival Hall. “He had that immigrant mentality of work, work, work,” says Susan, and he wanted his children to do well.“I didn’t tell him until I was over five months pregnant,” says Jo, “and I asked Susan to come with me.”Their father died after Jo’s son was born, and it was Susan’s encouragement that drove Jo to finish her nursing degree. “He always said he wanted me to go back and finish, and I had no intention of doing it, but Susan had just finished filming The Inbetweeners 2 in Australia and she said: ‘If you complete it by the summer, you can come with me to the premiere.’ I graduated and she took me with her, which was really cool.”Now, they message via WhatsApp almost every day, even when Susan is filming, and meet up in person whenever they can. “As I’ve got older I’ve realised she’s super-quick and super-funny,” says Susan. “Actually, she’s overtaken me in some ways – she’s got all these responsibilities, while I’m floating around auditioning or trying to write stuff. I’ve got massive respect for her.”The feeling’s mutual. “Susan’s always been very real and matter-of-fact,” says Jo. “When I was younger I didn’t quite understand – I just thought she was horrible! Now I realise she’s straight with me and that’s what we all lack in our lives. A lot of people tell us what we want to hear, but Susan’s not like that. Any advice she gives is always spot-on, and always in my best interests. She’s a really special person.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f91bebf7b4013fafbabd01fbaaa20a3394aab122/0_121_1799_1079/master/1799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81cb6b8a168e6f3e64e4775c806950db","title":"chef tom oldroyd on his inspirational siblings and post polpo ventures","story":"Tom Oldroyd is one of London’s hottest chefs. We visit his Islington eatery along with his brother and sister – William and Olivia – for an overdue catch-up beer and lunchCreativity runs in the Oldroyd family. Chef Tom Oldroyd is known for his reinvention of classic European dishes, first at Polpo, where he was chef-director, and now at his own restaurant, Oldroyd, which he opened in Islington in 2015. His flair for imaginative thinking is a trait he shares with his siblings, William, a director whose 2017 debut film Lady Macbeth was Bafta-nominated, and Olivia, who manages exhibitions at the V\u0026ampA.“We’re all pretty similar, really,” says Tom, 36. “All three of us have followed our passions and we’ve been lucky enough to make them into our careers.”Their success means the pace of life is frenetic for all three, with each putting in long hours and William and Olivia often travelling for work. But the trio have remained remarkably close, making sure they carve out time to catch up with one another over a drink or a meal together.“Tom lives round the corner from me in Hackney, so when we can, we’ll pop to the local pub for a quick pint,” says William, the eldest at 38. “Olivia is in Shepherd’s Bush, so when we’re all in London at the same time, we meet for Sunday lunch at Tom’s restaurant.” Tom’s style of cooking is ideal for a big family get-together. “I love food you can pass around and make conversation about,” he says.If most siblings experience some degree of rivalry growing up, the Oldroyds insist that wasn’t the case for them. It’s not difficult to believe. They share a natural optimism, talk about one another’s achievements with obvious pride and say that, first and foremost, they’re friends. “We’re very supportive of one another, and we get on really well,” says Olivia, 35.With two years separating each sibling from the next, there were inevitable squabbles during their childhood, but they were always a tight-knit unit. They grew up in Guildford, in a house opposite their primary school, where their mother was a teacher. Tom called her “Mrs Mummy”. Credit for their lack of competitiveness goes to their parents, who encouraged each of them to pursue their own interests.“Will was always the most academic – he went to the local grammar school – whereas I had a short attention  and went to a state school,” says Tom. “But our mum and dad never pressured any of us to follow a particular path. They supported us in whatever we wanted to do. Will always had a passion for theatre and Olivia was always very artistic. I was looking for something creative, too.”William went to Durham University to study theology, but while he was there, he realised directing was his calling. After moving to London, he worked as an assistant at the Almeida and the Barbican before winning a directing residency at the Young Vic theatre and going on to stage productions around the world.Tom was initially unsure where his own passion would take him. “I always loved food, and watched Ready, Steady, Cook religiously growing up, but I didn’t want to be a chef,” he says. “I worked in hotels after leaving school and all I saw was chefs microwaving everything.”William and Olivia have vivid memories of Tom’s teenage experiments in the kitchen. “He went through a phase of making pea soup all the time, and it was delicious,” says Olivia. “He always had the knack of being able to open the fridge and make something simple but lovely out of whatever was in there.”It was after studying hospitality management as a mature student at Surrey University that Tom began working as a chef, getting a job at Alastair Little’s restaurant in Soho. When William went to eat there for the first time, he says: “I felt very proud to sit in a restaurant where Tom was cooking the food.” He worked his way up, then spent six months at trendy Italian restaurant Bocca di Lupo before being recruited as the head chef at Polpo, Russell Norman’s new venture, in 2009. As always, he included his siblings in his achievement.“I remember us going to his flat and him cooking us a sample menu on the small hob, because he’s always wanted our opinion,” says William. “Equally, I often think of Tom and Olivia when I’m working – what they’d like. It stops me getting too lost in what I like.”After her MA in history of art at Sussex University, Olivia joined them in London. Watching her older brothers work so hard to make their ambitions a reality made her more determined to fulfil her own. “Their work ethic is definitely the biggest thing I learned from them,” she says.In 2013, the trio began living together in a house in Shepherd’s Bush, where they were joined by Olivia’s boyfriend and Tom’s fiancee, Meryl Fernandes, an actress and television presenter. “People did think it was a bit weird that we all lived together,” says Olivia with a laugh. “But it was great. We have a similar sense of humour and we have fun together.” William would come to her for advice on his love life, while Tom taught her how to season her cooking properly. The arrangement lasted two years before Tom and William moved to east London. Tom now has a baby daughter with Meryl, who is overseeing the design of his new venture, a Hackney pub, The Duke of Richmond, where he’ll serve French dishes. Olivia is often out of the country preparing touring exhibitions and William is working on several early stage film projects.However busy life becomes, they’ll always make time to support one another’s projects. “They’re so talented,” says William. “It’s fantastic to see the outcome of their hard work.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe9b20f6c2ec30d77d043acf4cd6db9f5475570a/0_152_5259_3157/master/5259.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b34dce6cf50f3d2f5fbf635ed31b610","title":"fate of brett kavanaugh hearing unclear as senate scrambles to set terms","story":"President said he feels ‘terribly’ for nominee as Senate firms up hearing details following sexual assault allegationsDonald Trump again rushed to the defense of embattled supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday, saying he feels “terribly” for the judge as he faces a public hearing over an allegation of sexual assault from a California professor.“I feel so badly for him. This is not a man who deserves this,” Trump said of Kavanaugh at a news conference at the White HouseHe called Kavanaugh a “great gentleman” and said he was sad that his wife and “beautiful young daughters” had to experience a public airing of the accusations.Kavanaugh’s nomination hangs in the balance as Democrats and Republicans clash over the terms of a public hearing scheduled in the wake of an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers.The president said Ford should also have the opportunity to “state her case”, though he believes a public hearing will eliminate any doubt about Kavanaugh’s innocence.Republican leaders, under immense pressure from lawmakers of both parties, have set a public hearing for next Monday at which the judge and the professor are both invited to testify.In a letter, published on Tuesday evening, to Senate judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley, Ford said the FBI should investigate her claims as a “first step” before she testifies.Ford’s attorneys argue that “a full investigation by law enforcement officials will ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner, and that the Committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decisions”.The letter added to growing questions over whether Ford would testify on Monday.Earlier on Tuesday, Grassley said his office had reached out to Ford multiple times about the Monday hearing and had not yet heard back.“It kind of raises the question, do they want to come to the public hearing or not?” Grassley said on conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt’s radio show. He added: “I want to hear from Dr Ford. And she deserves to be heard. I would surely hope she’d come Monday.”Republicans said they offered her a choice to testify in an open or closed hearing.Ford, a 51-year-old research psychologist at Palo Alto University in northern California, alleged in an interview with the Washington Post that Kavanaugh drunkenly pinned her to a bed, groped her and placed his hand over her mouth to prevent her from screaming at a house party in the early 1980s when the two were in high school. Ford said she was able to escape only when a friend jumped on top of them.Kavanaugh, 53, has forcefully denied the allegations and told a senator that he was not present at the party where the alleged assault occurred.Ford’s lawyer, Debra Katz, said on Monday before the hearing was scheduled that her client would be willing to testify. Attorneys for Ford have not returned multiple requests for comment.The timing of the hearing is politically perilous for both parties, with the November midterm election less than two months away. It will also play out against the backdrop of the #MeToo movement, a cultural development that has shone a spotlight on sexual harassment and toppled powerful men in government, entertainment, the media and other businesses.Katz said Ford has been inundated with violent and vulgar emails since she shared her story publicly on Sunday. The New York Times reported that Ford was forced to move out of her house and is hiring private security for herself and her family. She is “effectively in hiding”, the story said, citing a source close to Ford.Democrats assailed the hearing as a “rush job” and demanded the hearing be delayed until the FBI could investigate the matter. They decried a plan to limit testimony to Kavanaugh and Ford, arguing that the committee should also hear from witnesses and experts to avoid a “he said, she said” scenario.Democratic senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York added that a “sham hearing” would send a message that women “are not valued in this country”.One possible witness they want to hear from is Mark Judge, Kavanaugh’s classmate whom Ford said was at the party. But in a letter written by his attorney on Tuesday, Judge told the Judiciary Committee that has no recollection of the incident and does “not wish to speak publicly” about the allegations.The president and Republicans meanwhile have continued to harangue Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein for not disclosing the allegations sooner. The senator, who learned of the accusation in July, said she kept the information private to honor Ford’s request for confidentiality. Ford has said that she only came forward after rumors about the letter began to circulate.The allegation has drawn comparisons to the painful 1991 public testimony of Anita Hill, who accused then supreme court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment.“There is no way to redo 1991, but there are ways to do better,” Hill, now a Brandeis University professor, wrote in a New York Times op-ed Tuesday. She advised the committee to “not rush the hearings” and to bring in “a neutral investigative body with experience in sexual misconduct cases.Meanwhile, Republican senator Susan Collins, seen as a key swing vote that could determine his confirmation, has asked the committee to allocate time during the hearing for Ford’s attorney to question Kavanaugh and for his attorney to question her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/592c28b69f10e8d3989da908920ae7c54d35f865/0_0_6000_3640/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0532f8232d8c981a8fb66b441656b630","title":"surprise truce brokered by turkey and russia spares idlib for now","story":"Surprise initiative welcome respite for Syrian opposition and people of the provinceRelieved locals and rebel groups in Idlib have been trying to unpick details of an eleventh-hour truce that excludes much of the northern Syrian province from a Russian-led attack for at least one month and sets up a buffer zone intended to shield 3 million civilians.The surprise initiative, brokered by Turkey and Russia on Monday, assuages fears of an immediate widespread humanitarian catastrophe and sets the scene for a swathe of northern Syria to remain out of central government control indefinitely.The arrangement strengthens the role of Turkish-backed rebels in the northern province, and is likely to lead hardline groups to make a tactical retreat to southern Idlib where, for now, they will remain out of the sights of Russian and Syrian guns.The move is a welcome respite for Syrian opposition groups, who had feared a massive attack aimed at returning the final rebel-held province to central government control, allowing Bashar al-Assad to clinch victory in the seven-year war.As momentum built towards an attack, Assad’s backers, Russia and Iran, grew increasingly wary of the political price they would end up paying by bringing about a humanitarian crisis unlike any other in the Syrian war.Weeks of belligerent rhetoric from Tehran and Moscow had increasingly softened in recent days and been replaced by common ground with Ankara – a central backer of what remains of the anti-Assad opposition, which has increasingly muscled in on northern Syria and saw its own interests unravelling if chaos was ignited along its border.“Civilians in Idlib think this is a good deal, they feel hopeful and happy concerning it,” said Mahmoud Abbi, a spokesperson for Free Idlib Police, a rebel-backed local police force. “We are grateful for Turkey’s efforts to prevent the Russian and Assad attack on Idlib. However … we do not trust Russia about the deal. But for now it is better than displacement or bombing.“The deal is for Turkey’s security but it is also face-saving for Putin and by association Assad,” he said. “Iran refused to participate in this attack because of its own bad military and economic situation. The Assad regime is weak and has no ability to attack without the help of Iranian militias.”The Assad regime was not represented at the bilateral summit between Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the Russian resort town of Sochi, and not was it present at a trilateral summit with Iran in Tehran one week ago. The Syrian government had no immediate response to the development, which appears likely to consolidate Turkey’s presence in the north, giving Erdogan a stronger hand in managing the final stages of the war – and aftermath.Central to the truce is the removal of an extremist coalition from the buffer zone, the dimensions of which are yet to be finalised. Turkish and Russian intelligence officials will soon meet to thrash out the numbers of radical rebels required to leave the province. The agreement suggests that those who agree to exit will be given safe passage to the eastern Hama desert region.Jawad Abdel Karim, 40, a spokesman for the Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) umbrella group of hardline fighters, said his organisation is, for now, expected to retreat up to 7km (4.3 miles) away from the agreed demarcation point. Forces loyal to the Assad regime, meanwhile, would retreat 10km away. “Give or take, the distance between the opposition and regime will be 15km,” he said.The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammed Zarif, said he welcomed the apparent breakthrough, adding weight to a growing belief that the deal, or a variation of it, would hold. “Intensive responsible diplomacy over the last few weeks-pursued in my visits to Ankara and Damascus, followed by the Iran-Russia-Turkey Summit in Tehran and the meeting in Sochi-is succeeding to avert war in Idlib with a firm commitment to fight extremist terror. Diplomacy works,” Zarif wrote on Twitter.HTS, and earlier incarnations of it, has been a significant presence throughout Idlib for the past three years. It has been particularly strong in the south, but has attempted to impose austere theocratic rule in many towns and cities. The numbers of ideologically driven fighters in its ranks have been difficult to gauge. Thousands of men had joined the organisation because of its strength. But as its momentum wanes, the powerful group is starting to lose impetus in some parts of Idlib.While parts of Idlib appeared to rally behind the truce, not all were convinced that it would hold. “Although we agree with the points mentioned in the agreement between Erdoğan and Putin, have they ever got a result before?” asked Abu Wissam, 32. “Civilians on the ground are still living in fear and worry. We’re all hesitant and we’re all doubtful. And we have nothing to say any more. Our voices went hoarse with demands and no one listened.”Another Idlib local, Ahmed Hallaq, 34, said: We had bigger dreams and goals than this agreement. All of Syria should have been safe from the Assad regime and his militias, not just a buffer zone. Lots of my friends around here think the same. We don’t trust the regime, we have zero trust in its morals and promises. They violated most, if not everything else that’s been agreed on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cf989ff8562ee1165adb5b04a210442463cb314/529_66_6797_4079/master/6797.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=425e1ef0cb7b9f28a1b862cd7c67d3e3","title":"women of the world nomad games in pictures","story":"This year’s World Nomad Games, a celebration of nomadic heritage, took place in the Issyk-Kul province of Kyrgyzstan.

Photograph: Eric VidalFile PhotoReutersNegotiators, officials, advisers and politicians, in Brussels, London and Dublin are bracing themselves for an intensification of activity over the coming weeks as the decisive phase of the Brexit talks approaches.Will there be a backstop, guaranteeing an invisible border? Will there be a withdrawal agreement? Or will the two sides fail to strike an agreement, resulting in a crash-out Brexit next March – and all the disruption, uncertainty and economic damage this outcome would entail?The two sides remain deadlocked on the backstop – the guarantee that there will be no hard border in Ireland – even if there is no agreement between the UK and the EU on a future trade deal. This outcome was promised by both sides in principle in a joint declaration at last December’s summit. But there has been no agreement on how it would be achieved.The EU has suggested that it could be achieved by essentially keeping the North in the single market and customs union after Brexit. This has been rejected by the British on the basis that treating the North differently to the rest of the UK would undermine the UK’s single market and even its constitutional integrity. Instead the UK suggested that a promise to keep the entire UK in the single market and customs union for goods only – and for a limited time – would work as a backstop instead. But this was rejected by the EU as a form of “cherrypicking” – taking the bits of EU membership that the UK likes, but opting out of the bits it doesn’t. And that is not acceptable to the EU.Yesterday British newspapers quoted Brussels sources as saying they believed the British government would have to be faced with the immediate prospect of a no-deal Brexit before they stepped back from their position on the Irish backstop.But senior figures in Dublin believe it is in just these circumstances that the EU side will relent.But sources in London believe the British should keep the border issue alive for as long as possible – including into the intended next phase of the negotiations on the future relationship, where they can use it as leverage in the horse-trading that will dominate the talks on a trade deal.Given all that, the potential for a stand-off in the talks in the coming months is evident. So how does the clock tick down towards midnight?The countdown begins in earnest when European leaders meet for an “informal” summit hosted by the Austrian presidency in Salzburg. However, British hopes that the meeting would signal a shift in the EU’s approach are likely to be dashed. As an informal meeting, there are no written conclusions from the summit, so any change in the negotiating mandate for Michel Barnier is impossible. EU leaders are expected to give encouraging signs about the Chequers proposal, but to reiterate their position about no cherrypicking and the backstop.All eyes will switch to the UK, where the Labour Party meets for its conference in Liverpool and the Conservatives meet in Birmingham. Prime minister Theresa May is expected to stick doggedly to her Chequers plan in the face of fierce criticism – and constant talk of a leadership challenge – from Brexiteers in her party. Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile, will face pressure to commit to a second referendum, while Labour’s position that it will vote against a withdrawal treaty based on the Chequers plan (itself a long shot) is also likely to be challenged by its own ranks.The official – albeit self-imposed – deadline for the withdrawal agreement, and the political declaration on the future relationship to be reached is at the October European Council summit in Brussels. But while October is likely to see frantic work by the negotiating teams, few people on either side believe a deal is likely by the summit. Conclusions are agreed and circulated for approval a few days in advance of the summit, shortening the deadline by another couple of days. However, the October summit may well signal whether an agreement is possible at all. Any change in the EU’s position would have to agreed by leaders at the summit if there is no movement by either side, leaders are likely to emerge with the prospect of a hard Brexit looming much larger.EU sources say that a special Brexit summit, likely to be scheduled for mid-November, is likely if the two sides believe after the October summit that a deal is likely. Under article 50, the terms of the withdrawal treaty must be agreed by EU leaders – strictly speaking, formal unanimity is not required, but in practice the European Council operates by consensus, especially on such significant issues. But the summit would only be scheduled if agreement was more or less certain – and this will depend on the progress in negotiations after the October summit.This is the final European summit of the year in Brussels, and is the last practical date for an agreement to be reached. The withdrawal treaty would have to be ratified by both Westminster and the European Parliament before the end of March, and both could be time-consuming procedures. If there is no agreement by December, then a crash-out Brexit in March will loom, though diplomatic activity is likely to switch to examining the possibility of an extension to article 50, moving the deadline back. But the diplomatic and political damage caused by the failure to reach and agreement would seriously hinder that possibility.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Tom HonanThe  It wasn’t so much a speech as a performance.“Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more,” cried Michael D, galloping back to battle with a small pair of scissors, a length of green ribbon and an extravagant sweep of the arm.Those weren’t the actual words spoken by the President – but it’s the essence of what he said during a rousing 20-minute speech on the ploughing fields of Screggan.There was no time for subtlety in his soliloquy, for not only was he officially opening the National Ploughing Championships, he was also unofficially opening his campaign to win a second term as president of Ireland.Seven years a slave to constitutional constraint can be difficult for any occupant of Áras an Uachtaráin, but it must place a particular strain on somebody like Michael D Higgins, who was always very partial to a blistering political argument.So when he made this latest trip to open the largest outdoor event in Europe this year, he had much more to do than merely cut a ribbon and utter some stirring words about our deep-rooted connection to the land.Michael D was a man on a mission, at the start of a mission.He is not yet officially off the leash, but you wouldn’t have known that on Tuesday. President Higgins was only short of dancing up to the microphone when called upon to speak.“May I say what a great pleasure it is to be here again at . . . the Ploughing!” And with that, he was off, chewing the scenery with quivering gusto, waving around the fistful of papers he would have been consulting had he not sashayed off script within minutes.There was hardly need for amplification as he held forth like a veteran thespian declaiming to the audience at the back of the theatre, only he was standing in the middle of a field, and the back of the house was the Slieve Bloom Mountains.There were extravagant sweeps of the arm and, at one stage, a hand held high in the air like Jim Larkin’s statue in O’Connell Street. Which is fair enough, as big Jim and the 1913 lockout was mentioned in the course of the speech, after which the President launched himself into a simmering throng of admirers in front of the stage.Also mentioned was the 19th-century writer and revolutionary James Fintan Lalor who spoke of the right of the people to live on the land in security, comfort and independence.“We remember him as well as all of the others we paid tribute to over the last few years: Tone and Pearse and Connolly and others,” carolled Michael D, before reflecting on the next period of national commemoration to come next year when “we’ll be celebrating the first Dáil with all its great promise”.A reminder stitched in there for potential voters of how, as President, he presided over the delicate 1916 centenary commemorations.He spoke of the importance of the ploughing festival, which “invites all of the people of Ireland to realise the importance of farming as a way of life and of the importance of sustaining it and addressing its issues in a practical way”.As President Higgins spoke, one of his rivals for the job, Seán Gallagher, stood to one side of the platform, also facing the crowd.The man who came second in the election seven years ago was one of two former Dragons’ Den participants who were also on the Áras trail in the sprawling Screggan grounds.It was a bold move by the candidate, who pressed the flesh and made himself very visible in the vicinity of the President. At midday, when Michael D eventually made it through a crush of well-wishers to the stage, Seán had already strategically positioned himself at the foot of the steps. The President would have to pass by him, but so too did a battalion of men in green IFA blazers augmented by a few more wearing chains of office. They blocked the view. Gallagher moved forward, to no avail. Snubbed?But no. Somebody must have whispered something to Michael D because he turned and belted his way past the blocking blazers and warmly greeted the businessman, thanking him for a note he had sent to him.“So, I’ll see you shortly,” said Seán.“Oh, you will,” replied President Higgins, loudly.He told reporters he will begin his campaign in about a week’s time.“I’ve never run away from a campaign in my life, for goodness sake,” he declared, adding that he had been fighting them for nearly 40 years.Whatever happens, he hoped the campaign would be dignified and about “the real issues”.It was a difficult beat for the three declared candidates who were in Laois for the first day of the championships. Joan Freeman, Gallagher and Gavin Duffy strolled around the stands and exhibitions, doing their best to meet as many people as possible. Duffy’s small team had a big roll of stickers which they tried to hand out to passing children.He was with his wife Orlaith, and they wore matching wellies. Lovely expensive Dubarry boots which were admired by many.They did interviews and did their best to explain how it’s early days and the opinion polls putting Higgins miles ahead are not indicative of how the situation could change as the campaign progresses. Gallagher and Duffy, while expressing undying admiration for the incumbent, stressed the need for him to participate fully in any TV debates.Michael D, for his part, was letting it be known that he is up for the fight. He spent the day visiting stands while his security details, gardaí and a private security firm hired by the National Ploughing Association kept the crowds at bay as best they could. The President was mobbed.Not a good thing for the candidates to see. Screggan belonged to President Higgins. He was the star of the show on Tuesday. They will have to engage on different fronts if they are to peg back his lead. They will. They have to.The only VIP who got a very positive reception and a surprisingly high recognition rate from the crowd was the new Garda Commissioner Drew Harris. He was the recipient of good wishes from many people as he got his first experience of the ploughing.As the afternoon wore on, news came through that a third “dragon” had made the ballot sheet. Peter Casey is the latest alumnus of the business themed entertainment programme to join the chasing pack.What should they be called: A showboat of Dragons? A bluster? A congratulation?Michael D worked his way though a large number of stands. Loving it. He met Jessica McGrath from Monkstown in Dublin who told him her grandmother Maureen Sheehan was delighted to received her 100th birthday cheque from him last Wednesday.Meanwhile, Marie Finneran from Laois managed to get the President to sign a hurley for her son Luka (12), who plays for Four Roads.“It’ll be used in the under-12 county final on Saturday against St Dominick’s,” said Marie.The campaign is under way in earnest.Oh, yes he has.This is going to be fun."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3633648.1537302891!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pac to decide whether to investigate president s spending","story":"Speaking at the 87th Ploughing Championships in Tullamore, Co Offaly, President Michael D Higgins says he hopes the presidential race is dignified and about real issues.

The issue was raised by Independent Senator Gerard Craughwell who said he had received information during the summer that Mr Higgins stayed at the hotel, where top suites are advertised for €3,000 a night. Neither the Áras nor the Department of Foreign Affairs would confirm if Mr Higgins stayed at the Beau-Rivage, or the cost of his accommodation (if any) during his visit. Chairman Sean Fleming confirmed the committee had since then received several requests to examine the allocated finances to the President’s office to determine if there was value for money. The issue will be discussed at the PAC meeting on Thursday. If the committee does decide to examine the President’s spending, the hearing will have to be held next Tuesday. Mr Fleming thinks that if it takes place after Wednesday, September 26th, (when the presidential election campaign has started) it could be seen as political interference. The accounting officer for the President’s office is the Secretary General to the Government, Martin Fraser, who would be required to appear before the committee. Details of spending of the President’s office, including for hotel accommodation, flights and foreign trips, are not ulged to the public.The office is exempt from Freedom of Information requests. However, all foreign trips, including the size of delegations and costs, require the approval of the Government. The overall budget for the President’s office has not changed markedly since Mr Higgins replaced Mary McAleese. Some €1.4 million of its €4.3 million budget is allotted to a financial reward for citizens who reach 100 years of age. Of the remaining €3 million, €1.8 million is allowed for salaries €310,000 is allotted to travel and €340,000 to training and incidental expenses. Mr Higgins took a reduction in salary of €70,000 from Mrs McAleese, and is paid some €250,000 a year. He also gave up his Dáil and ministerial pensions worth €93,000 a year during his time in the Áras.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3633564.1537304513!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"second brexit referendum is possible claims article 50 author","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit secretary Dominic Raab has ruled out a second referendum but Lord John Kerr’s report says it is possible. Photograph: Facundo ArrizabalagaMPs will be able to legislate for a second referendum on Brexit even if Theresa May’s government opposes it, according to a new report by John Kerr, the British diplomat who helped to draft article 50 of the EU treaty. Brexit secretary Dominic Raab this week ruled out a second referendum, which requires legislation in parliament, where Ms May’s government controls the legislative agenda.Lord Kerr’s report, which is published by the People’s Vote campaign for a second referendum, argues that MPs could table amendments to enable legislation for Brexit to demand another referendum. It says that the EU would almost certainly agree to an extension of the article 50 deadline and that the EU treaty allows Britain to withdraw its notification of Brexit.“The die is not irrevocably cast, there is still time and, until the UK has left the EU, the article 50 letter can be withdrawn. If there is a majority in parliament for a People’s Vote, there are multiple routes to securing one and, as the process unfolds, more opportunities for the House of Commons to assert its will may emerge. Should the UK need more time for a People’s Vote, there is little doubt that the other 27 member states would agree the necessary extension of the article 50 timetable,” Lord Kerr said.The report, which draws on the expertise of constitutional expert Vernon Bogdanor, Conservative MP and former attorney general Dominic Grieve and other parliamentarians and academics, identifies a number of opportunities for MPs to trigger a second referendum. They could amend the “meaningful vote” on any deal Ms May brings to parliament and, if that fails, they could try again when a Bill comes before them to implement the withdrawal agreement.If the prime minister fails to secure a deal by January 21st, 2019, she is obliged to report to parliament on how the government intends to proceed. MPs will vote on this in the form of a motion, which the speaker can choose to make amendable.\u0026nbspRecent polls have shown a rise in support for a referendum on the Brexit deal, with YouGov reporting last month that\u0026nbsp45 per cent of voters backed the idea against 35 per cent who oppose it. If Ms May fails to secure a deal and Britain faces the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, support for a second referendum rises to 50 per cent, with 25 per cent opposing it.Business groups in Britain reacted with alarm on Tuesday after the body that advises the government on migration said low-skilled immigration should be curbed after Brexit and EU citizens should not be treated differently from others. The Migration Advisory Committee said there should be no cap on high-skilled immigration but low-skilled workers from the EU should face the same, tough restrictions as those from other countries.The committee said that any special treatment for EU citizens after Brexit would only be justified if it was part of a free-trade agreement.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Ian Howells,\u0026nbspHonda Europe’s senior vice president, told the BBC: “We’d probably be looking at something like 60,000 additional bits of documentation we would have to provide to get products to and from Europe.”He added: “If we end up with WTO tariffs, we’d have something like 10 per cent costs in addition to our shipped product back into Europe and that’d certainly run into tens of millions.“And likewise\u0026nbspwhen we’re looking at componentry coming the other way, again tens of millions in terms of tariffs potentially coming into the UK.”This would have an impact on productivity and competitiveness, Mr Howells said, particularly up against European rivals. However, the Swindon plant is the only place where the Civic is produced, so it would be a “very big decision to take a different approach”. Raab: Those fearing Brexit hit to car industry should show ‘mettle’Government urged to stop ‘squabbling’ and save UK car industryInvestment in UK car industry halves because of Brexit“Really it hasn’t come up that we would actually have to look at putting Swindon elsewhere,” he said. “The logistics of moving a factory the size of Swindon would be huge and as far as we’re concerned, we’re right behind supporting continued production at Swindon.”The Honda executive’s remarks follow Jaguar Land Rover’s decision to move workers at its Castle Bromwich plant to a three-day week because of “continuing headwinds impacting the car industry”. Ralf Speth, Jaguar’s boss, last week warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK motor industry are at risk if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead.He also said the current lack of clarity around Brexit means he does not know if his plants will be able to function after 29 March 2019, and added that interruptions to production could cost up to £60m a day.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/09/27/09/angela-rayner.jpg","title":"off rolling schools labour party angela rayner exclusions gcse exam results","story":"Created with Sketch.‘Some of the most vulnerable children are being let down by an increasingly fragmented system’Click to followThe IndependentAngela Rayner says the Labour Party will tackle ‘off-rolling’ in schoolsThe Labour Party has vowed to tackle the scandal of “off-rolling” – where students are removed from the school register in a bid to improve exam results and league table ratings.\u0026nbspAngela Rayner,\u0026nbspthe shadow education secretary, announced that Labour would make schools accountable for the exam results of students who leave until they find another permanent school.The proposal hopes to remove the “perverse incentive” where schools benefit from losing pupils, ensuring that no school is able to get rid of a pupil without consequence, the party said.\u0026nbspIt comes after Ofsted\u0026nbspraised concerns about “off-rolling” amid allegations that some schools are playing the system and getting rid of students who might do badly in their GCSEs.Recent analysis from the\u0026nbspschools watchdog\u0026nbspidentified 300 schools with high levels of pupil movement between year 10 and the time that they sit their GCSE exams – and it found half of the 19,000 pupils who left a school between year 10 and 11 last year did not reappear at another state school.Speaking ahead of the Labour Party conference next week, Ms Rayner said: “Teachers and heads want to do the best for all their pupils but too often they find themselves caught in a system that doesn’t reward them for doing the right thing.\u0026nbsp“As it is, some of the most vulnerable are being let down or falling between the gaps of an increasingly fragmented system and out of education altogether. There needs to be a clear responsibility for these children, and accountability for their educational outcomes.”Labour would also like to close a funding loophole that\u0026nbspallows schools to receive funding for pupils before they are counted towards exam results – as they say it creates a window in which pupils can be off-rolled without consequences for the school.Ms Rayner added: “We must all take responsibility for our must vulnerable children, and that is why we will be reforming the accountability system to support them, while working with schools to move towards a system that is cooperative and does not drive workload, and giving them the resources they need to support all their pupils.“That is why Labour will close the loopholes and end the perverse incentives. This will ensure that there is no unintended reward for so-called off-rolling and give schools an investment in ensuring that excluded pupils move on to the best possible provision.”\u0026nbspAs Labour made the announcement, the headteacher of the school featured in TV series Educating Greater Manchester resigned\u0026nbspafter allegedly being accused of\u0026nbspdeliberately “off-rolling” students.Drew Povey, who was executive head\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspHarrop Fold School, criticised the council\u0026nbspfor taking a “heavy handed” approach\u0026nbspwhen they suspended him in July over what he deemed to be administrative errors.In a post on Twitter, Mr Povey said\u0026nbsptwo to three pupils had been incorrectly coded as “off-roll” – but he insisted\u0026nbspthe school did not gain financially and\u0026nbspit had a “negligible” impact on exam results.Salford Council\u0026nbsprefutes the allegation that the suspension was\u0026nbspa “personal vendetta” against Mr Povey.UK news in picturesCar manufacturer BMW announced on September 18, 2018, that its Mini factory in the UK would close for its annual summer maintenance several weeks earlier than planned, starting on April 1, 2019, to avoid any disruption in case of a no-deal Brexit.It\u0027s either my deal or no deal, the Prime Minister has said to the BBC\u0027s Nick Robinson in an interview on Panorama that airs this evening.

Only Latvia, Slovakia and the Czech Republic had job satisfaction as low as England, the report finds.Fifteen of the countries where reasonable comparisons can be made – which include Israel, Sweden and the US\u0026nbsp– had “much higher” teacher job satisfaction than in England.Researchers analysed data from more than 100,000 teachers who had taken part in the most recent Teaching and Learning International Survey - including nearly 2,500 teachers from England.Teacher job satisfaction in England is lower than in almost every other country where a robust comparison can be made,” the report concluded.Dr Sam Sims, who led the research at UCL IoE, called it a “wake up call”. He said: “It is not surprising that so many teachers are leaving the profession when morale is this low.”Research shows teachers become dissatisfied with work if they are not given the freedom to get on with their jobs. But teachers in England have seen a big increase in paperwork and data entry in recent years. Cutting red tape would help restore morale in the profession,” he said.Teachers were asked four questions measuring whether they enjoyed their work, whether they would recommend their job to others, whether they would like to leave their school, and their level of satisfaction with their working life. These were combined to create a single job satisfaction score.The data was collected in 2013 but the researchers said that declining rates of teacher retention since then suggest that the situation is unlikely to have improved much in recent years.Kevin Courtney, general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), said: “This is no surprise. Teacher workload is simply unmanageable, particularly due to the current unnecessary accountability regime in schools.\u0026nbsp“This data relates to 2013 and we know that workload and resignation rates have gone up even further since then. \u0026nbsp“Workload, low pay and a stifling and uncreative curriculum are driving many teachers out of the profession altogether. \u0026nbsp“For the sake of children’s education the Government must address these fundamental issues and make teaching a profession that people want to join and stay in.”UK news in picturesCar manufacturer BMW announced on September 18, 2018, that its Mini factory in the UK would close for its annual summer maintenance several weeks earlier than planned, starting on April 1, 2019, to avoid any disruption in case of a no-deal Brexit.It\u0027s either my deal or no deal, the Prime Minister has said to the BBC\u0027s Nick Robinson in an interview on Panorama that airs this evening.

They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together before1724 Dog-sized horned dinosaur fossil found shows east-west evolutionary ide in North AmericaA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the study1924 Life on Earth appeared hundreds of millions of years earlier than previously thoughtLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.2124 Earth could be at risk of meteor impactsEarth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur2324 Researchers discover \u0027lost world\u0027 of arctic dinosaursScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”.

The scientists tracked a star about as big as our sun as it was pulled from its normal path and into that of a supermassive black hole before being eaten up. They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together before1724 Dog-sized horned dinosaur fossil found shows east-west evolutionary ide in North AmericaA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the study1924 Life on Earth appeared hundreds of millions of years earlier than previously thoughtLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.2124 Earth could be at risk of meteor impactsEarth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur2324 Researchers discover \u0027lost world\u0027 of arctic dinosaursScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”2424 A team of filmmakers in the US have made the first ever scale model of the Solar System in a Nevada desertIllustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.In fact, the same chemical pathways help regulate a range of other cell functions in the body, including hair growth.The researchers focused on a receptor called OR2AT4, which is known to be stimulated by Sandalore, and which can be found in the outer layer of hair follicles.Intriguingly, the results suggest that human hair follicles can “smell”, in the sense that they make use of ancient smell receptors to control key functions such as growth.With millions of men and women in the UK affected by hair loss, demand for a “baldness cure” is high. Despite some promising studies over the years, many do not make it beyond the confines of the research lab.According to Professor Paus, however, his latest discovery is “not far at all” from being applied in a clinical context for hair loss.“Sandalore is already offered as a cosmetic product in Italy by the company that has co-sponsored the current study,” he said.Now, the researchers have a larger scale, professionally-controlled clinical trial underway, and they expect to see results by the beginning of next year.Dr Nicola Clayton of the British Association of Dermatologists, who was not involved in the study, said: “It is a fascinating concept that the human hair follicle, as the authors put it, can “smell” by utilising an olfactory receptor.”She said the group’s data was “very exciting”, although noted that from clinical perspective she could only speculate about the extent to which such a treatment would improve outcomes for patients.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/27/12/jet-capsule.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3906706  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/27/12/jet-capsule.jpg","title":"ios 12 release time when iphone update how download new features latest","story":"Created with Sketch.Related video: All the new releases announced by AppleiOS 12 release time: When the new iPhone update arrives and how to download itIt might be worth waiting a few hours, thoughClick to followThe Independent TechApple\u0027s latest iPhone software update is about to arrive.Just a few days after the company revealed its brand new iPhone Xs, Xs Max and Xr, it\u0027s giving everyone else a load of new iPhone features on their old handset too.

The company said, however, it remains committed to its Swindon operation, which employs 4,000 people. The group uses millions of parts sourced from other EU countries at the Swindon plant, where the Civic is manufactured, and said a no-deal Brexit would create a “significant” burden in terms of bringing parts into the country, as well as delivering cars to the rest of Europe. Ian Howells,\u0026nbspHonda Europe’s senior vice president, told the BBC: “We’d probably be looking at something like 60,000 additional bits of documentation we would have to provide to get products to and from Europe.”He added: “If we end up with WTO tariffs, we’d have something like 10 per cent costs in addition to our shipped product back into Europe and that’d certainly run into tens of millions.“And likewise\u0026nbspwhen we’re looking at componentry coming the other way, again tens of millions in terms of tariffs potentially coming into the UK.”This would have an impact on productivity and competitiveness, Mr Howells said, particularly up against European rivals. However, the Swindon plant is the only place where the Civic is produced, so it would be a “very big decision to take a different approach”. Raab: Those fearing Brexit hit to car industry should show ‘mettle’Government urged to stop ‘squabbling’ and save UK car industryInvestment in UK car industry halves because of Brexit“Really it hasn’t come up that we would actually have to look at putting Swindon elsewhere,” he said. “The logistics of moving a factory the size of Swindon would be huge and as far as we’re concerned, we’re right behind supporting continued production at Swindon.”The Honda executive’s remarks follow Jaguar Land Rover’s decision to move workers at its Castle Bromwich plant to a three-day week because of “continuing headwinds impacting the car industry”. Ralf Speth, Jaguar’s boss, last week warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK motor industry are at risk if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead.He also said the current lack of clarity around Brexit means he does not know if his plants will be able to function after 29 March 2019, and added that interruptions to production could cost up to £60m a day.Enter your email addressFill out this

We must change that.”\u0026nbspTurning his attention to Brexit, Sir Vince said: “The Brexit date may be 29 March, but it is only a maybe. Brexit is not inevitable. It can and it must be stopped.”He called on Theresa May to “shock us all” by offering a second public vote on any deal she should return from Brussels with, but said it would be “far easier for Jeremy Corbyn to be brave on Brexit”.“This is his big chance,” he said. “He used to be the campaigning backbencher who joined us in opposing the Iraq war and defending civil liberties.\u0026nbspPeople\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march“In his new role he has kept his hands clean and his image polished by hiring hard left bootboys and girls to do his dirty work.”Sir Vince continued: “If Jeremy Corbyn will not say ‘I will support a People’s Vote and I will fight Brexit’, Labour members should wave him goodbye. He is currently letting down the many people in Labour’s heartland who now see Brexit for what it is.”Lashing out at the hardline Brexiteers, he accused them of ignoring\u0026nbspyears of “economic pain” to justify the “erotic spasm” of withdrawing from the European Union.\u0026nbspBrexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union In the speech, Sir Vince also said that he does not accept that it “is some form of racism to want immigration to be managed like other parts of the economy” but said the public had to realise that it has not depressed wages.\u0026nbsp“I have personal experience of racism,” he told the party faithful. “I embarked on a mixed marriage in this country when racism was rife. My wife and children were being denounced as people whose very presence here would lead to rivers foaming with blood.\u0026nbsp“And I was thrown out of the parental home. So I will never waver in my commitment to call out and stand out racism in all its forms.”But, he added: “We must understand that to dismiss all Brexit voters as racists is simply wrong and utterly counterproductive.”\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/08/qr-code.jpg","title":"china uyghur muslims xinjiang province qr codes security crackdown hrw","story":"Created with Sketch.Officials\u0026nbspcollect\u0026nbspbiometric data including DNA and voice samples,\u0026nbspformer residents sayClick to followThe IndependentA government official scans the code outside a home in Xinjiang provinceChina is installing QR codes on the homes of the\u0026nbspUyghur\u0026nbspMuslim community in order to get instant access to the personal details of people living there, according to a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW).\u0026nbspThe development comes as part of a mass security crackdown on\u0026nbspminorities in Xinjiang province, the charity said,\u0026nbspwhich includes arbitrary detentions, daily restrictions on religious practice and “forced political indoctrination”.\u0026nbspOfficials reportedly scan the “smart” doorplates with mobile devices before entering homes to monitor the inhabitants.Inside China’s ‘re-education centres’ for Uighur MuslimsChina must ‘immediately’ free Muslims from alleged camps, UN saysChina’s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedSophie Richardson, China director at HRW, said: “The Chinese government is committing human rights abuses in Xinjiang on a scale unseen in the country in decades.“The campaign of repression in Xinjiang is a key test of whether the United Nations and concerned governments will sanction an increasingly powerful China to end this abuse.”Authorities claim the codes – which in some locales feature on every home – help with population control and delivery of services.\u0026nbsp“Starting from spring 2017, in every home where one enters there’s a QR code,” one former resident who left Xinjiang, in the far west of the country, told HRW.\u0026nbspFormer residents said authorities are also collecting biometric data, such as DNA and voice samples, when people apply for passports or ID cards,\u0026nbspor during police interrogations.\u0026nbsp“They did take our DNA samples\u0026nbspand iris scans when we applied for the passports,” a middle-aged woman who left Xinjiang last year said. “For those who can read, they read out from a paper but for those who cannot, they said, ‘You can sing a song or tell a story and we will record you’.

His measured comments erged from an earlier, furious response.\u0026nbspIn the early morning, the Russian Defence Ministry intimated the plane had been hit\u0026nbspby Israeli or French fire. Later, spokesmen changed the story, accepting the plane had been shot down by the Syrians. But\u0026nbspthey ratcheted up the diplomatic fury.\u0026nbspIn quick succession, Moscow said Russians had died as a result of Israel’s “irresponsible actions.” It blamed the Israeli command for giving just a minute’s advance warning of its air strikes. It accused their pilots of using the larger Il-20 plane as cover during missions. It summoned the Israeli ambassador to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Smolenskaya Square and it gave Israel’s defence minister a public dressing-down.\u0026nbsp“The actions of the Israeli defence ministry do not reflect the spirit of the Russian-Israeli partnership,” Sergei Shoigu, the\u0026nbspRussian minister of defence\u0026nbsptold Israeli opposite number, Avigdor Lieberman. “We reserve the right to take further steps.”\u0026nbspThe fierce response suggested a difficult period ahead for Russian-Israeli relations.\u0026nbspUntil that point, cooperation between the two countries had been close. In May, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended Victory Day celebrations in Moscow in\u0026nbspa symbolic gesture at the height of the Kremlin’s international isolation. Russia also seemed to accept Israel’s strategic interests in the region.\u0026nbsp“There was a lot of trust between the two sides,” said Yuri Barmin, an expert at the Russian International Affairs Council on Tuesday. “It was seriously undermined today.”The incident brought back memories of November 2015, when a Turkish fighter shot down a Russian Su-24 jet that had violated Turkish airspace. Russia retaliated with sanctions and seven months of hostile relations\u0026nbspensued.Moscow is trying to be friends with everyone –\u0026nbspwith Assad, Israel, Turkey, the Kurds. That, of course, is the source of the problem\u0026nbspSome of Russia’s more excitable politicians suggested\u0026nbspMoscow could respond\u0026nbspby supplying\u0026nbspDamascus with more advanced C-300 anti aircraft systems – a kind that would prove more problematic for Israeli planners.\u0026nbsp“Russia simply can’t let this drop,” said Franz Klintsevich, member of the Russian senate’s Defence Committee.\u0026nbspBut the likelihood of a serious military response from Russia was always low. Even if it wanted to, Russia does not have the capacity to close Syrian air space to Israeli jets.More fundamentally, it was never going to wade into the undeclared war between Israel and Iran.\u0026nbsp“Russia will not stand in the way of Israeli operations to stop Iranian expansion, knowing how existential they are seen in Jerusalem,” said Jonathan Spyer, research fellow at the Jerusalem Institute of Strategic Studies. “Moscow is trying to be friends with everyone – with Assad, Israel, Turkey, the Kurds.\u0026nbspThat, of course, is the source of the problem.”\u0026nbspRussia-Turkey deal over buffer zone in Idlib met with scepticismUN warns of ‘worst humanitarian disaster’ of 21st century in SyriaRussia ‘resumes airstrikes’ on Syria’s Idlib despite Trump warningIn his afternoon comments, Mr Putin urged\u0026nbspagainst a direct comparison to the Turkish Su-24 incident. That was an intentional strike he said this was “an accident.”\u0026nbspThe president’s unexpectedly\u0026nbspmild response brought into question how much of the initial show of anger against Israel was real – and how much a tactic of\u0026nbspdeflection\u0026nbspfrom a military that had made mistakes.“Russia understood it has only itself to blame for not making sure the Syrians had the right friend-or-foe identification systems,” said Vladimir Frolov, a security expert and former Kremlin advisor.\u0026nbspThere were\u0026nbspother, more obvious questions to be asked. How was it that communication with Syrian allies broke down? How could an anti aircraft system mistake a large reconnaissance plane for a fighter jet?Part of the answer lay in the technology, suggested Justin Bronk, a research fellow at RUSI, an international defence and security think tank based in London.\u0026nbspDesigned in the Soviet Union in the 1950s, the Syrian S-200 surface to air missile unit is not a failproof system, he said. Without newer fire control and radar systems, it would have had difficulty differentiating between the two planes.A lax approach to firing the missiles may also have played a role.\u0026nbsp“During recent attacks, the Syrians have tried to give their public an impression of having effective defences,” said Mr Bronk. “So they have fired missiles blindly – on simple ballistic trajectories, or at least with very weak firing solutions. That may have contributed.”In a statement released on Twitter, the Israeli Defence Forces said the blame for the incident lay “firmly with the Syrian regime,” which had fired missiles “indiscriminately” in response to Israeli\u0026nbspairstrikes.\u0026nbspRussia understood it has only itself to blame for not making sure the Syrians had the right friend-or-foe identification systems\u0026nbspBut the statement also expressed “sorrow for the death of the aircrew members of the Russian plane”.\u0026nbspThat show of humility may have given Mr Putin enough to move on.\u0026nbsp“The operational dynamic may change slightly, but the politics can’t change,” added Mr Barmin. “Russian doesn’t have so many allies that it can throw one of them\u0026nbspunder the\u0026nbspbus.”\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/21/un-1.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/21/un-1.jpg","title":"putin erdogan syria idlib sochi russia turkey talks","story":"Created with Sketch.Gathering is second in 10 days for the Turkish and Russian leadersClick to followThe IndependentBattle for Syria\u0027s last major rebel bastion on hold as Putin and Erdogan meet to discuss next movesThe leaders of Turkey and Russia are meeting in Sochi on Monday for hastily arranged talks\u0026nbspover the fate of Syria’s last major rebel stronghold.For now the impending\u0026nbspoffensive on Idlib province, touted for weeks by Damascus and its Russian and Iranian backers, appears to be on hold as a result of Turkish diplomatic agitation and military manoeuvres.Turkey is struggling to prevent an onslaught by pro-Damascus forces on the rebel-held Idlib province, but its moves may have also escalated the potential dangers of the conflict.“We will continue our efforts with Iran and with Russia,” Turkey’s foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said at a press conference in Islamabad late last week. “We will continue our efforts on international platforms as well.”In recent days, Turkey has begun fortifying positions in Idlib ahead of the Russian-backed Syrian government offensive. Turkey\u0026nbsphas amassed armoured vehicles, artillery guns, and tanks along the border with Syria, with some equipment moving across the frontier, according to Turkish news outlets and video footage posted to the internet.It has transferred arms and ammunition to its Free Syria Army (FSA) rebel allies, pro-Ankara newspapers reported, though some experts say the distribution of weapons won’t affect the outcome of any conflict. \u0026nbspIdlib province on 11 September in anticipation for an upcoming government forces offensive (Getty)Turkey has also begun to bolster a dozen outposts it operates in and around Idlib with additional troops and military vehicles.

But Turkey’s moves have upped the geopolitical cost of any attempt to take Idlib by the pro-Assad camp that includes Russia, Iran, and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, as well as Iraqi Shia militias backed by Tehran.Around three\u0026nbspmillion Syrians live in Idlib province, a hilly agricultural region by\u0026nbspthe Turkish border. Many of the displaced have resettled in the province from other parts of the country or were forcibly relocated there from opposition enclaves recaptured by Damascus.Turkey, the primary patron of the Syrian opposition and the host to 3.5 million displaced Syrians, has vehemently opposed the regime offensive to retake Idlib. The US and Europe have urged a political solution over Idlib and warned against the military campaign. US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley repeated warnings that any use of chemical weapons by the regime would trigger a response by Washington.The UK on Saturday warned of an impending humanitarian crisis amid reports of attacks on hospitals and clinics in rebel-held territory. “The UK has been clear that a man-made catastrophe in Idlib is entirely avoidable,” Alistair Burt, Middle East minister, said in a a press release. “We support the urgent diplomatic efforts being made by Turkey and the UN.”Ankara worries in part that another bloody confrontation in Syria could flood Turkey and Europe with hundreds of thousands of fresh refugees.Airstrikes in in Idlib, northwestern SyriaAlready, thousands of displaced Syrians have relocated from the southern edges of Idlib and northern Hama province to the Turkish-controlled Afrin district adjacent to the border, said a source in Afrin. On Friday, Turkey hosted a meeting of French, German\u0026nbspand Russian officials ahead of a possible meeting of those countries’ leaders over Idlib.In addition to a possible confrontation between pro-Assad forces and Turkey, Idlib could be the flashpoint for a conflict with jihadi forces that dominate parts of the province. In recent days, al-Qaeda’s international supporters on social media have also blasted fellow jihadis in Idlib for allowing Turkey to dispatch armoured vehicles and trucks carrying tanks into Syria, as depicted in videos posted on social media.A 13 September statement signed by 15 prominent al-Qaeda supporters questioned Hayat Tahrir\u0026nbspal-Sham (HTS), the jihadi group that is a dominant player in Idlib, for granting Turkey access to the province.Mr Oliver suggested Turkey could be bolstering the observation points for fear of attacks by jihadis as well as to stymie Damascus’s offensive. “The internal problems for Idlib are huge,” he said. “We are talking about an area that has FSA factions, HTS, you have Isis\u0026nbspcells, you have other small entities.”For now Turkey’s moves have complicated plans to retake Idlib. Syrian civilians have begun to mass around the bolstered observation points in hopes that they won’t be struck by government and Russian warplanes. Thousands of Syrians who have fled the attacks of the regime and Russia are settling in the areas where the Turkish army\u0027s military posts are, because they think it is safe, the pro-government Vatan newspaper reported, publishing photos showing people purported to be sheltering near the outposts.On Friday, for the second week in a row, thousands of Syrians in the province took to the streets in peaceful, colourful demonstrations that recalled the first months of the 2011 uprising against the Assad family’s decades-long dictatorship. “For the time being, everything is postponed,” Mr Oliver said. “There is no final agreement and no final disagreement.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/07/15/251230075-files-this-photograph-taken-on-september-12-2017-shows-rohingya-refugees-arriving-by-boat.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/07/15/251230075-files-this-photograph-taken-on-september-12-2017-shows-rohingya-refugees-arriving-by-boat.jpg","title":"un myanmar rohingya genocide united nations","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followThe IndependentInternational Criminal Court to investigate Myanmar’s Rohingya deportationsThe International Criminal Court (ICC) has launched a preliminary investigation into the Rohingya crisis to determine whether the mass deportations of Muslims from Myanmar into Bangladesh was a crime against humanity.Chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbspif the evidence collected in the initial probe was sufficient, it would pave the way for a full-blown investigation.Myanmar\u0027s military has been accused of a horrifying list of\u0026nbspviolations, including rape, murder, torture and the burning of Rohingya villages, leading about 700,000 people to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.Ms Bensouda said she will look at reports of “a number of alleged coercive acts having resulted in the forced displacement of the Rohingya people, including deprivation of fundamental rights, killing, sexual violence, enforced disappearance, destruction and looting”.Suu Kyi defends jailing of journalists who covered Rohingya killingsICC rules it can investigate crimes against RohingyaJournalists covering Rohingya crisis jailed for seven years in MyanmarAlthough Myanmar is not a member of the Hague-based court, Bangladesh is.

Angela Merkel on collision course with voters on new immigration planWith immigration adding one million to our population every three years this simply cannot go on.He also warned that the loose definition of high skilled labour in the report means \u0026ldquothese proposals would permit continued high levels of immigration, including those with medium skills from all over the world.He added: \u0026ldquoThe overall outcome would be to weaken immigration control rather than strengthen it.The report was drawn up after ministers asked experts to carry out an in-depth analysis on the patterns and impact of migration from the European Economic Area in July last year to help them draw up proposed new rules for after the implementation period ends in December 2020.EU nationals must face same rules to enter the UK as people from the rest of the world (Image: getty)High skilled migrants should be able to easily fill vital roles in the UK (Image: getty)The Migration Advisory Committee\u0027s (MAC) final report says that, if immigration is not part of the negotiations with the EU and the UK is deciding its future system in isolation, there should be no preference given to EU citizens.It says: A migrant\u0027s impact depends on factors such as their skills, employment, age and use of public services, and not fundamentally on their nationality.The committee emphasised that it was not expressing a view on whether immigration should be part of the negotiations.MAC chairman Professor Alan Manning said: If - and this is not an MAC recommendation - immigration is not to be part of the negotiations with the EU and the UK is deciding its future migration system in isolation, we recommend moving to a system in which all migration is managed with no preferential access to EU citizens.                BBC host forced to intervene as Farage issues BRUTAL response to SNP                BBC host SHUTS down SNP politician for being \u0027OUT OF STEP\u0027 with ScotsThis would mean ending free movement but that would not make the UK unusual, he said, citing Canada\u0027s approach as an example.Prof Manning added: The problem with free movement is that it leaves migration to the UK solely up to migrants and UK residents have no control over the level and mix of migration.The review also suggested the future immigration policy should favour high-skilled workers as there is clear evidence they bring benefits to the UK\u0027s public finances, innovation and productivity.But in a finding that is likely to spark opposition from some sectors, the MAC concludes that there is no need for a specific migration route for low-skilled work, with the possible exception of a seasonal agricultural scheme.The report recommends that a cap on the number of Tier 2 skilled work visas should be scrapped and the scheme opened up to migrants in medium-skilled posts.Business groups such as the CBI, who have pushed for the UK to Remain in the EU and a continuation of free movement to attract even more cheap labour, were critical of the report.Matthew Fell, UK policy director of the CBI, said: \u0026ldquoThe current non-EU visa system is highly bureaucratic and cannot be extended to EU workers without major reform, so the MAC is right to recommend scrapping the tier 2 cap. But these proposals don\u0026rsquot go far enough.Earlier this month, Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he would publish a white paper soon after the MAC\u0027S findings are released.

Illegal green belt sites \u0027rented to homeless and EU migrants\u0027In return, she will call on associations to use their community links, expertise and ability to ride out market cycles to achieve things neither private developers nor local authorities are capable of doing.She will continue: I\u0026rsquom asking housing associations to use the tools we have given you - not just to build more homes, though of course more homes are needed, but to take the lead in transforming the very way in which we think about and deliver housing in this country.Rather than simply acquiring a proportion of the properties commercial developers build, I want to see housing associations taking on and leading major developments themselves, because creating the kind of large-scale, high-quality developments this country needs requires a special kind of leadership - leadership you are uniquely well-placed to provide, she will tell them.She will also urge them to help change how tenants and wider society view social housing.For many people, a certain stigma still clings to social housing. Some residents feel marginalised and overlooked, and are ashamed to share the fact that their home belongs to a housing association or local authority, she is expected to say.And on the outside, many people in society, including too many politicians, continue to look down on social housing and, by extension, the people who call it their home.We should never see social housing as something that need simply be \u0027good enough\u0027, nor think that the people who live in it should be grateful for their safety net and expect no better.I want to see social housing that is so good people are proud to call it their home. Our friends and neighbours who live in social housing are not second-rate citizens.Mrs May\u0027s speech will be seen as part of her determination to show she has an energetic domestic policy agenda that goes beyond Brexit.

This represents a total step change.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoFor years, the way that money was allocated meant housing associations couldn\u0026rsquot be sure of long-term funding to build much-needed affordable housing.Now, by changing the way in which they allocate funding, ministers have given long-term confidence and confirmed that we are trusted partners in solving the housing crisis, building new homes and communities.Ultimately, this will have a huge impact on building the affordable homes that thousands of people across the country desperately need.

The ball is little bit in the other court now.

So I think she will succeed, said Mr Hunt.Of course, Boris Johnson doesn\u0027t agree with some of the policy decisions that she\u0027s taken, but Theresa May has to speak not just for the 52 per cent who voted for Brexit, she has to speak for 100 per cent of the country and she has to find a way that builds bridges and unifies the country and that\u0027s what I\u0027m confident she will do.Mr Hunt was the first British government minister to make a speech in Japanese, which he learned in the country as a young man in the 1990s. He was on guard to avoid a repeat of his gaffe in China earlier this year when he tried to impress his hosts with the information that his wife is Chinese, only to refer to her by mistake as Japanese.Theresa May will warn EU leaders that Brussels must offer concessions to the UK to ensure a Brexit deal.In a speech over dinner at an EU summit in Austria, the Prime Minister will insist that the UK had conceded enough in the Brexit negotiations so far and the bloc must now respond,She is expected to point out that the UK has evolved its position in the talks, so the EU must do the same to get a successful conclusion.She will say that goodwill and determination on both sides are needed on both sides to avoid a a disorderly exit and reach a deal that is in the best interests of both sides.She will also say that neither side in the talks can be expected to breach their red line commitments.Neither side can demand the unacceptable of the other, such as an external customs border between different parts of the United Kingdom.No other country would accept it if they were in the same situation, a Government source said ahead of the informal gathering of EU leaders at Salzburg.Mrs May will say the EU must respect the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK and so cannot accept any attempt to put a customs border across the Irish Sea.The official said: Similarly, the UK understands that to the EU it would be unacceptable for us to seek the rights of EU membership without the obligations. That is not what we are doing.Mrs May will say the UK is proposing a fair arrangement that works for the UK and European economies without undermining the EU\u0027s Single Market.She is add that the arrangement will be balanced by a strong security relationship to keep all our citizens safe from threats at home and abroad.

Heres what you need to know.After a marathon session of talks at Chequers on July 6, Theresa May managed to secure a Brexit plan which will be assessed by the EU.Her Brexit plan will see the UK remains closely tied to the Brussels.It also includes the creation of a new UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a common rulebook.This rulebook could limit the UKs ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US, for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize.Mrs May has agreed to an amendment that would stop Britain being tied to Europes customs union after we quit the EU.In dramatic scenes in the House of Commons on July 17 2018, Mrs May managed to see off a damaging attempt, winning by just six votes.Mrs May was then defeated on a separate amendment to her flagship Trade Bill, which will require her to seek continued UK participation in the EUs system for regulation of medicines after Brexit.Now her Cabinet is required to ensure that the UK can continue to participate in the regulatory network operated by the European Medicines Agency.Mrs May hopes to get an agreement hammered out at a series of summits with EU leaders this autumn, and bring it back to Parliament for approval.A deal on the UKs withdrawal agreement was expected to be agreed in time for the summit in October, along with a statement from both sides on the future relationship.However, a number of senior figures have said this deadline may slide into November.Once a dead has been agreed, MPs will be asked to approve it.In a Panorama interview in September 2018 she said MPs had a simple choice between her Chequers plan or no deal.She told the BBC current affairs programme: I think that the alternative to that [the Chequers plan] will be not having a deal.The former Foreign Secretary claimed Mrs Mays disastrous plans for the Irish border would leave Britain at a loss.Boris Johnson said the European Unions fallback position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland was annexed by Brussels.Opposition to the plan in the Conservative Party centres around the European Research Group of hard - Brexit supporting MPs led by Jacob Rees - Mogg.His voice had been among the loudest voicing their objection to the plan and he urged MPs “chuck Chequers”.Up to 80 Tory MPs are prepared to vote against Theresa Mays Chequers plan, Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister and ERG backer has warned.A group of about 50 Tory MPs have met to discuss how and when they could force her out of her job, the BBC reported.Also voicing his opposition to the Chequers deal has been former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.He said Theresas Mays had wrapped a suicide vest around the British constitution and handed the detonator to Brussels.Along with former Brexit secretary David Davis and Mr Johnson resigned in protest following the Chequers meeting.Several other MPs also quit their ministerial posts over the issue, including Steve Baker, Maria Caulfield, Ben Bradley and Robert Courts.The party will vote down any Brexit deal brought back from Brussels by Theresa May, according to shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry.The Corbyn ally said the party will oppose it to try to force an election by Christmas.Speaking to the FT she said a deal which meets her party’s tests was “not going to happen”, and therefore the Prime Minister would be forced to quit.Without the support of the opposition party, it would need just a handful of Tory rebels to vote against her to see it defeated.Theresa Mays initial plans brought her on side with those Conservatives who favour a soft Brexit.The Prime Minister has also been seeking grassroots Tory support for the plan.Among those voicing support for the Prime Minister has been Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who was a prominent member of the Leave campaign.He said he was confident that the Prime Minister will go into the Conservative Party conference and beyond, securing a good Brexit deal for Britain and continuing to ensure the country enjoys good economic growth and we take advantage of Brexit.A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433299296.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"biggest hurricanes history wilma katrina florence","story":"The same weather system is called a cyclone in the Indian Ocean and a typhoon in the western Pacic Ocean.The Great Hurricane of 1780 is regarded as being the deadliest on record and resulted in the death of 20,000 people.The hurricane occurred before the advent of modern storm tracking technology so many details are unclear, such as its exact strength and where it originated.It is, however, believed to have first made landfall on October 10 in Barbados, where it killed 4,500 people, before sweeping over much of the rest of the Caribbean.The hurricane stripped the bark off trees and left none standing on the island and meteorologists have estimated the damage was caused by winds in excess of 200 mph.There were also reports of heavy cannons being thrown 100 feet into the air.As well as Barbados, Martinique and St. Lucia were hardest hit, and there were thousands of casualties on these islands, along with signicant damage to property.The deadliest hurricane to hit the United States was in 1900 when 12,000 people died in the city of Galveston, Texas, about a third of its population.In recent times, Hurricane Katrine struck the US in August 2005 and caused over £100billion worth of damage and killed at least 1,200 people.In September 2018, Hurricane Florence left at least 17 people dead after making landfall on the east coast of the US, devastating North Carolina, bringing with it biblical floodingAuthorities ordered the immediate evacuation of up to 7,500 people living within a mile of a stretch of the Cape Fear River and the Little River, about 100 miles from the North Carolina coast.The evacuation zone included part of the city of Fayetteville which has a population of 200,000.Reliable records of hurricanes began being kept in 1851 and since then there have been 905 storms of at least hurricane intensity.The intensity of a hurricane is determined either by its winds speed or its lowest barometric pressure.Hurricane Patricia is the most powerful hurricane ever recorded in the western hemisphere, hitting the Pacic coast of Mexico with winds of 202mph.Hurricane Allen holds the for the highest wind speed recorded in the Gulf of Mexico with 190mph.When it comes to intensity, Hurricane Wilma in 2005 holds the record for the lowest barometric pressure.The Saffir-Simpson scale has five categories of hurricane ranging from Category 1 with speeds of 74-95mp to Category 5 with speeds of 157 mph or above.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That solved the problem.The number of twins on Alabat may even have gone up in the last few years.In 2013, Transterra Media reported around 60 of them on the island.At the time, the mayor said four per cent of the islands 12,039 residents were twins.He and his we were shocked to find so many on the island when they migrated there in the 1980s.A historic study found a 182 per cent increase in multiple pregnancies in 35-year-old women between 1996 to 2006 due to the use of fertility drugs.But this could not have influenced Alabat, a remote island which did not have access to the medication.No scientic studies have been carried out to find out why there is such a high ratio of twins on the island."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000420437953.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"karren brady column alcohol vanity good health","story":"One day, butter is the enemy. The next it’s sugar. Then carbs. A few weeks later, sugar is back on the naughty step.It’s the same with alcohol. Until recently, a glass of wine a day kept heart attacks at bay. Last month, we learned that NO amount of alcohol is safe. Then this week our new goal, apparently, should be two teetotal days a week.It’s hard to keep up — and no wonder many people ignore all the reports. Who wants to be told what to do by a bunch of scientists who can’t make up their mind?But the latest news from Public Health England should give us all pause for thought, because British women now have some of the lowest le expectancies in Europe.Girls born in the UK today can expect to die three-and-a-half years earlier than girls in Spain, the country that comes out top in this report. The reasons? Rising levels of obesity and poor cancer survival rates.British women also fare badly when it comes to premature deaths — defined as before 75.Many are caused by cancer, heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, which are linked to smoking, alcohol and junk food.France, home of Michelin star chefs, is also way down on the list. And so is Italy.My supporting evidence is that I live with an Italian, who would be more likely to attend a funeral in a jester’s hat than eat a bag of crisps.Clearly, we all need to take a leaf out of the same book.The prevailing wisdom is that it’s more expensive to eat healthily. But that’s not true.A recent report from the Institute of Economic Affairs shows it’s possible to have your five-a-day for less than 30p — and a nutritious,  plain, diet can be bought for less than £1 a day.Meanwhile, the cheapest adult meal in McDonald’s is about £4.50, for which you could make a fresh vegetable curry for the whole family.So it’s not about money. Why, then, do us British women fare so badly?I wonder  we are so daunted by images of women airbrushed to perfection, in adverts and on social media, we feel we can’t compete. So we give up, eating what we like and not exercising.Because keeping really fit takes serious work.The latest insight into this is from movie star Mark Wahlberg who shared his daily schedule this week.He’s in bed by 7.30pm then up at 2.30am for the first of his two daily workouts. His fitness schedule only allows for two hours’ “work” a day — and thus it becomes clear his job is, in fact, his physique.Since most of us spend at least ten hours a day working and commuting, you can see why it’s often easier not to bother.But it’s not just our health that’s in peril. It’s also that of our children, for whom we are the primary role models.Not about vanity, but good healthI have evidence in the form of my best friend, who is a marathon-running exercise junkie — as is her daughter.I, on the other hand, although not proud of this fact, do no exercise — and my daughter doesn’t enjoy it as much as her friends.Getting fit and losing weight can feel impossible.But look at Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who this week announced that he has lost 7st and put his Type 2 diabetes in remission, which is pretty inspiring.So let’s choose to make this bad news story into a positive and use it as inspiration for change.Let’s aim for two booze-free days a week.And maybe ditch the biscuits for a bit and make some other small, sustainable changes that will leave us able to go for a brisk walk without fearing a heart attack.This is not about vanity, it’s about good health. Because the alternative is sobering.When it started off 18 years ago it was innovative and exciting TV. But now it’s degenerated into a hotbed of fame-hungry wannabes pitted against each other and behaving horribly as a result.Now it’s been axed. About time, too.I BELIEVE in people’s right to protest – of course – against political views they disagree with. But, Ian Bone, the protestor who assailed Jacob Rees-Mogg and his children on their own doorstep has crossed a line.“Your daddy is a horrible man,” Mr Bone told Mr Rees-Mogg’s bewildered-looking children, who will likely be traumatised by the incident – and will certainly not forget.MPs are already putting a lot on the line to serve their country. Many endure threats of violence or even death – and just look at what happened to Jo Cox.Yes, it’s fine to disagree with politicians and to protest. But taking it out on children and trying to make them feel bad about their father is bullying behaviour that is wholly unacceptable.Speaking to LBC afterwards, Mr Bone, who is 71, said that he saw no problem with involving children in his protest.But despite being happy to bring Mr Rees-Mogg’s offspring into the argument, he refused to speak about his own five children, and repeatedly refused to answer  he would have been happy for them to be treated in the same way.Talk about hypocritical.EVERYONE praised as progress the BBC’s “solution” to the inequality on comedy panel shows, which has been to ensure there is at least one woman on every show.But then we hear from Sandi Toksvig that their contributions are often edited out.The QI host told the Radio Times: “There are panel shows that struggle to get women on, and that’s because . . . in the edit they are often seen just laughing at the boys and not saying anything at all, even though I know for a fact in the recording they were clever.”Turns out that turning up and being funny isn’t quite enough,  you are a woman, to be given the same air time as men.

And what a great role model she is for women in their fties and beyond.WATCHING the video of a homeless man being sprayed with paint in Middlesbrough made my blood boil.The poor man – who was found dead just days later in a cemetery – is filmed sat against a wall, covered in paint, as a man brags: “This is how we dealwith the beggars on the street.”This disregard for another human being’s dignity is obscene and the yob should be made to volunteer helping homeless people.Until he sees that dehumanising this man who had hit troubled times was the lowest of the low.DID you see Madonna’s daughter, 21-year old Lourdes hitting the runway for the Gypsy Sport Spring Summer 2019 showcase at New York Fashion Week?It’s so dispiriting, isn’t it, that the headline news about her appearance, which could have focused on so many dferent things – her incredible confidence, for one – was that . . . she hadn’t shaved her legs, top.I guess true equality will have been achieved when a woman’s hairy calves go unmentioned and are seen as neither here nor there.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is no legal obligation to pay anything at all.This has been established by the House of Lords and no credible authority has questioned their Lordships.If we pay £40billon we must get something clear in , not just wishy-washy promises.Taxpayers would be outraged  it were otherwise.Any agreement on immigration must be examined with great care.We will doubtless be told that free movement has ended but, as Shakespeare wrote, “what’s in a name? that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet”.There ought to be no preferential terms for new arrivals from the EU above those offered to other nations and no access to state benefits.There must be a clear dferentiation in their rights after we have left and admission must be subject to a work permit scheme focused on skilled rather than unskilled labour.The solution to the Irish question is a further area where Brexiteers must be alert. Last week the European Research Group, which I chair, produced a paper explaining how it could be answered on the EU’s terms.Obviously the UK could simply say that there will be no physical infrastructure at the border but  instead we examine what the EU does on its other borders, and see  those precedents could be followed, then no reasonable person would think a “hard” border were necessary.So far the inevitable attacks on our reports have been mere rudery. No one has found fault with facts.If Ireland were used to justy the major concessions the Government is giving then we would know the deal is a bad one based on a false premise.It would be better than any other which the EU has so far agreed but Ireland is supposed to make it impossible.The issue has been used by those who are fearful of leaving the EU to keep us bound by its rules and regulations.Inevitably these complex machinations have led to some gossip about the leadership.These stories come from all wings of the Party with pro-Europeans such as Tom Tugendhat and George Freeman suggesting it is time to move to a new generationHowever, it is worth remembering the Prime Minister’s virtues.She is determined, thorough and dutul, and in my view duty is an heroic virtue.This gives her great strength and without a clear Parliamentary majority it is not obvious that anyone else could steer the negations to a conclusion.Pitt the Younger was hailed as the pilot who weathered the storm.

Nobody wants it.But this self-described “bloody dficult woman” believes she alone can ram it through.Either she knows something nobody else does . . . or her fabled “polished turd” is about to hit the fan.On tonight’s BBC’s Panorama, Mrs May spells out the formula she thinks propelled her to the top: “You bide your time and you are bloody dficult when it really matters.”Others fear a dferent characteristic has defined her political career, especially as Home Secretary.“She is mulishly stubborn,” says a former ally.“Once she digs her heels in, nothing can sht her — right or wrong.”They fear she will stick defiantly to her half-baked plan until she runs out of road and is forced to choose between an EU fudge or defeat in the House of Commons.The Chequers deal is flawed by the fantasy we can follow an EU rule book on free trade and regulation while reserving the right to duck and e.Outside Cabinet, Tories on all sides — Brexiteers and Remainers — insist it is unworkable.“It fails to take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade,” writes ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith.“We would be out of Europe yet still run by Europe.”EU negotiator Michel Barnier fears it endangers the whole EU project, which is already threatened by tensions over mass immigration, the Euro and jobless school leavers.Special treatment for the UK would instantly trigger demands from other member states for their own tailor-made deals, unravelling the drive for ever-closer union.Mrs May claims there is no alternative to Chequers.But there has to be — and Britain is already working on it.Despite Chancellor Phil Hammond’s blundering interference, preparations for a clean break are in train, covering everything from free trade to the vexed border with Northern Ireland.It may be pitched as a last-ditch option, only to be deployed in an emergency.But since Chequers is universally seen as a non-starter, free trade automatically becomes the only viable plan on the UK table.New Brexit minister, karate black belt and rising star Dominic Raab, is making this vividly clear in Brussels.He alarmed Downing Street by threatening to withhold the EU’s £40billion ransom  they push us too far.And he has told Barnier to do his own dirty work and impose a border in the Irish Sea  he dares.This is music to the ears of Tory MPs who desperately yearn to see some fighting spirit.They hope against hope Mrs May secretly has a cunning plan, ready to roll out at the right moment as she suggests, calling Barnier’s bluff.But there is another red card on the table, face up and flashing danger to our EU neighbours.Do they want to humiliate the PM to the point where she is defeated in Parliament and pushed into a second catastrophic election?EU leaders can read the polls which put Labour in front.They will also be horried to see ex-Tory vice-chairman Jeffrey Archer unhelpfully saying he would vote for Corbyn  he were a Northerner.And we should all be alarmed by David Cameron’s Goldman Sachs-trained Treasury minister, Jim O’Neill, saying: “I find myself struggling to be that scared by the prospect of a Corbyn government.”The EC has enough on its plate with the growing explosion of anti-Brussels populism across Europe. The last thing it wants any time soon is a hard-left Labour government led by lelong EU-haters Jeremy Corbyn and Marxist Chancellor John McDonnell.It might be the one bargaining chip that makes Michel Barnier blink first.For a Bank of England governor, his forecast of a 35 per cent crash in house prices verged on the hysterical.Project Fear has lost the power to shock, but it won’t stop trying.Aircraft will not fall from the sky, the Channel Tunnel will stay open, NHS patients will not starve or die from lack of NHS drugs.Not only have Carney’s nightmare scenarios of slump and mass unemployment proved false, the reverse has happened.Young workers are flocking to the UK for jobs. Wages are rising. Growth is strong.Now we see French companies such as Chanel stampeding to invest billions here.

And the influx continues.Latest statistics show the number of migrants who settled here in the year to March 2018 was 614,000, equal to a city bigger than Bristol. Net migration was around 270,000.Yet the revolution has been imposed by the ruling elite without any consent. No British citizen was ever asked to vote for this upheaval. No major party ever sought a mandate to open our doors.This helps to explain why the British public has such profound distrust in MPs on the question of immigration, as revealed in a major new opinion survey published this week.In the biggest consultation of its kind, involving 20,000 interviews, just one in six people showed any faith in the Government to tackle migration, while only 13 per cent felt that politicians are “open and honest” about the issue.These findings are not the result of bigotry or prejudice. Britons have been remarkably tolerant in the face of change.Indeed, that shines through the survey, which discovered that 65 per cent of people believe migrants bring valuable skills to the economy and the public sector. Similarly, 59 per cent think that ersity benefits our national culture.But British decency has been exploited by the political class to implement its agenda, with the result that disillusion is now widespread.People are rightly fed up with politicians who indulge in denial and deceit about the reality of mass immigration.A classic example was the phoney claim from the last Labour Government that, when the former communist countries of eastern Europe joined the EU in 2004, just 13,000 of their citizens would come to the UK. In fact, more than a million did.Even worse has been the attempt, particularly by the Left, to suppress open discussion by hurling accusations of racism against critics of mass immigration.A climate of censorship now prevails where public figures are expected to parrot the fashionable orthodoxy, and ordinary citizens are afraid to voice their concerns.Yet the anxieties of the public are all too genuine. Immigration has imposed more strain on our civic infrastructure, reflected in the shortage of affordable housing, the never-ending NHS crisis, the growth in the welfare burden and dficulties for parents in finding school places for kids.The import of cheap foreign labour has meant lower wages and job insecurity. Just as disturbing is the erosion of solidarity because of this upheaval.Social cohesion cannot exist without real integration, as the public recognised in the survey.The majority of respondents, 88 per cent, agreed with the idea that “migrants should learn English” and 85 per cent believe that migrants “should share our values”.But the multicultural ideology, which has long been the creed of the state, works in the opposite direction.It encourages migrants to cling to the practices and languages of their native lands, fuelling ision. As does the institutionalised acceptance of sharia law, which arguably offers more protection to men than women, undermining the traditional concept that we are all equal before the law.The consequences of multi-culturalism are seen at their most corrosive in the failure by the state to tackle serious crimes perpetrated by ethnic minorities, such as the organised abuse of girls by mainly Asian gangs in places like Rotherham and Derby.More concerned to uphold the illusion of cultural ersity’s success than to protect victims of crime, the police and other authorities indulged in a cover-up. It was only exposure of the abuse by journalists that finally forced them to act.That mix of official dishonesty and paralysis only undermines our society. There is a lesson for us from Europe, where the political order is threatened by growing public anger over immigration.In 2010, German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that “this multi-cultural approach has failed.” But she did nothing to reverse the policy. Instead, she opened the door even wider, especially in 2015 when she allowed in more than a million migrants.The crime that followed has led to public outcry.Britain has always been renowned for its avoidance of extremism. But we will avoid the same fate only  the state adopts a new approach on immigration, including more political honesty, tighter border controls and an emphasis on British values.That is not racist. As the public knows, it is a recipe for greater harmony.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a “fantasy island unicorn model”.Triumphant Remoaners piled in. It proved Brexiteers were clueless, they chirped. And Downing Street then ­produced its convoluted alternative.Except the EU, in the form of Michel Barnier, now believes in the fantasy island unicorn model too. The trouble being it wants it used between Britain and Northern Ireland instead of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.And the DUP, whom Theresa May needs for her survival, won’t wear that. Nor should they, since it ides the UK.Funny though, isn’t it, how Brussels move the goalposts when it suits them? They have negotiated in bad faith all along.TOO many politicians are in denial about the soaring cost of the NHS and social care. So we applaud Health Secretary Matt Hancock’s imaginative plan to sort the latter.The new lelong insurance system he is considering, compulsory for all workers unless they take a risk and opt out, looks a practical idea to fund part or all of an OAP’s care costs.It would give them peace of mind that they wouldn’t have to spend their savings or the proceeds from their home.Maybe it will work. Maybe not. Regardless, it is to Mr Hancock’s credit that he is starting a grown-up conversation at last over future funding of health.For too long progress has been stymied by the Left using any change to the NHS as a political weapon.But the structure of a health service designed in 1948 now needs a radical rethink.It is time reality dawned.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I didn’t have any other way to contextualise them.But the shows creators rejected claims that they were a couple, describing them as best friends.A statement from the Sesame Workshop stated: They were created to teach preschoolers that people can be good friends with those who are very dferent from themselves.Even though they are identied as male characters and possess many human traits and characteristics , they remain puppets, and do not have a sexual orientation.Some fans didnt take the news that the duo were not romantically involved well with one saying it had broken his heart.Others pointed out that other Muppets do appear to have a sexual orientation highlighting the decades long love affair between Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog.After same-sex marriage was legalised in New York, fans of the show set up a petition asking the shows creators to have Bert and Ernie get married on screen, according to Pink News.The puppet pair also found themselves at the heart of a fierce debate about discrimination and religious beliefs in 2015.A baker in Northern Ireland refused to bake a cake advocating gay marriage with their faces on it.Saltzman told Queerty that he would tell people the duo were based on him and Glassman, adding: I was Ernie.I look more Bert-ish. And Arnie as a film editor —  you thought of Bert with a job in the world, wouldn’t that be perfect? Bert with his paperclips and organisation?And I was the jokester. So, it was the Bert and Ernie relationship, and I was already with Arnie when I came to Sesame Street.So I don’t think I’d know how else to write them, but as a loving couple. I wrote sketches... Arnie’s OCD would create friction with how chaotic I was. And that’s the Bert and Ernie dynamic.A version of this story appeared on news.au"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000318152647.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"699\" width=\"960","title":"mumsnet mums blast john mcdonnells patronising and evasive online web chat","story":"The Marxist shadow chancellor was torn apart by the formidable users of Mumsnet in a live chat, where he was blasted as patronising and evasive.He revealed his favourite biscuit was a rich tea, said he looked up to his mum for working at BHS, and tried to calm fears in the parenting community about transgender issues.But his attempts to sweet talk Britains mums went totally down the pan.One mum said afterwards: He was doing his Im really bland, honest schtick.

Chequers is about the future relationship. I’m putting on the table what we think is the right plan for the UK.”Mrs May also shut down any suggestions that the country could face a People’s Vote.She said: “My answer to the People’s Vote is that we’ve had the people’s vote, it was the referendum – and now we should deliver on it.“I’m confident that we can get a good deal and when people come to look at that as the final end point in these negotiations, I hope people will reflect on the fact that we did give a vote to the people.”Taking a swipe at her Tory Eurosceptic critics she said they have failed produce a detailed alternative to her plans.She said: “The plan that is on the table, the plan that delivers on the Brexit vote but also protects jobs and maintains the unity of the UK, is the Chequers plan. I haven’t seen another plan that delivers on all of those.”Foreign minister Simon Coveney said: “There’s a danger in my view when dficult choices and dficult negotiations need to happen, that decisions get pushed off into November into December. We can’t allow that”.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab warned EU leaders that it’s now the EU’s turn to compromise as the UK has already offered up signicant concessions in the Chequers blueprint.In an article carried by a series of European newspapers, Mr Raab said: ““We made compromises and we showed ambition — and we do need to see that matched on the EU side.“We have shown a lot of flexibility and we have been very pragmatic. So I think this is the moment to see that matched. The ball is a little bit in the other court now”.Mr Barnier confirmed that the EU was ready to come forward with an improved plan for the Irish border - first revealed by The Sun on Saturday.But the proposal - which would see the new customs border between Britain and Northern Ireland policed with invisible technology - has already been thrown out by No10.Speaking ahead of the Salzburg summit, Mr Barnier said: We are ready to improve this proposal. Work on the EU side is ongoing.We are clarying which goods arriving in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would need to be checked and where, when and by whom these checks could be performed, he said.We can also clary that most checks can take place away from the border at the company premises or in the markets. We need to de-dramatise the checks that are needed.A position at once grotesquely offensive, historically illiterate, grievously insulting and — more happily — a fantasy.How dare EU “diplomats” crassly equate the decision facing Theresa May this autumn with Britain standing alone against Nazi bombers? Do ours speak of the Germans or French like that? No.More to the point, Brussels should recall how Britain responded in 1940: with defiance . . . and victory.And Michel Barnier is dreaming  he thinks he can bind a future Government. If we want to elect one committed to severing EU ties further we will.Today, dismissive EU leaders will give Mrs May just ten minutes of their precious time. How can Remainers still defend this outfit? It’s run like the Mob.If and when Brussels finally springs its trap on the PM she must be able to change course instantly or walk away.Voters will be merciless , in panic, they are sold down the river.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If that is reduced it will become a bit harder.“But they could think about finding ways to raise the wages, improve the terms and conditions so that these jobs become more attractive to UK residents.”The MAC was commissioned by ex-Home Secretary Amber Rudd to give a gauge the economic benefits of EU migration – and help the government design a post-Brexit borders visa regime.The verdict split think tanks and experts on both the Remain and Leave side.The MAC said EU migrants on the whole had benefited the economy and dismissed claims the sky-high immigration had contributed to NHS waiting times or school place shortages.But it said there was a noticeable dference between the benefits to Britain from high skilled migrants and lower-skilled, manual workers.It found evidence that migration had dented wages for the poorest Brits by up to 5 per cent since 1997, pushed up unemployment and queues for council houses.A new post-Brexit regime should close the door on all EU migration for jobs below £30,000 a year with the exception of seasonal workers in agriculture.Instead the PM should remove all restrictions on skilled workers – and introduce a visa regime that allowed in as many qualied EU and non-EU workers as business can afford.It also suggested lowering the ‘skills threshold’ to include tradesmen such as plumbers and electricians.Business would have to pay a skills charge of as much as £1,000 for every recruit per year.Migration Watch Lord Green said the MAC appeared to have been “blind to the impact of high levels of EU immigration on many communities in this country”.He stormed: “These proposals would permit continued high levels of immigration, including those with medium skills from all over the world.“The overall outcome would be to weaken immigration control rather than strengthen it.”The Resolution Foundation said that with EU migrants making up 30 per cent of the workforce in food manufacturing and one in five hotel staff, the MAC’s changes would represent “the biggest change to the UK labour market in a generation”.FISH and chip shop owners could be viewed as “skilled” in the shake-up proposed by the Migration Advisory Committee.It said Theresa May should lower the skills threshold after Brexit to include a wider range of professions. It could also cover pig breeders, amusement arcade managers and hairdressers.Employers would still have to pay at least £30,000 a year.Migration Watch chair Lord Green said: “If these professions could be eligible for a work permit, the numbers could simply rocket.”The British Chambers of Commerce stormed: “The MAC gives with one hand and takes away with the other, and the recommendations are unlikely to meet the needs of all employers.“Any sudden cut-off of EEA skills and labour would be concerning,  not disastrous for firms across a wide range of regions and sectors.”Home Secretary Sajid Javid tweeted: “Our future immigration system needs to be based on evidence.“Today’s Migration Advisory Committee report helps.“I will closely consider it as we take back control. My thanks to the MAC for their hard work.”THERESA May was told yesterday there should be no preferential treatment for EU citizens in a post-Brexit immigration system.The Migration Advisory Committee said the Government should “discriminate on skills” rather than where a worker is from once free movement rules end.But the MAC said the Government could allow Brussels better terms to seal a new trade deal.It said the benefits for EU migrants working in Britain meant a concession could be a card for the PM to play.THE big migration report looks mainly like common sense.We have long argued that free movement must end and a new post-Brexit immigration policy be designed to suit our economy, not arbitrary limits.So we SHOULD increase skilled workers from around the world and stem the low-skilled. Building firms will have to recruit more Brits and raise pay.And, yes, we must ditch the pro-EU policy that favours its labourers over talented Indian doctors.Where we doubt the Migration Advisory Committee is its claim over the negligible impact of mass migration.Our population has soared by seven million since 2001, mostly via immigration. Schools, hospitals and homes have been built nowhere near fast enough.How can that not have had graver consequences? A few communities have been overwhelmed. Many workers have SEEN it hold down their pay.If the effect has been so tiny, why does the MAC recommend any action at all?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

How to his claims stand up to scrutiny?\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt\u0027s no secret that immigration - and fears about it - fuelled the vote for Brexit. But today an expert report makes extremely awkward reading for some of Leave\u0027s biggest champions, including ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage. The Migration Advisory Committee concluded there should NOT be preferential treatment for EU migrants after 2020 compared to those from the rest of the world. And it said low-skilled workers should be limited, while higher-skilled ones should be encouraged. But while this may look like a Brexiteers\u0027 boon, it\u0027s not all one sided at all. The report also picked apart a string of the most pervasive myths behind the Leave vote. We\u0027ve highlighted some of the more illuminating passages - and compared them to quotes they directly contradict by one Mr Nigel Farage. If only we had this in 2016, eh?  What Nigel Farage said: We must be completely mad, as a country, to be giving people from Eastern Europe in-work benefits... Even  I thought, which I don\u0027t, there was an economic benefit to mass immigration some things are more important than money, namely the shape of our society and giving our own youngsters a chance to work.  What today\u0027s report says: The average adult migrant from the European Economic Area  contributed approximately \u0026pound2,300 more to the UK public finances than the average adult resident in the UK. The average non-EEA migrant contributed around \u0026pound840 less than the average adult resident in the UK. Far from being a drain on resources the MAC found that European migrants - especially those from EU13 which makes up older members of the bloc - pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits and use in public services. It\u0027s only non-EU migrants, who are already subject to visa controls, who on average contribute less than native Brits.   What Nigel Farage said:  The problem we’ve got is a population crisis caused by government policy on immigration. The problem is we haven’t got enough hospitals, we haven’t got enough doctors, we haven’t got enough facilities... Right now it’s pretty much at breaking point.  What today\u0027s report says: EEA migrants contribute much more to the health service and the provision of social care in financial resources and through work than they consume in services. EEA workers are an increasing share of the health and social care workforces though these sectors employ greater numbers of non-EEA migrants. There is no evidence that migration has reduced the quality of healthcare. 3. Migrants have had little impact on jobs for British citizens...   What Nigel Farage said: I would rather we had communities that were rather more united and we had a situation where young unemployed British people had a realistic chance of getting a job.  What today\u0027s report says:  In this report we assessed the impact of migration on the labour market, including on employment and wages. Taking all the new evidence into account we found that migrants have no or little impact on the overall employment and unemployment outcomes of the UK-born workforce. The impact may y across dferent UK-born groups with more negative effects for the lower-skilled and more positive effects for the higher-skilled. However, our robustness checks suggest that these findings are subject to uncertainty.   What Nigel Farage said: There is no question that [immigration] has pushed wage inflation down it’s helped big companies and big corporations and big landowners to make bigger profits - no argument about that.  What today\u0027s report says: In terms of wages the existing evidence and the analysis we present in the report suggests that migration is not a major determinate of the wages of UK-born workers. We found some evidence suggesting that lower-skilled workers face a negative impact while higher-skilled workers benefit, however the magnitude of the impacts are generally small. 5.

Sara Thornton said they will be forced to fall back on slower, more bureaucratic systems, making the country more vulnerable to the dangers of terrorism, organised crime and foreign offenders. If the country crashes out of the EU in March, police operations like the major investigation into the Novichok poisoning will be affected. Mr Thornton, chairwoman of the National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council, said: The fallbacks we\u0027re going to have to use will be slower, will be more bureaucratic and it will make it harder for us to protect UK citizens and make it harder to protect EU citizens. We are determined to do everything we can to mitigate that, but it will be hard. She said it will take ten times longer for British police to check  a foreign suspect had convictions in their home country, up from six to 66 days. European Arrest Warrants have been issued for the two Russian GRU agents suspected of the Salisbury poisoning, meaning that  they enter Europe they should be arrested.  But UK law enforcement would lose access to the power  no deal is secured, and police would be forced to negotiate inidually with each country. Ms Thornton went on: A very current example would be the two GRU officers who were responsible for the Novichok attack. If they are to step out of Russia into Europe there are European Arrest Warrants waiting for them. If we lose the European Arrest Warrant on March 29 because there was no deal, no agreement, then we have to rely on the 1957 convention and it\u0027s longer, more complicated extradition process and they don\u0027t always apply in all countries. Ms Thornton spoke as plans were unveiled for a new unit that will oversee how forces use alternative systems in the event of a no-deal Brexit. There are 40 tools that UK law enforcement may lose access to, including the EAW and the Schengen Information System, an intelligence database that was accessed 539 million times by British authorities last year alone.

Speaking at the climax of the four-day event in Brighton, he said Brexit would be Brexiteers\u0027 ‘erotic spasm’. At least he tried to. But when the big moment arrived he failed to deliver - and called it an exotic spresm. You might say it was an anticlimax. Or he c**ked it up. Or when it came to the big moment he couldn\u0027t perform. You get the picture. So apart from that obvious and fantastic highlight, what did the Lib Dem leader actually say? Here are the five most important things we learned from Vince Cable’s speech to Lib Dem conference 2018.  Announcing a crackdown on greedy housebuilders, tax dodgers and Amazon, it\u0027s clear who the Lib Dem leader sees as his competition. Just a year after calling for more grown-up politics, Vince Cable launched a vicious attack on Jeremy Corbyn , saying he should wave goodbye  he does not back a second referendum on Brexit . He used to be the campaigning backbencher who joined us in opposing the Iraq War and defending civil liberties, he said. In his new role he has kept his hands clean and his image polished by hiring hard left bootboys and girls to do his dirty work. They do the bullying and the intimidation of colleagues and he claims not to know. He indulges anti-Semitic bigots and pleads ignorance.  Sir Vince accused Mr Corbyn\u0027s inner circle of until recently being on the Stalinist wing of the microscopic British Communist Party with policies more relevant to the steam age than to the digital age. Quoting a Tory attack line, he declared: We do not believe in magic money trees and pots of gold at the end of the rainbow. And comparing both Labour and Tories to a cult, he added: The tectonic plates of British politics are shting beneath us. The two big parties have changed from broad churches into intolerant cults. And those who question the faith are unwelcome. The Labour leadership is dominated by people who believe in doctrines far removed from the sensible social democratic tradition which prevailed from the days of Clement Atlee to Gordon Brown. They in turn are the mirror image of the Tory zealots who have more in common with UKIP than their party’s one-nation traditions. People of moderate, decent, humane views are being marginalised as this new Illiberal International takes shape. 2. He declared war on Amazon  Vince Cable demanded a fresh war against “world class tax-dodgers” like Amazon, Facebook and Google in a bid to revive high streets. The Lib Dem leader vowed to spearhead “a renewed offensive” on corporate tax avoidance, which he warned was ruining traditional shops and stores. He also called for HM Revenue and Customs to publish tax reports of firms operating in Britain as a way of persuading companies to cough up. Addressing activists at Lib Dems\u0027 Brighton conference, Sir Vince said: “Every citizen and company should pay their fair share and get something for what they put in. “Nothing gets up the noses of honest taxpayers more than a government squeezing every penny it can out of small firms while rolling out the red carpet for world-class tax-dodgers like Amazon, Facebook and Google. “To that end we want a renewed offensive against inidual and corporate tax-dodging.  “In addition, we will scrap outdated business rates, which are destroying our high streets, and reform company taxation for the digital age.” Web firms have been accused of shting money around the world to minimise taxes. They insist they pay all cash due in every country. Today\u0027s speech also declared war on housebuilders. The Lib Dem leader said: Big housing developers like Barratts, Berkeley Homes, and Persimmon are mainly land speculation machines with a side line in house building. Elsewhere he repeated plans to scrap inheritance tax and replace it with a levy on large financial gts received over someone\u0027s letime. Under separate plans the Lib Dems would also tax capital gains from assets at the same rate as income from employment - up to 45% - and raise taxes overall. Lastly pension tax relief would be rebalanced away from the highest earners towards those least able to save. 3. He warned of riots after Brexit  In a move that surprises literally no one, Sir Vince is making a big push for a second referendum on Brexit. It really beggars belief that the army and the police are now being asked to prepare for riots in the chaotic aftermath of a botched Brexit, he said. And billions – billions – of taxpayers’ money spent preparing for disaster. He claimed the Lib Dems have gained 10,000 members in 10 days as the party campaigns against a costly and painful exit. In a quote that risks accusations he is insulting voters\u0027 intelligence, he said: Brexit still appeals to many hearts,  not to many minds. And he said people had suffered a move from skilled and respected jobs to crap jobs - from certainty to insecurity. 4. He revealed his family chucked him out for having a mixed-race marriage  The 75-year-old spoke movingly about his own experience of racism, during his marriage to first we, Olympia, a nurse originally from Goa. The Lib Dem leader told the hall his parents threw him out of their home over the marriage. “I embarked on a mixed marriage in this country when racism was re,” he said. He told the hall his we and three children were “being denounced as people whose very presence here would lead to rivers foaming with blood. “And I was thrown out of the parental home. “So I will never waver in my commitment to call out and stand up to racism in all its forms.” “But,” he added. “We must understand that to dismiss all Brexit voters as racists is simply wrong and utterly counterproductive.” Sir Vince also refused to accept the idea that wanting immigration to be managed “like other parts of the economy” was racist. 5.

But it wasn’t an everyday family scene as  they were heading home after a late party. Heartbreakingly Clare was cradling Olivia’s leless body just hours after she died at home, weeks before her sixth birthday – nearly a year after being diagnosed with a rare, aggressive brain tumour. Each second seemed on freeze frame as they drove Olivia to a hospice to give a most precious gt – their precious daughter\u0027s brain and spine for research into the tumour that killed her – a Dfuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma .  “My heart was shattered Olivia was dead but I loved being able to cuddle her again,” said Clare Gregory from Wickford, Essex. “I hadn’t been able to do that for two months as she’d been so ill she didn\u0027t want anyone touching her. “I cradled her like a new-born baby as Tony drove with our other daughter, Eva, beside him.” At Little Havens Hospice, she gently carried Olivia into the bereavement room, with twinkling fairy lights and Disney songs softly playing in the background. “It was so peaceful and quiet,” said Clare.  “We tucked Olivia up in bed and she looked like she was just asleep – our little Sleeping Beauty.” Olivia was in a special chilled bed so they were able to spend some more time with her. Then she was taken to Great Ormond Street Hospital  in London for the brain donation to its INSTINCT programme, co-funded by The Brain Tumour Charity . Now Clare wants to “shatter the taboo” of talking about donating brains for research in the hope of one day saving other families their heartache. A video of her and another parent talking about their daughters’ brain donations will be shown at The Brain Tumour Charity’s Nurses and Allied Health Professional Conference tomorrow .  The video aims to encourage more health professionals to make patients and parents aware that brain donation is an option. The family’s nightmare started in early 2017 when Olivia became increasingly tired. “From being a normal, lively little girl all she wanted to do was lie down,” said Clare who works for an investment bank. “She’d come home from school and flake out on the settee and, at bed time, she was out like a light.” During the May half-term, the family went on holiday to Great Yarmouth. “Instead of running around, Olivia would say ‘Daddy, you’ll have to carry me’ “She’d also been waking up on and off with headaches and nausea. “And she was always falling over.” Clare took Olivia to the GP twice and was told it was a virus and adenoid problems. “But I just knew something was dreadfully wrong,” she said. On June 1 2017, Olivia woke up in the middle of the night vomiting. Clare took her to A \u0026amp E at their local hospital where she was again told Olivia had a virus and sent home with Calpol and Diorlyte. Two days later, Olivia kept losing her balance and was lethargic. Clare took her to a private GP and got an appointment with a consultant paediatrician the next day. Back at home, Clare found found The Brain Tumour Charity’s HeadSmart campaign, online, which raises awareness about children’s symptoms.  Ticking off Olivia’s symptoms one by one, Clare felt sick. “I said to my mother-in-law, ‘I think the consultant is going to say Olivia has a brain tumour.’” she recalls. “But when I told the consultant about my fears, he just said, ‘oh no, brain tumours are very rare.’ “I asked him why should Olivia be exempt? Why shouldn’t she have a brain tumour?” Two days later, Olivia was worse and the weight was dropping off her. “I told Tony I was going to take to her to A \u0026amp E in the morning and that I wouldn’t leave until they gave her a scan,” said Clare. “At hospital, a nurse said she believed me when I told her I thought Olivia had a brain tumour. “She trusted my instinct and that I knew my child.” Olivia had an MRI scan and they had to wait hours for the results. “We had the long walk to the relatives’ room where doctors told us they’d found a ‘mass’ on Olivia’s brain,” said Clare. “I just replied ‘I know’ as Tony sat in shock.” The next day, Olivia had emergency surgery to put a shunt in her brain as she had hydrocephalus – fluid on the brain.  Surgeons took a biopsy which revealed she had an inoperable DIPG, which only affects around 40 children a year with a prognosis of 9-12 months. “The strange thing was that I’d never been able to imagine Olivia growing up,” said Clare. “Whether that was mother’s instinct, a premonition or coping mechanism, I don’t know. “But I just couldn’t see her in my mind as an older child.” Clare instantly accepted Olivia was going to die. “I had no choice, but what I couldn’t bear was the thought of her suffering,” she said. But it still came as a shock when doctors said that Olivia had 9-12 months to live. “I heard this gasp and realised it was me,” said Clare. During the summer holidays, Olivia had six weeks of radiotherapy and also started The Brain Tumour Charity-funded Biomede trial , the UK’s first adaptive trial for children with high-grade  brain tumours. She had few side-effects but her steroids made her put on weight and suffer mood swings. Determined to make the most of every second, the family banked happy memories, including a trip to Lapland UK, holiday in Marrakech, a simulated Tube drive, swimming with the dolphins in Dubai and EuroDisney. “We just did our best to carry on – we had Eva to think about, too,” said Clare. “Despite everything, there was still plenty of laughter – Olivia had a wicked sense of humour and loved lip-synching to her favourite group Little Mix’s songs. “And she and Eva were so funny together.”  Four months after Olivia’s diagnosis, Clare met another mum through a Facebook DIPG support group, who told her how her adult daughter had donated her brain. “It was a light bulb moment,” said Clare. “Tony and I met up with her and her husband. There was none of that head-tilted sympathy – they got it. “I was already 99.9 per cent sure I wanted to donate Olivia’s brain but meeting them confirmed my decision. “Talking to them calmed Tony’s fears about what would happen and how she would look afterwards.” Clare saw it as a way for Olivia to “leave her footstep on the world.” “I knew Olivia would never grow up or have a job, so I decided donating her brain for research would be her job,” she said. Clare got in touch with her local brain bank. “It was straight forward – I filled in some forms and put them away,” said Clare. “You didn’t have to sign them until after your child died, so you could change your mind.” They talked about it in code at home as “the gt.” By February, Olivia was weaker down her right side and had slurred speech. “It was coming up to nine months after diagnosis - it always felt like the clock ticking,” said Clare. Olivia’s MRI scan on March 22 revealed her tumour was growing again. She was now in the final stages of her le. Over the next few months, Olivia spent more and more time sleeping. “Olivia wanted to be at home with us so we set up a hospital bed in our lounge,” said Clare. “For five weeks, she couldn’t speak or swallow. It was horric.” June 5 2018 is a date which will be etched in their hearts forever. “Olivia was on morphine and I will never forget the dreadful sound of her breathing,” said Clare.  “Tony or I were always at her side and she just wanted to hold our hands all the time.” Clare rang her palliative care doctor for advice about Olivia’s pain relief. “While I was on the phone, she was holding Tony’s hand and just turned her head towards me,” said Clare. “Suddenly the awful noise stopped – she’d stopped breathing. “I kept saying ‘oh my god, oh my god, it’s over, it’s over’ down the phone. “The relief she wasn’t suffering any more was unbelievable. “She looked so peaceful.” Before they woke Eva up, the couple had time with Olivia to say their goodbyes. “We wanted – needed - that time –a bit like that precious time alone after giving birth,” said Clare. “I told Olivia, ‘I’m so sorry Mummy couldn’t fix this and save you.’” Tony’s parents who live nearby came to see Olivia and they woke Eva to tell her Olivia had died. “We all took it in turns to kiss her and say our goodbyes,” said Clare. They drove her to hospital themselves instead of ringing an ambulance as they wanted to be alone with her and had a letter saying they were taking Olivia for brain donation. After they spent some time with Olivia at the hospice, she was taken to GOSH for the brain donation. She was then taken back to the hospice in a pink coffin her big sister had chosen until her funeral a week later. “There were no scars or signs Olivia had donated her brain, except for a small mark under her hairline,” said Clare.  “She looked perfect. “I just wanted the cancer out of her – so that she was pure for her funeral and her ashes are pure.” Now Clare is sharing her story to help The Brain Tumour Charity raise awareness about how vital brain donation is for research. “We don’t call it a donation – we call it a gt – as it’s the greatest gt a parent can give,” said Clare. “Gting Olivia’s brain is a huge comfort as she is still leaving her trace on the world. “No one once asked me or even mentioned it was a possibility and I totally understand it’s not for every family, but I hope sharing my story gives more health professionals the confidence to ask the question. “It’s too late for my daughter but donating her brain for research may help other children in the future. “It gives me a glimmer of hope.” Poignantly, one of the videos Clare treasures is from Christmas when Olivia and Eva, 11, used an angel filter. Smiling into the camera, adorned with halo and wings, Olivia says, “Look, I’m a  angel because I can fly!” “Watching it is so bitter sweet - now she really is our  angel looking over us all,” said Clare. “Not a day goes by that I don’t ache for Olivia but  we help to one day save just one family our heartache it’s worth it – and I think our little angel would be proud of us.” "},{"url":null,"title":"aldi launches hangover free prosecco","story":"NewsAldi launches \u0027hangover free\u0027 prosecco for just £7.99 - and we\u0027re very excitedThe supermarket has come up with a bottle of bubbly that has less hangover-causing sulphites in itShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAmy Coles21:21, 18 SEP 2018Updated21:38, 18 SEP 2018NewsProsecco is lovely, but it can cause some very bad headaches \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThere\u0027s only one downside to enjoying a few crisp, cool glasses of prosecco and that\u0027s the inevitable hangover. Depending on how much you\u0027ve drunk that could be in the form of a throbbing headache that keeps you bed bound all day. But what  you could enjoy prosecco to your heart\u0027s content, without the suffering the morning after? Aldi have come to the rescue with a \u0027hangover free\u0027 bottle of bubbly, part of its new line of organic wines. The \u0026pound7.99 bottle of organic prosecco is sourced from the Corvezzo family\u0027s 150-hectare estate, 30km north-east of Venice. The winery is also eco-friendly and committed to using renewable energy.  But the best bit is, its thought the drink won\u0027t leave you with a fuzzy head in the morning because it has fewer sulphite preservatives - the nasties that can help give you a hangover - meaning you should be less likely to be stuck nursing a hangover. And that\u0027s not all. The fruit for the prosecco is grown with “no pesticides or herbicides” – another factor thought to lessen the chances of a hangover. Tweeting about its new organic range recently, the supermarket made a nod to the drink’s ‘hangover proof’ qualities, writing: We’re raising a glass this Organic September to our range of delicious, organic wine. Apparently, they’re hangover-proof… better have a glass to find out.

Katherine Lavin, 21, was given the warning after admitting supplying a controlled class A drug and possession of cannabis. An inquest had previously heard how Lavin bought \u0026pound7 bags of pure ecstasy known as MDMA for a group of friends including Joana Burns for a night out on June 6, last year. Joana had created two home-made \u0027MDMA bombs\u0027 by splitting the \u0026pound7 powder into two cigarette wrappers. But the Sheffield Hallam University Maths student became unwell at around 3.30am and started fitting after complaining she was too hot.  She later died in hospital. Lavin, 21, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to supplying a controlled drug of class A on June 6, 2017, and possession of cannabis at a previous hearing. Computer science student Benjamin Williams, 25, today also pleaded guilty to supplying a controlled drug of class A. Both were bailed and will appear at Sheffield Crown Court on October 12 for sentencing. Addressing both defendants, Recorder of Sheffield judge Jeremy Richardson QC said: This matter is now ready for sentence.  Unfortunately, it\u0027s impossible for you to be sentenced today but you will be sentenced on the date in October. Please, read nothing into the fact that pre sentence reports are required and please read nothing into the fact you are being given bail. These are serious matters. All sentencing options remain open, that includes being sent to prison. At an inquest into the death of Joana in May, assistant coroner Abigail Combes recorded a conclusion of misadventure. Joana had attended Sheffield University\u0027s Student Union event night called Club Tuesdays on June 6, 2017. She had created two home-made \u0027MDMA bombs\u0027 by splitting the \u0026pound7 powder into two cigarette wrappers, Sheffield Coroner\u0027s Court heard. The Sheffield Hallam mathematics student was in a group of six who had all taken the same amount - knowing what to take \u0027following research on the internet\u0027. The group, which included Joana\u0027s boyfriend Lewis Birch, had been planning the night out for weeks and had all bought a \u0026pound7 bag each of MDMA - which amounted to a quarter of a gram.  The inquest hearing was told one member of the group, Lavin, had bought the \u0027brown-coloured substance\u0027 for everyone in preparation for the night out on June 6, 2017.

She is a woman not only out of her depth, has not only floundered for more than a decade, but has no idea where she\u0027s gone wrong. It\u0027s hard to see her without thinking of a fly batting itself against a window until it expires, able to see the fresh air but unable to find it. If she reads this - which she might, because she defines herself only by what others think of her - she\u0027ll assume I\u0027m a Left-wing liberal about to rail against her Right-wing freedom of speech. No, Katie. Someone who knows more than you is going to explain how the hatred has suffocated you. We both have epilepsy - mine very mild, hers very severe. The condition strikes in her sleep, led to her being expelled from Sandhurst, to break vertebrae and frequently dislocate her shoulders. She recently had brain surgery that ended the seizures but left her with a hole in her skull and needing to re-learn how to climb stairs. She blames the medication she has needed since young for the fact her oldest daughter is autistic and her youngest was born with a deformed hip that required many surgeries to correct. Those would be enough disability for most people to deal with. But Katie has an extra one - a mistaken belief that she\u0027s a journalist.  Let\u0027s not be precious about the Street of Shame. It is a trade, not a profession, and the only qualication necessary is a level of enthusiasm bordering on mental illness. But somewhere along the line most journalists get training. They get it from a practical degree, a vocational course, or at worst from paying attention to people who\u0027re doing it already. Katie became a journalist because first she became a media star, and she managed THAT with what she called being outspoken and everyone else called being a right cow. On The Apprentice in 2006 she hogged the camera by making amusingly-nasty remarks about maternity leave, fat people, and fellow contestants. She resigned at the end of the penultimate show citing childcare concerns, which others mocked because she had known what she was getting into. But it\u0027s perhaps worth noting both that her concerns were for two disabled daughters, and also that she was mocked mainly because she\u0027d been so happy to mock others.  Katie sold her story for six-figure sums, had celebrity spats, and was pictured in flagrante in a field with someone else\u0027s husband. She got a regular column in her local paper the Exeter Express \u0026amp Echo , but it ended after an online poll found 84% of the readers wanted her fired. It was a hint she did not take. She was invited onto TV as a guarantee of ratings. Three years ago Buzzfeed reported a former staffer at This Morning said she was always willing to cause controversy from the word go. Such programmes involve a chat with a producer in advance, and Katie would immediately come up with a firm line on something, and then wheeled on-air to spout it with little thought from either her or producers about where it would end. So in 2013 when she told Philip and Holly she wouldn\u0027t let her children play with someone called Tyler or Chardonnay or named after geography, it was pointed out one of her children was called India and the clip went viral.  Katie learned to make money by being rude and unapologetic, and the media learned to shore up their audience figures with a wingnut. Inevitably, she was offered a national newspaper column, a place in the Big Brother house, and more opprobrium as the hate multiplied. In 2015 she used her column to denounce migrants as cockroaches, and it quietly disappeared before she popped up at another website which racked up \u0026pound150,000 damages plus costs for her groundless claim that a pair of Muslim brothers banned from travelling to Disneyland were linked to al Qaeda. She met holocaust deniers, tweeted about being with crew of a Save the Children ship she didn\u0027t board, and had repeated applications to join UKIP rejected. She made a habit out of getting it wrong. She moved on to LBC, left after calling for a final solution to Islamic terror, was questioned but not charged over alleged hate crimes, and more recently staged a picture with children at a school without their parents\u0027 or teachers\u0027 permission, a gross breach of journalistic ethics. She has her own website and, one hopes, has invested in some defamation legal insurance. Now she\u0027s been sued over a defamatory tweet, lost her home, and had to enter an agreement with her creditors. All of it is due to the simple fact that she attempted to be a journalist without any of the necessary skills.  If Katie had experience of working in the media before she became its favourite monster, she\u0027d have known that what you don\u0027t say is just as important as what you do. By all means say you\u0027re snobby about the name Charmaine, but it might be an idea to know Shakespeare was happy to use it for one of his characters. If you make a habit of racking up legal bills for your employer, be careful with what you publish on social media. If you are caught lying, stop doing it. Steer clear of people with swastikas in their Twitter handles and  you don\u0027t know what defamation is, look it up. But more than anything else the lesson that Katie needed to learn was this: that becoming a hate figure is a viable but short media career. She chose a path that was an ever-decreasing spiral of bile, and it was only ever going to lead her into peril. I\u0027m not sure she knows how she got there. She started out as entertainment, and ended up with the twin Pyrrhic victories of being praised by Donald Trump and winning an IPSO ruling against the Daily Mirror about the fact she was not detained for taking ketamine in South Africa, but for spreading racial hatred. Now she\u0027s broke and the only people still paying attention are creditors and knicker-snfing Nazis.  Katie was not a journalist but a controversialist - built and brought down by her ignorance of how journalism works. Her name is flung at others who make a much better fist of it, along with accusations they all want to be like her. Nothing could be further from the truth - journalists, above all things, want to be right. Katie was just a story, and it\u0027s a sad indictment of the media that it relied for attention on a sick woman spouting proto-fascist lies. But the principal blame is on Katie herself. She had enough clues, from as early as her first interview after leaving The Apprentice when Nick Hewer said her new brand had made you famous, but it\u0027s made you loathed. And where\u0027s it going to take you now? She never seems to have asked where it would lead. Even with training, she would never have made much of a journo. She has a thick skin and bloody-mindedness, but seems to lack empathy, accuracy, self-doubt or persuasiveness. She is a curiosity, but doesn\u0027t have any. The first rule of journalism is \u0027never become the story\u0027. Not just because it\u0027s professionally embarrassing, but because all copy finishes the same way - with the word \u0027ends\u0027. * Fleet Street Fox\u0027s new book, A Bluffer\u0027s Guide To Journalism, is published in March.

The video, released by police following the sentencing, shows Lowe stabbing the man in the middle of a crowded street.  Minutes before the attack, Lowe verbally abused a 24-year-old woman outside the Dog and Partridge pub in Nottingham before becoming involved in an altercation with the victim when he stuck up for her, Nottinghamshire Live reports.   A heated exchange took place between the two men, which can be seen in the video, before Lowe walked off, bought the kne, and stabbed his victim in the abdomen. The victim ran inside the pub followed by Lowe who was still brandishing the blade as customers watched on in horror - although he did not attack him again. Shortly afterwards he was tackled to the ground by two members of the public and pinned down until police arrived and arrested him. The victim was taken to hospital following the attack with non le-threatening injuries.  The OAP pleaded guilty to having an offensive weapon and intentionally inflicting grievous bodily harm on the 38-year-old man in Milton Street at a court hearing earlier this year. Today, he was sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court to eight years in prison. Detective Sergeant Andy Buxton, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: This was a calculated attack where Lowe has bought a kne with the sole intention of stabbing a man who he had an argument with.

The Duchess of Sussex cooked with women from the Hubb Community Kitchen, who were affected and collaborated with them to create the book, Together. Meghan grew close to the team at the kitchen in the Al Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre in west London. She also wrote an emotional three-page foreword for the book, recalling how she heard about the fire while working in Canada, and how she wanted to help. Here are three of the book\u0027s recipes..  Ingredients  1 potato, about 150g 3 tbsp vegetable oil, extra for brushing 1 tsp mustard seeds 1⁄4 tsp fenugreek seeds 1⁄2 tsp cumin seeds 1 onion, finely sliced 1⁄2 tsp ground turmeric 1⁄2 tsp ground cinnamon 120g white cabbage, finely sliced 1 large carrot, 120g, peeled and grated 100g mixed red and green peppers, cored, de-seeded and finely chopped 50g frozen peas 1⁄2 tsp granulated sugar 12 spring roll pastry wrappers, 25 x 25cm 1 egg, lightly beaten salt Method Boil the potato in salted water for 30 minutes until soft. Drain and leave to cool, then peel and dice. Heat the oil in a large frying pan on a medium heat. Add spice seeds and fry for 30 seconds, until fragrant. Add onion, salt and cook for 2 minutes. Add turmeric and cinnamon and stir for a few seconds until the onion is coated. Add the cabbage, carrot and peppers and cook over high heat for 4–5 minutes or until soft. Add the diced potato, peas, 1⁄2 teaspoon of salt and the sugar and stir for 2 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning  needed. Transfer to a large plate and leave to cool. Cut each pastry square in half to make two rectangles. Keep the pastry covered with a clean, damp tea towel to stop it drying out.  Working with one strip of pastry at a time and with a long edge facing you, fold the bottom right-hand corner of the strip to meet the top edge, forming a triangle, then fold the top right-hand corner over to meet the top left-hand corner of the strip, forming a square. Brush the single layer of pastry  with beaten egg and fold over to form a triangular pouch. Open the pouch and fill with 3 tbsp of the samosa filling. Brush wrap with beaten egg and fold over to seal the pouch. Place on a tray and cover while making the rest of the samosas. Preheat the oven to 200\u0026degC and put the samosas on a baking sheet lined with baking paper. Brush tops with a oil and beaten egg. Bake for 10 minutes, then turn them over, brush the other side with oil and egg and bake for another 10 minutes.

Rub one third of the paste over the chicken, into the cuts and under the skin reserve rest of the mixture. Refrigerate chicken for at least 1 hour, or up to 5 hours. Preheat grill to the highest setting, and line a large baking tin with foil. In a large pan, melt the coconut oil on a medium heat add the remaining paste and cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes or until all of the moisture evaporates. Increase the heat slightly and cook for 3–5 minutes until the paste is thick and dark. Add coconut milk and simmer for 25–30 minutes until sauce is thick. Meanwhile, put the marinated chicken, skin side up, in the lined baking tin and grill for 15 minutes, until well coloured and charred, then turn the chicken over and grill for another 5 minutes to make sure it is cooked through. Stir the chicken and any juices into the curry pan, bring to a simmer, cover and cook for 5 minutes until the flavours have combined. Taste and adjust the seasoning  necessary. Add the boiled eggs and the lemon juice to taste. Sprinkle with the chopped coriander and serve with rice, chapatis or flatatbreads.

Grease a 23cm round springform cake tin with the sunflower oil and place on a baking sheet. For the caramel, put 225g of the granulated sugar into a small, wide, heavy pan on a low heat. Without stirring, let the sugar dissolve. Once liquid, let it gently bubble for 15–20 minutes or until it is a deep golden colour. Add 10g of the butter, half the vanilla extract and the salt, gently swirling the pan to combine the butter as it melts. Once fully incorporated, immediately remove from the heat and pour the caramel into the cake tin. Place the plum halves on top, cut side down, nestled tightly together, and set aside. In a large mixing bowl, beat the remaining butter together with the remaining granulated and brown sugar until pale and creamy: this will take 2–3 minutes using a electric whisk  you don’t have one, use a wooden spoon.

But Domestos believes that a clean and safe toilet should be within everyone’s reach so it is helping to answer the public’s prayers. Its Use Our Loos campaign, launched earlier this month, is inviting businesses across Britain to sign up, open their cubicles and welcome everyone - customers and non-customers - to use their loos. And they’ve also agreed to feature on the Great British Public Toilet Map – a free interactive street map developed by Domestos and Public Convenience. The map - the UK’s largest database of publicly-accessible toilets - includes lavs that are located in local businesses as well as those at bus and train stations, shopping centres, libraries, leisure centres and hotels.  And it’s compiled using information from councils, the businesses themselves and YOU! As well as using the map to discover nearby loos, the public can help improve the service by adding new locations or flagging loos that have closed. Anyone can go on the website and add or edit the correct information about the toilet such as who can access it, opening hours, or facilities available. Just click on the Great British Toilet Map image below to reveal the map and find your nearest available toilet...   By visiting toiletmap.org.uk on a computer of smartphone, your device will automatically find your location and reveal your nearest available toilets. Users can also look for loos before leaving their home or office by typing in a postcode to search other areas.  As well as pinpointing the exact location of nearby public toilets, helpful information is featured about each one including whether there’s a charge and  it has an attendant. There is also a tool which lets users set preferences to highlight any specic needs they might have, such as whether it has disabled access and baby changing facilities, and what the opening hours are.

A European study of 2,000 employees in the UK, France and Germany found the typical staff member spends a total of 187 hours - or the equivalent of 23 days a year - in meetings. The bad news is 56 per cent of those get-togethers are generally \u0027unproductive\u0027 - and 66 per cent of those polled even admitted they make excuses in order to avoid meetings. The research by business travel hotel brand Crowne Plaza Hotel \u0026amp Resorts also found one in 10 will pretend they got the time or date wrong, and one in 20 even admitted to calling in sick to get out of a meeting entirely. Mike Greenup, vice president brand management, said: “Meetings are essential for collaboration and reaching business goals, but ensuring catch-ups are effective isn’t always simple.  Experts also discovered most staff reckon 40 minutes is the ‘optimum’  for an effective meeting. Interestingly, the research found that German employees are the most likely to make excuses to duck out of meetings, with nearly three quarters confessing to doing so. By comparison, two-thirds of French employees and just more than half of UK professionals do the same. One reason employees excuse themselves from meetings may be due to the amount of catch-ups viewed as ineffective. More than one in three admit to switching off during meetings lasting too long, deeming more than half of get-togethers they attend as ‘unproductive’. Shockingly, nearly a quarter have witnessed someone else falling asleep, and a similar number have sent personal messages during a professional gathering . It also emerged employees are more likely to enjoy a meeting  it is held off-site and involves free food and drink. Over a third would get more enjoyment from a meeting with a relaxed atmosphere, and nearly two thirds would prefer for someone else to organise and run the meeting. Nearly two-thirds agreed mornings are generally better for meetings, with meetings between 9:30am and 11:30am revealed as the prime time for professional gatherings. The study showed that meeting pet peeves were also universal. Respondents said the most frustrating things about meetings, were people talking over each other, meeting rooms that are too hot or cold and people who arrive late.

Corinne Hutton, 48, became a quadruple amputee five years ago and was given a five per cent chance of surviving the potentially fatal infection. She also had part of her lung removed last year - making her more at risk of altitude sickness. But despite her disabilities, single mum Corrine is preparing to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania on October 1 to raise cash for the charity she founded. The ascent is expected to take five days, and she will be joined by ten other fundraisers.  Corrine said: Initially a lot of people tried to warn me against it, saying that the risks outweigh the rewards. I\u0027ve taught my son to never say \u0027I can\u0027t\u0027 so it wouldn\u0027t be fair  I said it. If it\u0027s down to determination and the ability to keep going, I\u0027ll get to the top.

Hopefully others will see my efforts and want to be the best they can be. The mother, from Lochwinnoch, Renfrewshire, has been building up her strength by working out with a personal trainer, doing Pilates and swimming. In 2015 she was the first female quadruple amputee to summit Ben Nevis and recently climbed to the summit of Ben Lomond. According to the NHS, early symptoms of sepsis may include:  a high temperature  or low body temperature chills and shivering a fast heartbeat fast breathing  In some cases, symptoms of more severe sepsis or septic shock  develop soon after. These can include:  feeling dizzy or faint a change in mental state – such as confusion or disorientation diarrhoea  nausea and vomiting slurred speech severe muscle pain severe breathlessness less urine production than normal – for example, not urinating for a day cold, clammy and pale or mottled skin loss of consciousness.

This combination of extreme physique combined with dark black contact lenses has led fans to liken her to an alien. Are you from this universe? questions one fan, while others comment on Bakhar\u0027s looks saying certainly the most gorgeous alien I\u0027ve ever seen.

According to local legend, the bizarre occurrence of twinning started on the island generations ago. Now there are 78 pairs of non-identical twins and 22 pairs of identical twins – including one pair of conjoined twins. Many of siblings continue to wear identical outfits even after they enter into adulthood, making it really impossible for outsiders to dferentiate one sibling from the other. In the Alabat island, four-month-old Gian and John are the youngest twins with the oldest twins Eudosia Meras and Antonina Meras in their 80s.  Scientists and doctors alike have been baffled as to why so many twins are born on the island. Although there is no government data on the twinning, a 2015 report conducted by the state, recorded the birth of 12 twins in the single year in the tiny island. With the rate of twins increasing, local doctors and the scientists are now busy studying the medical marvel that, they say, would prove to be beneficial for childless couples. To date, only a single village in India, are known to have the highest number of twins. The small village of Kodinhi in Kerala in southern India had reported the presence of around 300-350 twins within the boundaries of the same village. Doctors in the Philippines have ruled out the genetic reason as to why the twinning keeps happening in these pockets, they believe that the environment has more to do with it. Although some suggested that the drinking water should be studied. The 86-year-old grandmothers Eudosia and Antonina Meras are believed to be the oldest twins living in the island. Both widowed, the pair say they support one another.  Antononia who got married at an early age of 19 explains how her husband dferentiated between her and her twin sister. “In the initial days, my husband would often mistake Eudosia for myself. There have been some embarrassing incidents when my husband amorous overtures to my sister thinking that it was me. I had to then show him the mole on my nose, while my sister doesn’t have it. That solved the problem once and for all,” said Antononia. Her sister Eudosia chirpy like a teenager pitched and showed the mole on her lips: “See, I have a mole on my lower lips that why I am very talkative. ‘In our letime, we noticed that there are twins like us in the island. Most of us wear an identical pair of clothes and people have the dilemma of identying who is who, the grandmother of four added. Four of Eudosia’s grandchildren are twins.

Pyotr, a vocal critic of Russian President Vladimr Putin, fell into a coma last week following a court hearing and was rushed to hospital. The Mediazona publisher regained consciousness last week and was then transported to Germany for treatment. Pyotr temporarily lost his sight, hearing and ability to walk, but is doing better since he arrived in Germany on Saturday.  It is highly probable that he was poisoned, Kai-Uwe Eckardt, a doctor at the Charite university hospital in Berlin, told a news conference, adding that there was no other explanation so far for Verzilov\u0027s condition. He said Verzilov was suffering from anti-cholinergic syndrome, a condition in which certain neurotransmitters get blocked. The rapid onset of symptoms - including widely dilated pupils, high blood pressure and dry mucous membranes - was strongly indicative of a poison, Eckardt said. He added: “We assume he has an intoxication lasting almost a week now. The clinical findings speak for a specic drug group, but the substance is unknown”.  Karl Max Einhaeupl, chairman of the Charite hospital, said Pyotr improves day by day and he is no longer at risk.

Civilians described gang rapes on an industrial scale, toddlers being swung against tree trunks until they were dead and families barricaded in their homes to be burned alive. When a mother fled from one inferno carrying a small baby she was shot and the child crushed to death by a soldier, an eye-witness said. The testimony was gathered from 100 people who survived an offensive in Unity State, in the northern Greater Upper Nile region of the country, between April and July this year. Government troops are accused of giving free rein to youth militias, unleashing a wave of systematic slaughter. The epicentre of the violence was Mayendit and Leer counties, areas held by the opposition.  Witnesses described civilians being slaughtered in their villages. Some were burned alive in their tukuls - traditional mud huts which often have a thatched roof. A man believed to be over 90 had his throat slit. Nyaweke, a 20-year-old woman, said she saw soldiers shoot dead her father and kill a number of children in Thonyoor, in Leer There were seven men [soldiers] who collected the children and put them into a tukul and they set the tukul on fire. I could hear the screaming. They were four boys. One boy tried to come out and the soldiers closed the door on him. There were also five boys whom they hit against the tree, swinging them. They were two [or] three years old. They don’t want especially boys to live because they know they will grow up to become soldiers. In a separate incident in Rukway village, also in Leer, a couple and their two grandsons were burned alive in a house. Their daughter attempted to flee with her baby but she was shot and her child stamped to death. Even those who fled their villages had little chance of survival. Soldiers used amphibious vehicles to hunt those who had fled into swamps.  Nyalony, an elderly woman, told Amnesty she witnessed soldiers killing her husband and two other men: When the attack started, early in the morning while we were sleeping, my husband and I ran to the swamp together. Later in the morning, after the fighting was over, the soldiers came into the swamp looking for people, and sprayed the area where we were hiding with bullets. My husband was hit he cried out in pain. He was still alive, though, and the soldiers caught him, and then they shot him again and killed him. He was unarmed and wasn’t a fighter just a farmer.” Survivors faced unspeakable horror. Women and young girls said that they were abducted before being gang raped, sometimes for many weeks. Others were used as slaves to cook and clean for their captors. A 60-year-old man found his niece after she had been sexually assaulted by five men. She was just 13. My brother’s daughter was raped and she was going to die, he said. When they raped her, we came and found her and she was crying and bleeding … she couldn’t hide … she told me she was raped by five men. We could not carry her and she could not walk. There were also reports of sexual mutilation and castration.  Nyatap, who is around 32, gave a graphic account of her ordeal. Eight months pregnant, she was abducted with her five-year-old son and daughter, seven. There were 20 soldiers, she said. The other women who are not pregnant were raped. There was another lady... she was three months\u0027 pregnant and she miscarried. She was raped by 10 men. I saw it happen. They were just raping her under another tree. They put us in one compound.... there were other ladies... They would take turns raping them. Soldiers accused of carrying out the slaughter are also said to have looted and burned on a vast scale, making it virtually impossible for survivors who had fled to  to their homes. Amnesty claims that the situation was enabled by South Sudan\u0027s government failing to prosecute suspected war criminals for previous massacres in 2016. Four people had been identied but no action had been taken. Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East Africa, said: “A key factor in this brutal offensive was the failure to bring to justice those responsible for previous waves of violence targeting civilians in the region. “Leer and Mayendit counties have been hard hit in the past, and yet the South Sudanese government continues to give suspected perpetrators free rein to commit fresh atrocities. The result has been catastrophic for civilians.” Amnesty has called for immediate end to all human rights abuses. Joanne Mariner, Amnesty International’s Senior Crisis Response Adviser, said: “It’s impossible to ignore the cruel reality –  the South Sudanese authorities had acted on our warnings back in 2016, this latest wave of violence against civilians in Leer and Mayendit might have been avoided. The only way to break this vicious cycle of violence is to end the impunity enjoyed by South Sudanese fighters on all sides. The government must ensure that civilians are protected and that those responsible for such heinous crimes are held to account.

Her new book, Full Disclosure, she describes her alleged tryst with the President of the United States and brands it as the ‘least impressive’ she’s ever had.   According to a copy seen by  , she says: He knows he has an unusual penis.  It has a huge mushroom head. Like a toadstool… “I lay there, annoyed that I was getting f***ed by a guy with Yeti pubes and a d*** like the mushroom character in Mario Kart...  The former stripper, whose real name is Stephanie Clford, goes on to claim Trump\u0027s penis is \u0027smaller than average but not freakishly small\u0027. The Mario character she appears to be referring to is called Toad, who looks like a cross between a man and a mushroom and has appeared in the popular Nintendo series since the late 1980s. Daniels claims she had an affair with Trump in 2006. This was around the time that the Apprentice star’s we Melania had given birth to their son Barron.  She added that she would dedicate the tell-all, which is due to hit shelves on October 2, to her young daughter. However she added that she would have to wait ‘until she is of a certain age’ before allowing her to read it. Daniels previously said on the ABC television show The View: You really didn’t think I would hold anything back? I’m gonna write everything and include it and people can think what they want about me but at least it’s the truth – it’s not like that they haven’t been thinking that about me anyway. The book is set to fill in details that were cut from her TV interview with the CBS show 60 Minutes which was recorded earlier this year. She said: Everybody knows that a lot of the 60 minutes  was cut down for time. There are things that I said in my interview that I really wanted people to know, that were very important to me, that I didn’t get to say.  Daniels has been working on the tell-all for about ten years, which will also discuss her career in strip clubs and the porn industry. While Trump has publicly denied the affair, his personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations linked to hush money he paid Daniels through a front company.

Alan Cumming, national estate agency director at Aberdein Considine, said this was the first clear sign of the museum having an impact on the city’s property market.He said: “Dundee has been undergoing a renaissance as this magnicent new landmark takes shape on the banks of the Tay.“The city has a growing UK and global profile and with more than 500,000 people expected to visit over the next year, this is only going to grow.“Dundee is one of the most affordable cities in the UK for first-time buyers, which makes it a popular choice for young house-hunters.“We may well be at the beginning of a period of sustained price growth and I am incredibly optimistic about what the future holds for the city’s property market.”Across Scotland as a whole, prices have soared to a record high of £169,450 after a summer market heatwave inflated prices in 27 out of the country’s 32 local authority areas.But more than three-quarters of the people surveyed by Scotland’s Property Monitor indicated that they had no intention of buying a new home, up from 43% in the first quarter.Back in July, the Tele revealed how house prices in Dundee had increased by 1.5% in May, which contributed to a 5.4% rise over the last 12 months.During that time, the average property in the area sold for £121,580 – signicantly lower than the UK average of £226,351.Buyers who made their first step on to the property ladder in the City of Discovery in May spent an average of £104,591.In September last year, it was reported by Aberdein Considine that property prices in Dundee were rising twice as fast as the Scottish average.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united gaffer csaba laszlo blasts referee after spot kick call","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United manager Csaba Laszlo has hit out at referee Colin Steven after he gave a controversial penalty against his side on Saturday.Steven pointed to the spot on 11 minutes when debutant Rachid Bouhenna was adjudged to have fouled Morton defender Gregor Buchanan in the box from a corner.Michael Tidser stepped up to give the ’Ton the lead in a Championship game which finished 1-1 thanks to substitute Fraser Fyvie’s last-minute equaliser.Although Csaba was pleased with the fight they showed to win a point, he was frustrated at the referee’s performance.“I am really proud of the boys because it was a really dficult game,” he said.“You get a penalty against you, and I don’t want to talk about the performance of the referee because it’s not my job, but I thought it was a foul for us at first.“I didn’t hear the whistle, then the referee shows for the penalty but I think, to be honest,  he gives this penalty then he has the chance to give 10 others for both sides.“It’s just my opinion and it is not all about the penalty. I don’t want to criticise the referee but, according to me, it was a very soft penalty.“I asked my players  there was contact there but they didn’t think it was one which you have to give.”Of United’s display, Csaba added: “I think for 90 minutes plus added time we played one-way football.“The boys tried hard and it’s not easy when the clock is ticking down and you still can’t score.“In the first-half we had two very good chances where we should score and in the second half we were pressing Morton.“They were, more or less, 11 behind the ball playing very deep and they tried to counter attack.“Sometimes you have these games where you have to suffer but we have to be more clinical, must be more clinical.“We can talk about the many mistakes but we have to play faster, more with the ball into feet and up front but I think on Saturday everybody showed spirit.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b9b902a01761.jpg ","title":"dundee united new boy booth says he shouldnt have tried to run off injury","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCallum Booth admits had he been a Dundee United veteran instead of a rookie, two months into the season Arabs would have seen a lot more of him than they have.The 27-year-old is ready for today’s Championship clash with Morton at Tannadice and,  he completes the 90 minutes, it will be the first time since his debut in mid-July.That’s when he damaged ankle ligaments in the Betfred Cup defeat at Ross County, an injury suffered early on in the tie.It could have forced him off immediately but the fact he played on was, he admits, a mistake on his part that was caused by him being new to the team.“Firstly, it’s been good to be back, obviously being out for five weeks was a long time,” said the former Partick Thistle defender.“It felt like ages, especially when you join a new club because you just want to make good impressions and get games under your belt right away.“It was my ankle, I did in it in the first half at Ross County and quite stupidly played on.“The physio came on, had a look and I thought I could probably run it off. I did feel it for the rest of the game but being at a new club you just want to show up well in your first game.“If I’d been here a couple of years I would have come off but, because it was my first game, I stayed on and probably made it worse – I woke up the next day and it was agony.“The result was five weeks out and that wasn’t ideal but it’s in the past now and I’m raring to go.”What he isn’t doing is expecting to walk right back into the team and he knows, in the shape of fellow left-back Jamie Robson, he’s facing strong competition for that defensive berth.“Jamie has been doing really well, he’s a good player and it’s good to have competition. There are a few boys still out and they’re coming back, so there’s going to be even more and that can only be good for the squad.“I feel that, when we have everyone fit, we have a very strong squad and it’s just going to be a case of getting everyone fit and keeping it that way. There are always injuries, though, it’s part and parcel of football.”His mission now is to help however he can as United look to keep picking up points to mount a strong promotion challenge.The aim today is to pick up three points. He knows that will not be easy against a Morton side who will be something of an unknown quantity after their recent change of manager.It saw ex-United boss Ray McKinnon quit after just three months in chare to take over at Falkirk and former Rangers star Jonatan Johansson replace him.“Any team that gets a new manager, they usually take a couple of weeks to implement what the new man is trying to do. This is Johansson’s first game in charge so we are not really too sure how they’ll set up.“One thing we know is they have good inidual players and experience in there as well in the middle of the park.“It’s going to be a tough game and they are a good side. They’ve had a good couple of seasons where they’ve always been in or close to the play-offs and done well in a few cups.”For United the aim is to build on a three-game unbeaten run that’s seen seven points taken from the last nine, though Booth believes it should have been a full house.“We are going not too bad but,  we want to be winning the league, we have to be holding on to results like the one we should have had at Alloa last time out.“We didn’t play great but 1-0 going into the last 10 minutes, we should have seen the game out.

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0027 historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0027 committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0027 financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0027 a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Wednesday 19 Sep 2018 2:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117524.jpg","title":"Black Isle riders go the distance","story":"\u0026nbspPLANS to develop top-notch all-weather sports facilities in a Black Isle village took a step forward last week when 25 riders saddled up in Avoch for a 50-mile ride around the peninsula.The Vuelta de Isla Negra \u0026mdash translated as cycle around the Black Isle \u0026mdash was inspired by a Spanish event which takes place at the same time and saw members of the business community team up to chase a \u0026pound300,000 fundraising target for the facilities in Avoch.Law firm Ledingham Chalmers, which has offices in Inverness, Aberdeen, Stirling and Edinburgh, staged the event on Friday in support of Avoch Amenities Association\u0027 bid to transform an old bowling green into tennis and all-weather multi-sports courts with changing facilities.Senior associate Roddy Cormack came up with the idea for the event last year.

It is also not uncommon for councils to push consultation dates back in order for extra views to be aired.Meanwhile, the creator of one of the petitions in favour of the march has spoken of her delight at the amount of support they have received.Alice Masheter said the response had been \"fantastic\" and that, even though she is not a member of the LGBT+ community, she had felt compelled to set a petition up in solidarity to show that everyone is \"accepted and welcomed up here\".She said the pro-march petitions show that the LGBT+ community \"do have a huge amount of support\" and anti-march views are \"in the minority\".Wednesday 19 Sep 2018 2:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116850.jpg","title":"New social enterprise cafe set for grand opening","story":"\u0026nbspA QUIRKY caf\u0026eacute that could be run by former prisoners in an attempt to reduce re-offending rates is opening in Inverness this week.The venue at 86 Church Street called Ar n-\u0026Agraveite, which translates to Our Place, will be officially opened by Inverness MP Drew Hendry at noon on Thursday.It aims to \u0026lsquorebuild\u0026rsquo people\u0027 lives after jail, giving them work and a chance to be a part of society.More than 50 volunteers are needed in the first year to run the venture and make it financially viable.Andrew Fowler, from the charity Signpost, which is spearheading the caf\u0026eacute scheme, said: \"We genuinely believe that we will be preparing people for work.

They have won just once in five Premiership games and now trail leaders Hearts by nine points.McInnes said: “It wasn’t a case of having a go at them as there was plenty of honesty and effort from the players, who were trying to do the right things.“But we are here to get results.“It is not just about being the better team or playing well, it is about getting the job done.“And laying a glove on them and trying to land a punch on them in the penalty box and we didn’t. In the second half we were much better and far more of what we needed.”That struggle to “lay a glove” on the opponents in the penalty area has been an on-going theme so far this season with the club’s recognised strikers scoring just two goals so far.Stevie May, a £400,000 signing last summer, has scored once and teenage centre-forward Bruce Anderson has also found the back of the net.On-loan Manchester United striker James Wilson has struggled with a tight hamstring and has featured just once as a substitute since his switch from the Premier League giants.Ultimately it came down to winger McGinn producing a moment of magic from a dead-ball situation to salvage a draw and prevent a second straight loss following the 2-0 defeat to Kilmarnock.McInnes said: “That was always a trademark of Niall’s, being able to come up with big moments in a game to score in those type of situations.“It was a fantastic goal and just what we needed.“Niall had been close as keepers have made good saves and he had also hit the bar and post a couple of times“After that goal St Johnstone then tried to stem the tide as the momentum was with us.“A draw is not the result we wanted.“When you go away from home to a tough venue, with St Johnstone doing all right this season, we will take our point.”Aberdeen had seven players injured and Mikey Devlin suspended for the trip to Perth.Midfielder Lewis Ferguson was ruled out 24 hours before kick-off with a knee injury sustained in training and remains a doubt for Saturday’s game with Motherwell at Pittodrie.Devlin will  to face the Steelmen after a one-game suspension.McInnes hopes striker Wilson will be in contention to make his first start for the Dons at the weekend.Also ruled out through injury at Perth were Mark Reynolds , Tommie Hoban , Scott Wright , Frank Ross  and Greg Tansey .\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"weir is third inductee to aberdeen hall of fame 2018","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen legend Peter Weir is the third member of the Hall of Fame class of 2018.Weir, 60, who was part of the Reds team which beat Real Madrid to the European Cup Winners\u0026#8217 Cup in 1983, made 237 appearances over seven years and scored 38 goals.Signed from St Mirren by Sir Alex Ferguson in 1981, he was also pivotal in the Super Cup win over German side Hamburg, as well as the 3-1 UEFA Cup win over English top-flight Ipswich Town at Pittodrie.He left the Dons for Leicester City in 1988.Weir said: “It was a dream playing for your local side St Mirren then getting a big move to a club you had supported.\u0026#8220It was great to have won many honours with Aberdeen and also being capped by Jock Stein –six times – playing for your country.

Chris, 33, of the city centre, who will finish the project this week, said: “Part of it was because of the nature of my work, it’s quite easy for me to spend an entire day without leaving the building.“It was partly because I wanted an excuse to leave the house and speak to another human being every day.“Beyond that, I didn’t really have any objectives.”Most of the people he met were in Aberdeen, and two thirds of the people who were photographed had volunteered to take part. He said: “There were a couple of times I had to chase people down the street saying ‘excuse me’.“I started off with friends and family and former colleagues, but people started coming to me.“The vast majority have been people who have approached me.“There’s no way I would have been able to do it myself just having to approach people in the street.“It ended up being a snowball effect.“The idea of doing a picture a day is not something I dreamed up, it’s something a lot of photographers do.” Working as a wedding photographer, Chris often has to work with a backdrop that is outwith his control, so the project allowed him to look at dferent technical aspects while fuelling his love for portrait photography.He said: “It ties in with my interests. I like taking pictures of people.“Taking a picture of a dferent person every day meant I couldn’t fall back on the same people every day. I’ve allowed myself a bit of flexibility as well.”Although two thirds of his portraits ended up being volunteers, it wasn’t always easy to get people to take part.Chris likened the process to the famine and the feast, and said there were times he struggled to get back to people in time and others when he had only six hours left to find someone.With the end of the project nearing, he will be relaxing for a bit, but hopes to continue on the project in the future.He added: “I definitely want to keep doing something. Who knows, maybe in three months’ time.”There will be an exhibition held at Foodstory, which will begin in early October, upstairs in the cafe.To view the project, visit www.instagram/chrshndrsn.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"every picture taken for aberdeen photographers instagram portrait project","story":"\t\t\t\t\tEvery day for the last year Aberdeen photographer Chris Henderson has captured a portrait a day \u0026#8211 here we show every single picture taken so far.Daily lives explored as Aberdeen photographer goes face to face for year-long Instagram project\" src=\"https:www.eveningexpress/fp/news/local/daily-lives-explored-as-aberdeen-photographer-goes-face-to-face-for-year-long-portrait-project/embed/#?secret=jpVp6MTMOo\" data-secret=\"jpVp6MTMOo\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"\u0026#8220Daily lives explored as Aberdeen photographer goes face to face for year-long Instagram project\u0026#8221 \u0026#8212 Evening Express\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/09/3D-image-reduced-size-BW-732x564.jpg ","title":"plan to turn aberdeens victoria school into homes and community facilities approved","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA bid to turn a former Aberdeen school into homes and community facilities has been approved.Aberdeen City Council’s City Growth and Resources Committee awarded Grampian Housing Association  \u0026#8220preferred bidder\u0026#8221 status for Victoria Road School in Torry. 100vw, 620px\" /GHA is working with the Torry Development Trust for affordable homes while retaining the historic granite building.Convener of the committee and Aberdeen City Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden said: “This bid has the potential to deliver much-needed social housing as well as community facilities.“By working in partnership with Registered Social Landlords, Aberdeen City Council can deliver homes for those who need them.”Watch: Take a look inside Aberdeen\u0026#8217s Victoria Road School\" src=\"https:www.eveningexpress/fp/news/local/watch-take-a-look-inside-aberdeens-victoria-road-school3/embed/#?secret=jznOdoWoaO\" data-secret=\"jznOdoWoaO\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"\u0026#8220Watch: Take a look inside Aberdeen\u0026#8217s Victoria Road School\u0026#8221 \u0026#8212 Evening Express\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"two year old north east beauty pageant contestant raises 700 for charity","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA young pageant contestant has helped raise £700 for charity.New Deer two-year-old Amelia Cardno  ho is vying to be a pageant queen at Miss United Elite Scotland in March next year, held a fun day at Aden Country Park.Mum Caprice Clark, 20, organised the day, which raised the cash for the Scottish Association of Mental Health.Caprice said: “Mental health is something that affects everyone at one point or another, so we just thought that we could put on a little fun day, maybe raise a couple of hundred pounds.“I didn’t think that it would go as well as it did, but we counted up at the end of the day and we had raised just over £700, I was absolutely thrilled.”Amelia was the star of the show at the fun day, held last month, according to Caprice.

If they are not at home when we deliver, they will now receive email/SMS notications on the whereabouts of their delivery. For customers who have provided their contact details, the notications will confirm when their items have been delivered to a neighbour, as well as specying the neighbour’s address.The \u0026#8216Something for You\u0026#8217 card is also going digital, making it easier for customers to retrieve their item  they are not at home when we deliver.

Customers will no longer need to go home to collect the physical card \u0026#8211 which we’ll continue to post through letter boxes.And finally customers taking pre-paid parcels  to selected Royal Mail Customer Service Points will receive an acceptance scan as soon as they drop off their item thanks to new scanning technology.Gerry McAuley, delivery director, Glasgow Mail Centre.Sir,The Supreme Court appears to have come to a sensible decision for the terminally ill in its landmark right-to-die ruling.One year ago my adult children and I watched helplessly as a most loved, mentally alert member of our family, with terminal cancer, suffered a needlessly horrible and prolonged death.This, after the patient had pleaded, for two weeks, with family doctors and religious leaders to end the constant suffering by requesting some form of assisted dying.This Supreme Court decision has come too late for our loved one but hopefully Westminster and Holyrood will now each consider and pass a bill to allow assisted dying and prevent suffering for current and future patients.Gordon Caskie, Muasdale.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 3:16 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSomething slightly dferent in this edition.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live le as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them. Throughout September, headline partner M\u0026ampS will be selling a selection of limited edition coffee morning products \u0026#8211 including lots of cakes, biscuits and two exclusive mugs \u0026#8211 with 10 per cent of proceeds going to Macmillan.Homes, workplaces and communities from the Shetland Islands to Land’s End will be hosting coffee mornings this year readers in Argyll and Bute can find events nearby using the interactive map on the Coffee Morning website www.macmillan.org.uk/coffee.Thank you to everyone who gets involved.Joanna Lumley, actress and Macmillan supporterSir,The SNP announced it is starting up a new \u0026#8216fact-checking\u0026#8217 service to monitor the accuracy of research and political statements.Many people in Scotland will be wondering  the SNP will be fact-checking the cost of its new independence blueprint.

The kids have had a great time with their teams playing well, building team spirit and creating a positive impression of the soccer centre and Lochgilphead.The Red Star 2007 team as well as regularly taking part in the Oban Primary League has travelled to Mossend, Oban, Crieff, Campbeltown and Helensburgh.  The kids are really developing and getting ready to move up to nine aside from now and then eleven aside in August 2019. The 2008 team has been to Mossend, Oban, Ardencaple, Campbeltown, Helensburgh, Finnart and Airdrieonians and have also been taking part in the Oban Primary League.The 2009s, 2010s and 2011s have been on trips to Oban, Campbeltown and Helensburgh. The kids played four and five aside as well as being committed to regular additional training sessions. The future looks good for when they step up to seven aside.Finally the girls team took part in both Oban and Campbeltown festivals. The enthusiastic girls have developed enormously in the last nine months. It\u0026#8217s great to see such an active group of girls growing from around eight girls this time last year to nearly 20 now.The action continues with teams due to take part in Haldane and Lochnell festivals in September.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 36","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 09/09/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe photograph this week was taken by Colin Cameron of the Argyllshire Advertiser.It was captured on a Huawei P9 mobile phone, and Colin said: \u0026#8216I just spotted the bee while out on the hill walking the dogs.

Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC.

The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"red star exit cup after disappointing performance","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 15/09/18, 11:10 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Red Star crashed out of the Scottish Cup on Saturday after an error-strewn replay performance was punished by a clinical Southside team.As in the original tie, Red Star got off to a terrible start, finding themselves two goals down inside 20 minutes after sloppy errors. To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust. The next championships will be held at Inveralmond Community High School, Livingston, on Sunday March 10 2019.More details are on our website \u0026#8211 www.thechampionships.Last March, 145 schools from Scotland and two from England were represented at the championships, with a category for all standards of playing.Five years ago we introduced a new category of \u0026#8216freestyle\u0026#8217.  The aim of this is to provide an opportunity for schools to showcase their other musical skills alongside those of their pipers.The Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust  hopes many young pipers and drummers from Mid Argyll \u0026#8211 with other musicians too  entering the freestyle event – will participate in next year’s championships.Patrick Gascoigne, administrator, Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"achnaba blackie lambs win james weir trophy","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 17/09/18, 6:51 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowUnited Auctions held its annual Dalmally show and sale of blackface wedder lambs, sponsored by the Blackface Sheep Breeders\u0026#8217 Association, on Saturday September 8.Including all classes of cross bred lambs and feeding sheep there was a catalogued entry of 8,002 of lambs and sheep, selling to a packed ringside of buyers.William Dunlop of Elmscleugh judged the ious classes of blackface lambs and his awards are as follows:  First and champion pen, taking the James Weir Memorial Trophy – Achnaba \u0026#8211 £58.In second place was Tullochan \u0026#8211 £51 and third Tayvallich Estate \u0026#8211 £45.50.In line with other centres lambs were weighing two to three kg lighter on the year.

This will involve intense physiotherapy blocks, the purchase of specialised equipment and working closely with ious professional therapists to get him strong enough. This will take some time but no dream will ever be too big for our boy, it might just take a little longer to get there.” Saul was born with twin brother Clay 12 weeks’ premature. Clay weighed 3lbs and Saul just 1lb. Clay was treated at Crosshouse Hospital near Kilmarnock for three months to allow his lungs to develop and learn to feed and has now made a full recovery. However, Saul was kept in Yorkhill Hospital for six months and spent most of his first year in hospital as he was so fragile. At 18 months old, he was diagnosed with Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy. When Karen was pregnant with the twins, she and her husband Stuart were given the devastating news that Clay had a better chance of survival  Saul were to be terminated, something that was never option for them. Karen said: “We were told on several occasions that Saul was too tiny to survive but he continues to defy the experts and he is our little fighter.” Not a keen runner, Karen – who gave up work when the twins were born and cares for Saul on a full-time basis – is taking on the 10k with a group of 25 friends and her 66-year-old mum in order to raise the \u0026pound80,000 needed to take Saul to America. Karen said: “I am not a runner, but have been training three times a week for the event and can now manage to run 4.5 miles. My mum has never done anything like this before so is extremely nervous but very determined to complete the race for her grandson. “Our fundraising total is set at \u0026pound80,000 to cover my son’s surgery, specialised equipment, intense physio and a two- year rehabilitation programme. We have been campaigning for 18 weeks and have raised an incredible \u0026pound41,000 so far. “We have been overwhelmed by the kindness of friends and family who are willing to help raise funds for Saul’s journey, their generosity is very much appreciated and our family are exceedingly grateful to everyone who’s helped us on this journey. “We were extremely proud when Saul started school with his twin Clay and older brother Mylo, eight, this year. He attends Tarbolton Primary School and has several classroom assistants who support him depending on what activities are being done each day. “Like every parent we long for endless opportunities for our son. We are exceedingly grateful to everyone who has supported us on Saul’s journey to help make his dream come true – to walk like his brothers.” The run is on Sunday, September 30.

Jockey Oisin Murphy has made this year his own, riding the crest of the proverbial wave to land another Group 1 victory. It was always the worry that enigmatic HARRY ANGEL would lose his race in the stalls which he sadly did. It was a proper thrill to watch last years Arc winner ENABLE  to the track after a y absence with a decisive victory over CRYSTAL OCEAN. The John Gosden trained filly is now as short as 9/4 to retain her crown at Longchamp on October 7. With five Group 1 victories to her name you have to fancy her chances. For most of us the daily commute to work is no more hazardous than the annoyance of a late bus or a car that won’t start. Few will use a single engine plane or helicopter. It may look glamorous from the outside but for top trainers and jockeys who are engaged at two tracks on the same day it is an essential form of transport. The perils involved were highlighted on Saturday when trainer Richard Hannon’s plane collided with another on landing at a rain sodden Haydock. Mercully the only damage was to the clipped wings of the aircraft. Lets not always envy those who look as though they are living the high le. The climax to four days of racing at Doncaster comes this Saturday at 3:35pm in the final Classic of the season. Early in the week Aidan O’Brien’s KEW GARDENS was a rock solid favourite at 5/4 with LAH TI DAR  a remote second. The money has come for the Andrew Lloyd-Webber owned filly who is now favourite at 15/8 while KEW GARDENS can be backed at 2/1. LAH TI DAR  is three wins from three starts. The latest of which, the Sir Henry Cecil Stakes at York’s Ebor Festival, was a 10  rout.  In the St Leger fillies are in receipt of a 3lb weight allowance against the colts in this 1 mile 6 marathon. It is a race that John Gosden excels in  having won it four times previously. Connections are confident the step up in trip will suit her strong galloping style and that any ease in the ground will suit the daughter of DUBAWI. With just one race this summer she should arrive at post on Saturday fresh as a daisy. In contrast this will be KEW GARDENS\u0027 fth engagement of the campaign. One we like and who has stamina in abundance is KEW GARDENS\u0027 stablemate SOUTHERN FRANCE at 14/1. Lightly raced, this son of GALLILEO has caught the eye on more than one occasion despite running a touch green in second behind KEW GARDENS in the Queen’s Vase at Royal Ascot. SOUTHERN FRANCE  looks the value each way bet. In a tactical race he may be up in the vanguard keeping LAH TI DAR honest, forcing a true gallop. If there is a flaw to be found in the new favourite as she steps up in trip and in to Group 1 company for the first time, SOUTHERN FRANCE will be sure to find it. It is a tactic that will suit KEW GARDENS whose best performances have come under a patient ride. Perhaps our selection will outstay them both.

is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a signicant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be signicantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see  there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by

team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite signicantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the

Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational signicance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as  it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.

The cake was made by food artist and cake sculptor Michelle Wibowo and was featured on Channel 4\u0027s tea-time programme Extreme Cake Makers.  The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.  She then printed the exterior of the shop onto edible paper, placing it onto the skeleton on the building.  For the finer details, Michelle used a sugar paste which she sculpted by hand.  The cake itself was crafted in Hayward\u0027s Heath, West Sussex, and then driven to Brighton, where Tranent-born George works.  \"He wanted to help revive the centre of town, so he\u0027s taken on a derelict building, and he\u0027s totally restoring it,\" said Sharon.  George bought the building on the corner of High Street in late 2015, and planned to renovate it into a mixture of shops, cafes\u0026nbspand a Post Office.  Upon seeing Michelle\u0027s creation, Sharon exclaimed: \"It\u0027s exactly what I wanted. It\u0027s got total wow factor. I think it\u0027s absolutely incredible. It just doesn\u0027t look like cake.\"  George, when he was finally let in on the surprise, agreed: \"When I first came in, I actually thought the cake was just a cardboard model. Then I realised it was actually a cake, and to see the level of detail and quality in doing something like that, it\u0027s quite fantastic.  \"I could take it home, put it in the building, and people would actually think it\u0027s an architect\u0027s model.\"  Sharon confirmed: \"George was absolutely blown away by the cake. He didn\u0027t want to cut it and was desperately trying to find a way to get it back to Scotland. We pointed out it wasn\u0027t possible because we wanted to eat it.  \"Michelle totally delivered on the cake, so she\u0027s probably the first person in George\u0027s le that has actually managed to do something to surprise him.\"  The show is available on Channel 4\u0027s streaming service All 4.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.

The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.

Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.  Since it opened, Torness has produced enough low-carbon electricity to save the equivalent of 84.8 million tonnes of CO2e  during its 30 years of operation, the same as taking all of the passenger cars off the UK\u0026rsquos roads for more than a year."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-womans-key-part-in-new-bbc-one-game-show-chase-the-case","story":"  The former Ross High School pupil plays a \u0026ldquofurious security guard in new strategy game Chase the Case, hosted by BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.

Mr Barnier also made clear that time to reach a deal was running out with his comment that the October summit would be the \u0026ldquomoment of truth.  Attention had been increasingly focused on the prospect of a special summit in November to finalise an agreement, however Mr Barnier said it should be clear before then whether a deal was actually possible.  European Council president Donald Tusk said EU leaders should discuss arrangements for the \u0026ldquofinal phase of the Brexit talks \u0026ldquoincluding the possibility of calling another European Council in November.  In a letter to leaders ahead of the Salzburg meeting he called on them to work on \u0026ldquolimiting the damage caused by Brexit.  \u0026ldquoUnfortunately, a no-deal scenario is still quite possible. But  we all act responsibly, we can avoid a catastrophe, he said."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8702771.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-they-have-already-paid-off","story":"  Citizens Advice said EE, Three and Vodafone routinely continued to charge customers for handsets after they had paid them off in full.  It warned that customers were often unaware they were being charged for handsets after their contracts had ended, even though they owned the phone and only needed to continue paying for calls, texts and data.  The most common mobile contracts are bundled deals, which typically last for two years and do not include information about the cost of the handset.  A study by the advisory service of more than 700 bundled contracts found that consumers would pay more than buying the phone outright in 73% of cases, despite 55% of consumers assuming it was the cheaper option.  On average customers are overcharged \u0026pound22 a month, but this was as high as \u0026pound38 for high-end phones such as an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy, the charity found.  The study found vulnerable people were at higher risk of being overcharged, with older people twice as likely to be charged for a phone they already owned for longer than 12 months at an potential average cost of \u0026pound264.  The advisory service is calling on the three companies to separate the cost of the phone from the mobile service \u0026ndash a practice already in place with other providers.  Ofcom is consulting on addressing the problem, but Citizens Advice said the regulator\u0026rsquos proposal of sending a single notication to customers before their contract ends does not go far enough.  Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: \u0026ldquoIt is unacceptable that mobile providers are knowingly overcharging customers for phones they already own.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove heard a lot of talk from Government and the regulator but now we need action. Other companies have already stopped doing this so we\u0026rsquore looking for these three major providers to follow suit.  \u0026ldquoIn the meantime, consumers should check their phone bills to see  they can save money with a SIM-only contract or upgrade to a new phone.  Digital minister Margot James said: \u0026ldquoIt is absolutely unacceptable for consumers to be charged for a product they have already bought. Mobile providers must make it clearer when a customer has paid off their handset and is in a position to switch to a cheaper deal.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with Ofcom and Citizens Advice to push for a fairer and more transparent system that helps people save money.  An EE spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe fully agree that customers shouldn\u0026rsquot overpay, but we believe that this is best achieved through clear communications with consumers about their options, and that the current proposals for separating phones and tarf is overly simplistic and doesn\u0026rsquot give the customers either the transparency or best deal that they deserve.  Three said: \u0026ldquoWe continue to look closely at the issue of handset financing and are working closely on this with the Government and regulators.  Vodafone said: \u0026ldquoWe already contact all of our customers when they are approaching the end of their minimum term to let them know their options.\u0026nbspThese include upgrading their handset or moving to a SIM-only contract so they are not paying anything for a handset.  An Ofcom spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe share concerns about customers paying more than they need to. People are not being given the information they need about their contracts, so we\u0026rsquove set out plans to force companies to tell customers when their minimum contract ends.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to work with Citizens Advice, Government and mobile providers and consider any necessary further action."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Salmond   s determination to clear his name could tear the SNP apart","story":"  The former First Minister is the most formidable fighter in politics and will not to go quietly into that good political night. His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7797102.jpg?type=article-full","title":"majority-of-scots-want-holyrood-to-control-immigration","story":"  A poll shows that 64% of Scots back immigration devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland giving them powers to decide how many visas are issued for people who want to work there.  A new report says just one in ten Scots think that the UK government has managed immigration competently and fairly and the authors say urgent action is need to restore public trust. Across the UK they are slightly more supportive with only 15% backing Britain\u0027s handling of immigration.  The figures come from the largest-ever public consultation on immigration, ahead of the independent Migration Advisory Committee\u0026rsquos immigration report on Tuesday expected to be pivotal to shaping Theresa May\u0026rsquos post-Brexit immigration policy.    Nicola Sturgeon has made repeated calls for a Scottish-specic immigration system in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.  But the Home Office believes that applying dferent immigration rules to dferent parts of the UK would complicate the system, harming its integrity, and cause dficulties for employers who they say need the flexibility to deploy their staff to dferent parts of the UK.  It says that it will engage with and consider the views of the Scottish Government and businesses when deciding on any action over the MAC findings.  The new report from the National Conversation on Immigration, co-ordinated by think tank British Future and anti-prejudice campaigners HOPE not hate, said that even the English agreed that Scotland should take control.  Some 55% across the UK said the devolved governments should have powers over immigration. The policy is also supported by half of those who live in the Midlands  and the south east  and by Leave  and Remain  voters.    Stuart McDonald, the SNP spokesman on immigration, asylum and border control said: \u0026ldquoThe support for devolution of migration powers recorded by the National Conversation is hugely signicant and welcome. Not only in Scotland, but across the UK, people have had enough of one-size-fits-all migration rules and do not believe that the UK government will deliver competent or fair migration policies.  \u0026ldquoIt is more urgent that ever for the UK government to devolve migration powers to the Scottish Parliament, so we can build a system that is designed to meet Scotland\u0026rsquos needs and aspirations \u0026ndash for example, a post-study work visa, rules that allow families to stay together, and visas that encourage people to work, start businesses and invest here.  The First Minister has argued that Scotland needs power over immigration to attract more people north of the border where there is a rapidly ageing population.    But earlier this month, CBI Director-General Carolyn Fairbairn, one of the most influential figures in British industry said that businesses are not ready for a separate Scottish immigration system.  Earlier this month, the Home Secretary unveiled a pilot scheme that will allow fruit and vegetable growers to recruit non-EU migrants as seasonal workers - but critics say it goes \"nowhere near\" far enough to plug a recruitment crisis in Scots fruit-picking industry.  The new report calls for an annual \u0026lsquoMigration Day\u0026rsquo in Parliament, where ministers are held accountable for their performance against a three-year immigration strategy that it says should replace the annual net migration target, and would have input from the devolved administrations.    Jill Rutter, director of strategy for British Future and co-author of the report, said: \u0026ldquoThe lack of trust we found in the government to manage immigration is quite shocking. People want to have their voices heard on the choices we make, and to hold their leaders to account on their promises.  \u0026ldquoWhile people do want the UK Government to have more control over who can come to the UK, most of them are \u0026lsquobalancers\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash they recognise the benefits of migration to Britain, both economically and culturally, but also voice concerns about pressures on public services and housing.  Rosie Carter of HOPE not hate, co-author of the report, added: \u0026ldquoImmigration is a national issue, but people see it through a local lens. Where people live, and their living conditions, makes a real dference \u0026ndash that includes the perceived impact of migration on their community, broader grievances about economic insecurity and levels of contact with migrants and ethnic minorities too.  \u0026ldquoAn official National Conversation on Immigration would give people a chance to express their concerns in a constructive debate, so anxieties are not driven underground or exploited by those seeking to stoke ision.    The research by ICM for the National Conversation, which polled 700 people in Scotland also found Scots were more positive about integration with 69% agreeing \u0026ldquoit is better when migrants commit to stay in Britain, put down roots and integrate, compared to 61% UK-wide.  And just 31% in Scotland agree that \u0026ldquoit is better when migrants come here to work for a few years without putting down roots and then  home\" against 39% UK-wide.  But the report also uncovered some dissenting voices in citizens\u0027 panels held across Scotland.  In four of the five citizens\u0026rsquo panels in Aberdeen, Dumfries, Edinburgh and Paisley \u0026ndash some participants felt that international students were taking the place of Scottish students.  \"This view was more surprising, given that these four citizens\u0026rsquo panels held many positive views about other forms of migration,\" said the report.  Students who live in Scotland or are from EU countries do not have to pay tuition fees in Scottish universities.    \"This seems to have fuelled a belief that Scotland\u0026rsquos universities prioritise international students from outside the EU over Scottish students for financial reasons,\" said the report.  \"However, our nationally representative ICM survey did not indicate any statistically signicant dference in the desire to reduce the number of international students in Scotland  compared with all of the UK .\"  And some over two out of three Scots were happy for the numbers of international students to be increased or remain at the same level.  The Home Office said: \"Our immigration system is designed to work for the whole of the UK. We have no current plans to introduce a devolved immigration system.  \"Scotland, as well as other devolved governments, have dferent ways available to encourage more iniduals and families to move to their part of the UK.  National Conversation on Immigration researchers held over 130 meetings in 60 locations across every nation and region of the UK, with citizens\u0026rsquo panels, recruited to be representative of the local population, in each place alongside meetings with local government, businesses, faith and civil society groups.  In Scotland, panels were held in Aberdeen, Dumfries, Edinburgh, Lerwick and Paisley.  Nationally representative research by ICM polled 3,667 people across the UK and an open online survey was completed by nearly 10,000 people.  Other Scottish findings  \u0026bull 62% agree that migrant workers support the British economy by doing jobs British people don\u0026rsquot want to do  \u0026bull 51% agree that public services are under strain because of immigration  \u0026bull 64% agree that migrants bring valuable skills for our economy and public services like the NHS  \u0026bull 51% agree that migrants are willing to work for less money so put jobs at risk and lower wages  \u0026bull 80% think the number of high-skilled migrants from the EU should remain the same or increase while 11% say they should be reduced.  \u0026bull 47% would like the number of low-skilled workers from the EU to be reduced while 34% think they should stay the same and 9% would like more.  \u0026bull 63% agree that the public should be consulted more on important national issues, like immigration.  Analysis:\u0026nbspScottish public are balancers  by Jill Rutter, Director of Strategy for British Future and co-author of the National Conversation on Immigration final report.    Immigration was one of the biggest issues of the EU referendum, but the public have not had a chance to say what should happen next.  The National Conversation on Immigration, jointly conducted by British Future and Hope not hate, is the largest ever public consultation on immigration.  Holding sixty citizens\u0026rsquo panels across the UK, including five in Scotland and a mixed English-Scottish panel in Berwick, it was a chance to hear the public\u0026rsquos voice.  These real-world conversations were constructive and pragmatic, in sharp contrast\u0026nbspto the more polarised online debate. We heard dferent views across Scotland: in Paisley, local faith and political leadership had shaped a public discourse that was more sympathetic to refugees and migrants than in similar places south of the border.  In Aberdeen, awareness of migration\u0026rsquos contribution to the oil industry was mixed with concerns about pressures on school places and housing. The Berwick citizens\u0026rsquo panel showed that views on migration can be toughest in places of low ersity and least contact.  Scotland has a distinctly more positive national immigration discourse. The Scottish public are balancers, seeing the gains of migration for the NHS and economy and wanting practical plans to manage the pressures too.  Asked to rate the overall impact of immigration on a 1-10 scale, the most common Scottish response is six out of ten, with a modest dference between the Scottish  and UK-wide  averages.  Views about whether Scotland should have more control over immigration policy often ided along independence referendum lines. There was more support in Paisley, while citizens in the Shetlands were firmly opposed.  But the sense that Westminster is distant and unlikely to consider Scotland\u0026rsquos needs transcends the independence question: a pro-Union panel in Edinburgh felt the City of London would dominate in decisions about future policy.  So 64% of Scots support devolving immigration powers, according to the survey that formed part of the National Conversation.    While political, business and civic society stakeholders saw a clear demographic need for immigration in Scotland, it was striking how the public were barely aware of the debate about future population needs. Scotland\u0026rsquos immigration \u0026lsquobalancers\u0026rsquo will be ready to hear that case, but a sustained national conversation on Scotland\u0026rsquos demographics will be needed for elite debate to be converted into a public one."},{"url":null,"title":"my-way-or-no-way-on-brexit-deal-theresa-may-insists","story":"  The Prime Minister, speaking in a BBC Panorama special on six months to go to Britain leaving the EU, made clear  Parliament later this year did not support her Chequers Plan, then \"the alternative to that will be having no deal\".  In further extracts from her interview, Mrs May was pushed on whether or not she had ruled out giving a special immigration arrangement for EU citizens and replied: \"What we will be doing is putting forward a set of rules for people from the European Union and people from outside the European Union.\"  She went on: \"Parliament will vote for a deal because people will see the importance of a deal that maintains a good trading relationship with the EU but also maintains good co-operation in other areas but gives us the freedom to take the benefits and opportunities of Brexit.\"  The PM cast doubt on whether or not the EU would offer a better deal  MPs were to reject her final proposal, adding: \"I believe we\u0027ll get a good deal we\u0027ll bring that back from the EU negotiations, put that to Parliament.  \u0026ldquoThe alternative to that will be not having a deal because a I don\u0027t think the negotiations will have that deal, and b we\u0027re leaving on March 29 2019.\"  But Sir Nick Clegg, the former Deputy PM, accused Mrs May of presenting Britain with a \"con trick\" choice on Brexit.  He explained: \"It is a deep disservice to our democratic traditions to have a Prime Minister now saying: \u0027You\u0027ve got no choices left, it\u0027s my fudge or the abyss\u0027 that is not true. We always have more choices  only we are prepared to take them.  \"Of all the con tricks we have been subject to in this whole sorry Brexit saga - from the lies in the referendum to the so-called virtues of what is nothing more than an inelegant fudge in Chequers - the worst is now to come, declared the former Liberal Democrat leader, who will be back in the spotlight today as he addresses a fringe event at the party\u0026rsquos annual conference in Brighton.  Mr Clegg said: \"We\u0027re now going to be told: \u0027It\u0027s my way or no way\u0027 it\u0027s either the Chequers fudge or a sort of cataclysmic clf-edge.  \"The idea that the only thing this country should accept is a fudge or the abyss is not only an insult to the intelligence of British voters but it\u0027s simply not true.\"  Sir Nick insisted that his experience as an MEP taught him that Britain would be given more time by the EU to reflect on what it wanted to happen ahead of the slated withdrawal date of next March.  \u0026ldquoThe clock is ticking but the clock can definitely be changed, he declared. \u0026ldquoOne thing that is very elastic in Brussels is time. They\u0027ve got a name for it. It\u0027s called \u0027stop the clock\u0027 and it is provided for in the EU treaties.\"  The former DPM said the UK could tell Brussels: \"\u0026rsquoI\u0027m sorry, we\u0027ve got a bit stuck here, we need more time to straighten ourselves out and decide what we want to do next.\u0026rsquo\"  He called for a pause in the withdrawal process so that the UK could hold a \"People\u0027s Vote\" on Brexit.  Sir Nick was scathing about the current Brexit situation, saying: \"It\u0027s the equivalent of leaving your home, locking your front door, chucking your key away and having absolutely no idea where you are going next.\"  The former party leader, who lost his Sheffield seat at the 2017 General Election, said he had been holding talks with European leaders on the Brexit situation to ensure the UK had more choices on what to do about its relationship with the EU.  In her BBC interview broadcast tonight, Mrs May also said she gets \u0026ldquoirritated by the debate about her leadership and criticised Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos controversial \u0026ldquosuicide vest comment.  Britain is heading full throttle for a total write-off of Brexit  it continues with Theresa May\u0027s disastrous plans for the Irish border, Boris Johnson has claimed.  The former Foreign Secretary launched another broadside against the PM\u0026rsquos Chequers Plan, saying the Irish border backstop deadlock was being used to force the UK into becoming a vassal state and that the talks were on course to end in a \"spectacular political car crash\".  Mr Johnson argued that the EU\u0026rsquos fall-back position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland being \"annexed\" by Brussels.  Alternative plans set out by Mrs May would \"effectively\" keep Britain in the bloc, he declared.  However, the PM has said the counter-proposal to her Chequers plan is \"still a hard border\" and hers is the only way that does not \"carve up the United Kingdom\".  His comments came as reports suggested the EU was preparing to accept the use of technology to avoid the need for new border infrastructure.  Mr Johnson has backed proposals by the pro-Brexit European Research Group that physical checks can be done away from the border, without keeping the UK or Northern Ireland tied to EU customs rules.  Writing in The Daily , he said: \"If the Brexit negotiations continue on this path they will end, I am afraid, in a spectacular political car crash.  \"If we are to get out of this mess and get the great British motor back on track, then we need to understand the Irish backstop and how it is being used to coerce the UK into becoming a vassal state of Brussels.  The former Cabinet minister claimed the EU\u0027s backstop would leave a border down the Irish sea while the UK\u0027s proposal left it \"volunteering\" to \"remain effectively in the customs union and large parts of the single market until Brussels says otherwise\".  Both versions of the backstop were \u0026ldquodisastrous,\" argued Mr Johnson. \"One threatens the Union the other version - and its close cousin, Chequers - keep us effectively in the EU, as humiliated rules-takers.  \"We need to challenge the assumptions of both these Irish backstops, or we are heading full throttle for the ditch with a total write-off of Brexit.  \"We are straining at the gnat of the Irish border problem - in fact we haven\u0027t even tried to chew the gnat - and we are swallowing the camel of EU membership in all but name,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-the-tories-are-snatching-away-hope-from-the-children-who-need-it-most","story":"  In its 2016 Holyrood manesto, they welcomed \u0026ldquothe Scottish Government\u0026rsquos recent decision to reintroduce national testing in primary schools. Now Ruth Davidson makes hay attacking the policy, and tries to kill it off.  The politicisation \u0026ndash the weaponisation \u0026ndash of childhood in Scotland stinks to high heaven and it does not edy the nation. Parents are being tormented by two-faced politicians deploying scare tactics about the education of their children. This is not debate, this is double-dealing of the worst order. Sadly, it has been this way for a long time.  From the issue of a Named Person to advocate for young people who might not have the support they need, through to baby boxes, free tuition fees for university students, the smacking ban and now national testing for primary school pupils, you would be forgiven \u0026ndash  you listened to the opponents of the Scottish Government \u0026ndash for thinking that Nicola Sturgeon is the witch from Hansel and Gretel, ready to eat any child who passes her cottage at Bute House made of social democratic gingerbread.  Whether you support those policies or not \u0026ndash and I personally do support those policies as a voter and a parent \u0026ndash the portrayal of the SNP as a party pushing some Stalinist family-crushing plot is clearly bonkers, and those peddling such nonsense know it\u0026rsquos bonkers. But these days, it is often the crazy not the considerate who win the day.  I spoke to John Swinney, the Education Secretary and Deputy First Minister, last week about a growing opposition to free tuition fees by senior university executives. He made it clear that he saw everything to do with the welfare and education of children on a continuum from baby boxes to free university education.  It was all about \u0026ldquovalues, he said \u0026ndash about everyone in society chipping in with taxes to pay for education, and about the state putting out a message that every child, especially the poorest, are cared for, and matter.  Now, of course, you could dismiss Mr Swinney\u0026rsquos comments as political spin \u0026ndash but, I think, he\u0026rsquos telling the truth. Actions speak louder than words, and those policies listed above \u0026ndash the Named Person, baby boxes, the smacking ban, free tuition, national testing \u0026ndash are all saying the same thing to the electorate: we are trying to do the best by your kids. Trying does not mean succeeding, but at least they\u0026rsquore trying.  There\u0026rsquos plenty I disagree with the SNP about, but when it comes to the broad spectrum of policies intended to improve the lives of children, I believe it has the best intentions at heart. And it is trying its best because at the heart of our education system lies a very real problem that the party has to take responsibility for: the struggle to close the attainment gap between children from middle class backgrounds and those from low income homes.  Disadvantaged pupils achieve around half the qualications that the most affluent achieve \u0026ndash that is a failure, especially for a social democratic party.  The opponents of the SNP, chiefly led by the Tories, picked up the attainment problem as a cudgel, and, rightly, beat the SNP over the head with it. As a result, the SNP, rightly, tried to enact policies to close the attainment gap, including national testing \u0026hellip which the Tories supported, but now don\u0026rsquot support, because, like always, what the Tories care about is power and point-scoring not policies which help the worse off in society.  Let\u0026rsquos concentrate, however, on testing in primary schools \u0026ndash intended, obviously, to help monitor failings in attainment so they can be addressed as early as possible. We\u0026rsquore told that the tests are \u0026ldquotraumatising children \u0026ndash especially those in Primary One.  This is embarrassing nonsense. I know plenty of teachers \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquom married to one \u0026ndash and not a single teacher I\u0026rsquove spoken to thinks the tests are traumatising. In fact, they laugh when they hear that. They may not like the tests, they may think they\u0026rsquore pointless, that it adds to an already huge workload \u0026ndash but trauma? Come off it, they say.  Children don\u0026rsquot have to prepare for the tests. The tests are done on iPads so it doesn\u0026rsquot feel like some scary pen and paper assessment. The tests are also \u0026ldquoadaptive which means that  the child is having trouble answering questions then it becomes easier, and  the child is doing well the questions become harder. The tests don\u0026rsquot last long - in P1 it\u0026rsquoll take no longer that 30 minutes once a year.  Some teachers feel the \u0026ldquomumsnet brigade \u0026ndash sharp-elbowed middle-class parents who want to wrap their children in cotton wool \u0026ndash hate the tests because it means their little princes and princesses might not come out with gold stars and A-pluses. What horror \u0026ndash their child might be average.  There are also concerns that it\u0026rsquos these parents who are creating the climate of fear around the tests: tell your child something is scary and the child will find it scary allow the child to do the test without inculcating fear and they\u0026rsquoll see nothing to fear.  So it is within a climate of hypocrisy, fear and falsehood that we are now to see a debate and vote on national testing in primary one, orchestrated by the Tories, which the SNP, according to political insiders, is likely to lose. The Tories have created enough chaos  to block a policy they supported until it became political convenient not to.

A chance to do something meaningful in schools when it comes to the education of children will likely be snuffed out.  If there\u0026rsquos any kind of fairy tale metaphor here, it isn\u0026rsquot wicked witch Sturgeon coming to gobble up your children, it\u0026rsquos the Pinocchio-nosed Tory party snatching hope away from children who need it, and locking up opportunity in a high tower that only the wealthy have the keys to, not the poorest."},{"url":null,"title":"minister-to-be-quizzed-on-45m-loan-to-sturgeon-advisers-firm","story":"  The Scottish Tories have tabled an urgent question about the taxpayer funds - some given in secret - going to Ferguson Marine Engineering, the last commercial shipyard on the Clyde.

The Tory-dominated cross-party group said this was compared to 1.8% of GDP in a worst case Brexit that forced the UK to rely on WTO rules.  The SNP said the \u0026lsquoWin Win\u0026rsquo report on the benefits of the UK, released to coincide with the fourth anniversary of the No vote in 2014 referendum, was \u0026ldquoludicrously over the top.  Scottish Business UK was set up last year as a vehicle for pro-Union businesses in the event of a second independence referendum.  Its founder and chairman is millionaire Tory donor Robert Kilgour and its chief executive is former Scottish Tory MEP Struan Stevenson.  Mr Kilgour said the question mark over another independence vote was deterring business investment in Scotland and hurting the economy.  He said: \u0026ldquoOur report shows that a second referendum on independence for Scotland will be eight times more damaging than a worse case Brexit scenario to the Scottish economy, and that is a reality that no-one operating in businesses across Scotland could afford to come to fruition.  Mr Stevenson added: \u0026ldquoWe are four years from the last referendum on independence for Scotland which was not supported, yet the spectre of a further referendum remains ever present.  \"We\u0026rsquore calling on the Scottish Government to abandon the demand for another referendum and focus more on reigniting the Scottish economy, so we once again become a credible investment opportunity, on a par with other parts of the UK.  Labour Jackie Baillie MSP said: \u0026ldquoThis is yet more evidence of how damaging independence would be to our economy.  \"As the SNP itself admitted in its cuts commission, independence would mean decades of austerity, tax rises and massive reductions in public spending.  \"That is not what the people of Scotland need or want.  \"Nicola Sturgeon needs to stop putting nationalism before the NHS, schools and jobs.\"  An SNP spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThese claims are so ludicrously over the top they show just how rattled the Tories are - they know support for independence has never been so consistently high or sustained, and that Brexit may well be the point of no .  ?\"Leaving the EU and a single market eight times bigger than the UK\u0027s alone threatens to be disastrous for Scotland - and the shambolic no-deal outcome the Tories are now preparing for would be utterly catastrophic.  ?\"Scotland is already one of the most productive parts of the UK outside London, with resources few countries can match, and independence would allow us to make the most of that huge potential.\""},{"url":null,"title":"cbi-joins-criticism-of-scottish-business-rates-levy","story":"  The CBI said plans to let councils levy a new charge on out-of-town stores and online retailer warehouses, such as those of Amazon, would deter investment and damage the economy.  The organisation, whose members employ 500,000 Scots, also said the levy would not work as a \u0026ldquounilateral measure in the global drive to tax the digital economy more effectively.  The out-of-town supplement, which is due to be piloted from 2020, is part of a suite of reforms to the business rates system instigated by last year\u0026rsquos Barclay Review.  The CBI welcomed a series of other measures in the Barclay Review, including more reliefs for new businesses, three-year revaluations, and greater transparency.  However it was scathing about the out-of-town levy, which the Barclay Review said should be \"modest\", set by inidual councils and used to help support struggling town centres.  The Scottish Retail Consortium has also strongly criticised the idea.  Calling for the plan to be abandoned, the CBI said the extra charge would hit a cross section of employers, such as garden centres, supermarkets and car dealerships, many of them already paying a separate supplement linked to their large size.  In a submission to the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos consultation on the out-of-town charge, the CBI said: \u0026ldquoThe issue of taxation in the new digital economy is being debated across the world\u0026rsquos developed economies with the OECD , the EU and the UK government attempting to find multilateral and unilateral solutions for how to tax global online business.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish government will not be able to unilaterally address such complex issues by giving local councils the ability to impose an additional levy.  \u0026ldquoWhat an additional levy would do is hit a range of local businesses across Scotland that are doing their best to contribute to their local economies.  It said  ministers went ahead with the plan, there should be a range of safeguards including a \u0026ldquostatutory cap, clarity on how the money would be spent, and consultation with business.  CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said: \u0026ldquoBusiness rates have been a bone of contention for far too long. While the Scottish Government should be applauded for taking action to remedy the situation, there\u0026rsquos still some way to go to build a regime that fits the Barclay Review\u0026rsquos goal of supporting business growth and long-term investment.  \u0026ldquoWhile we\u0026rsquore very sympathetic to the plight of high streets up and down the country, clobbering vital employers with a triple tax whammy is not the solution \u0026ndash instead we need smart, creative and sustainable proposals that revive local communities through increased economic activity. The idea for an out-of-town levy is a non-starter and the proposal should be scrapped immediately.  The Scottish Retail Consortium has called the out-of-town surcharge \u0026ldquoill-considered and poorly timed, and would add to the complexity of an already complicated system.  The Chartered Institute of Taxation said the levy should help the rates regime better reflect local priorities but was likely to be a \u0026ldquobureaucratic burden for already stretched councils.  A Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the consultation we launched in June, we are now seeking views on allowing up to three local councils to introduce pilot schemes in which businesses based predominantly online or out-of-town might be charged a modest business rates supplement.  \u0026ldquoThe proceeds from this supplement would be used to support rates relief for businesses in town centres and we are consulting on a range of appropriate safeguards, such as the need for consultation with all rate-payers who might potentially be affected.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that the consultation is as wide-ranging as possible and we would encourage all those with concerns or comments about the current business rates system to take part."},{"url":null,"title":"conference-sketch-corbyns-pants-mays-rubbish-and-the-lib-dems-wonderful","story":"  It could only be the Gospel according to St Nick.

Prof Clegg insisted he disagreed with Jo Swinson - never a wise move - who had cast doubt on some of the decisions of the Age of Stability that was the Lib-Con coalition.  St Nick puffed out his chest and insisted he was \u0026ldquoproud of his record in government, including \u0026ldquomassively reining in some of the darker Tory excesses.  Talking of which, he touched on his old Etonian chum that fallen Tory angel Dave. Whatever happened to him?  Cleggy, noting kindly how the thing the head Cameroon would be \u0026ldquoremembered for forever was calling that referendum, argued Dave was a \u0026ldquovery bad Conservative Prime Minister, much worse than when he led the Coalition, at which, St Nick admitted, he was adept.  Savouring the idea, Calamity pointed out that when his Tory chum finally achieved a majority government to lead in 2015, \u0026ldquoit all went utterly pear-shaped.  St Nick suggested the Tory brethren were now worshipping at the \u0026ldquotheological altar of Brexit, refusing to recognise the damage their dark religion would do the economy.  \u0026ldquoHistory will judge Theresa May very, very badly because she has allowed herself to become captive to that theological push.

On Thursday, she will discuss it with fellow EU leaders over dinner at an informal summit in Salzburg.  The PM said: \"I believe we\u0027ll get a good deal we\u0027ll bring that back from the EU negotiations, put that to Parliament. The alternative to that will be not having a deal because a I don\u0027t think the negotiations will have that deal, and b we\u0027re leaving on March 29 2019.\"  But Sir Nick accused her of presenting Britain with a \"con trick\" choice on Brexit between \u0026ldquomy fudge or the abyss. He insisted: \u0026ldquoWe always have more choices  only we are prepared to take them.  Ian Blackford, the SNP\u0026rsquos Westminster leader, was equally aghast at Mrs May\u0026rsquos ultimatum.  \u0026ldquoIt would be utterly unforgivable to impose this reckless false choice. Theresa May must ditch her hard Brexit plans and get behind the SNP\u0027s compromise proposal to stay in the single market before it is too late,\" declared the Highland MP.  His Nationalist colleague, Michael Russell, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Constitutional Relations Secretary, will today warn that Mrs May is leading the UK into a \u0026ldquochaotic blind Brexit with no clarity on the country\u0026rsquos future.  \u0026ldquoIt is misleading and the height of arrogance for the Prime Minister to say the only alternative to no-deal is the Tories\u0026rsquo flawed and unworkable Chequers Plan, which even they don\u0026rsquot agree on.  \u0026ldquoThe EU has been clear that the key economic planks of the Chequers Plan are not acceptable. That means there\u0026rsquos a growing danger that we are heading for a chaotic blind Brexit in which Scotland is dragged out of the EU with key questions on trade and the future relationship undecided and in the hands of hard-line anti-Europeans, he added.  This morning, the Commons Brexit Committee issued a report urging the PM to consider alternatives to her Chequers blueprint, which kept Britain aligned to Brussels to avoid a \"chaotic and damaging\" no-deal Brexit  her plan were rejected. Three committee members \u0026ndash Tories Jacob Rees-Mogg and Andrea Jenkyns and the DUP\u0026rsquos Sammy Wilson refused to endorse it.  The report came after the International Monetary Fund said all likely Brexit scenarios would \"entail costs for the UK economy\" but that a disorderly departure could lead to \"a signicantly worse outcome\".  Chancellor Philip Hammond also warned a no-deal would jeopardise the entire economic recovery since the 2008 financial crash.  Earlier, No 10 slapped down Boris Johnson after he again used his Daily  column to attack the Chequers Plan, saying under it Britain was \"heading full throttle for the ditch with a total write-off of Brexit\".

Part of the reason for that is that childbirth, in all its bone-wrenching, bloody glory, just is traumatic, but part is that I, as an educated 30-something, was so utterly unprepared for what would happen to me.  Sure, I\u0026rsquod seen One Born Every Minute and listened to a candid friend\u0026rsquos memory of being \u0026ldquoaxed in half in the delivery room, but ultimately I must have been influenced by the dominant narrative around childbirth that always ends with the mother, hair and make-up intact, sitting up in bed \u0026ldquodoing just fine while looking lovingly at her progeny. To say that the reality came as a shock would be the understatement of the decade.  It is obviously impossible for me to say whether being better informed pre-birth would have made the actual experience any better for me, but the aversion to telling women the truth about childbirth \u0026ndash or at least to empowering women to tell their own truths about giving birth \u0026ndash is nonetheless troubling.  That there is an aversion was highlighted last week when a speech given at the British Science Festival by a Hull University lecturer received widespread media coverage. Having been asked to investigate tocophobia \u0026ndash an unreasonable dread of childbirth \u0026ndash by her local NHS, Catriona Jones said she had found that by using websites like Mumsnet to share their experiences of how traumatic childbirth can be, women are contributing to a climate of fear that is negatively impacting on other women.  \u0026ldquoIf you go online and you go into any of the Mumsnet forums there are women telling their stories of childbirth, and it was terrible, it was a bloodbath, and that can be quite frightening for women to engage with, she was widely quoted as saying.  This was seized on by the media, which to some extent demonised Mumsnet and the women who share their experiences on it. The problem is, that while these reports accurately reflected Ms Jones\u0026rsquos words, they failed to tell the whole story, with just one newspaper \u0026ndash The  \u0026ndash noting that she had also warned that cuts to antenatal services were resulting in women being less prepared for childbirth than they used to be.  \u0026ldquoPreviously, that article paraphrased Ms Jones as saying, \u0026ldquowomen would be shown around delivery rooms in the weeks before the birth but most maternity wards are now too busy.  But  the real story is that an overstretched and underfunded health service is failing to prepare women for childbirth, and that in turn is compounding their negative experience of birth, why did the narrative around the research universally become one of women terrying other women, creating an added burden for the NHS in the process? Why are we so keen to cast women as problematic rather than acknowledging they have valid stories to tell?  The obvious answer is that a media controlled by men at best fails to recognise, and at worst seeks to distort or ignore, narratives that have women and women\u0026rsquos experiences at their core. As at least some of the reports on Ms Jones\u0026rsquos comments were written by women, though, the truth is more troubling even than that, with a deep-seated societal refusal to hear women\u0026rsquos voices likely to blame.  Indeed, as has long been highlighted by the classicist Mary Beard \u0026ndash a scholar who endures endless misogynistic abuse because she tells the stories of the women airbrushed from history \u0026ndash even in the earliest written evidence of western culture \u0026ldquowomen\u0026rsquos voices are not being heard in the public sphere.  Yet the importance of hearing those voices cannot be overstated. While the unconditional support of my partner and wider family were crucial for my post-partum recovery, there is no way I\u0026rsquod have been able to come to terms with the birth experience, or get through the waking, the feeding, the worrying \u0026ndash the endless, endless worrying \u0026ndash without the company of complete strangers who at that very moment were going through exactly the same thing as me.  It was thanks to the many, many hours spent reading Mumsnet threads on everything from induction and labour to lochia and tongue-tie that I realised that everything I had just experienced was totally normal and I wasn\u0026rsquot someone for whom things had gone badly wrong. The psychological impact of that was profound.  Far from silencing women\u0026rsquos voices and ignoring the stories that have shaped their experience for centuries, we should be doing more to ensure those stories are heard. Only then can the actual cause of problems such as tocophobia be addressed and the horric can become less horrying. Websites like Mumsnet, which give women the opportunity to finally share their experiences in a public forum, are part of that solution."},{"url":null,"title":"theatre-review-benidorm-live-playhouse-edinburgh-four-stars","story":"  Benidorm Live  The Playhouse, Edinburgh  Neil Cooper, four stars  The sun looks like setting on the Solana Hotel at the start of Derren Litten\u0026rsquos end-of-the-pier adaptation of his phenomenally successful Brits-abroad sitcom.

The SNP said devolving migration was vital to counter the UK government\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquohostile \u0026lsquoLittle Britain approach to the issue and to Brexit.  In a long-awaited report on European migration, the MAC said there should be no special preference given to EU workers coming to the UK after Brexit.  It also said there was no evidence that increased EU migration had damaged le in the UK.  It concluded that EU migrants paid more in tax than they took in benefits, contributed more to the NHS workforce than the healthcare they accessed, and had no effect on crime rates.  It called on the UK government to make it easier for high-skilled workers to migrate to the UK, and called for no limit to the number of highly-skilled workers allowed in each year.  This is currently capped at 20,700 from non-EU countries.  Despite the SNP arguing for Holyrood to control migration to offset the impact of Brexit, the MAC report said it was not necessary.  It did not opine on whether migration should be devolved or stay reserved - saying that was a political decision - but it did say there was no underlying economic need for it.  It said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government take the view that EU migration to Scotland is essential for preventing a  to population decline, to offset the ageing of the existing population and to support remote communities.  \u0026ldquoAlthough lower migration might lead to population decline, this problem is not something that starts at the Scottish border, some Northern English regions have similar prospects.  \u0026ldquoMigration is much less effective at dealing with a rising old age dependency ratio than increases in the pension age and immigration may not be an effective strategy for sustaining remote communities unless the reasons for locals leaving are addressed.  \u0026ldquoOverall, we were not of the view that Scotland\u0026rsquos economic situation is sufficiently dferent from that of the rest of the UK to justy a very dferent migration policy.  Tory MSP Adam Tomkins said politically-driven SNP demands for devolved migration were \u0026ldquoentirely unnecessaryand potentially damaging.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe report identies that Scotland\u0026rsquos demographic needs are similar to the rest of the UK and might not be best solved by immigration alone. The fact that a separate Scottish immigration policy may also require a border at Berwick is simply another reason why the SNP must abandon their policy for a separate immigration policy.  Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie added: \u0026ldquoScotland faces the twin challenges of an ageing population and key worker shortages. But these problems are not unique to us.  \u0026ldquoAreas of England, Wales and Northern Ireland share our population trends and need for agricultural workers, NHS and social care staff. \"This debate needs to be fought UK wide. Cutting ourselves off and looking at this issue in isolation isn\u0026rsquot the smartest way to solve it.  Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons Home Affairs select committee, said the report was \u0026ldquovery puzzling, with \u0026ldquosignicant gapsin its analysis and recommendations.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe MAC admit they have ignored the crucial relationship between immigration and trade, and explicitly made no recommendation on whether immigration should be part of the [Brexit] negotiations. This report still leaves a serious gap in the evidence base.  Scottish Chambers of Commerce boss Liz Cameron said employers would welcome an end to the cap on high-skilled migrants, but would dislike the idea of more charges for them.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt seems counter-intuitive to create further barriers to skilled migration. Any future scheme must provide a streamlined experience for both migrants and firms, while relentlessly seeking to remove bureaucracy and red tape.  Mike Cherry of the Federation of Small Businesses also said the MAC report was a concern, as some of its plans would add to the costs and administrative burden on employers.  SNP migration minister Ben Macpherson told MSPs the report was deeply disappointing.  He said: \u0026ldquoWith all of our population increase to come from migration over the next 25 years, migration is absolutely critical to Scotland\u0026rsquos future prosperity.  \u0026ldquoHowever the MAC report does little to consider Scotland\u0026rsquos needs and instead suggests that increasing the pension age would be a preferential approach to managing demographic change \u0026ndash a completely unsustainable position and one we would reject.  \u0026ldquoThis report will also be deeply disappointing to businesses and employers across Scotland who asked for a simple, low cost approach to migration which took into account the requirements of their sectors."},{"url":null,"title":"korean-leaders-meet-in-pyongyang-for-potentially-tough-talks","story":"  Mr Kim gave the South Korean president an exceedingly warm welcome, meeting him and his we at Pyongyang\u0027s airport - itself a very unusual gesture - then riding into town with Mr Moon in an open limousine through streets lined with crowds of North Koreans, who cheered and waved the flag of their country and a blue-and-white flag that symbolises Korean unity.

The statements adds: \"It was also made clear that whilst changes to the scale would be welcomed, recruitment and retention of all teachers needed to be improved and all should receive a 10 per ent pay rise, in addition to any other changes.\"  The moves comes after headteachers described the offer as \u0027cynical and isive\u0027.  The Greens backed the move with education spokesman Ross Greer saying: \"Unions are right to take a stand on teacher pay.  \"It\u0026nbspis misleading for Cosla and the Scottish Government to present this as some kind of unprecedented pay rise when those who would benefit the most will still only make up half the value their wage has lost over the last decade. Many will benefit far less than that.\"  At its AGM in June the Educational Institue of Scotland teaching union voted in favour of escalating to \"strike readiness\" and preparing for a ballot after the summer holidays unless a deal achieving the 10 per cent was reached.

A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"Teachers\u0027 pay is a matter for the SNCT and negotiations for 2018-19 are continuing.\"  Cosla has urged unions to accept a \u0026pound350 million pay deal for local government workers, warning any increase above the three per cent on offer for those earning up to \u0026pound80,000 would result in cuts to jobs and services.  They said the offer \"highlights our commitment to parity across the local government workforce\".

This compares with children who are ed to their families, who spend an average of nine months away from home.  Academics at the university, and at the Universities of York and Lancaster, tracked the progress children aged under five, who had been taken into care in 2012-13. Of 1,836 children covered by the study, 481 wer looked after at home with their parents, supervised by social work. Meanwhile 1,355 were placed with family members, foster carers or prospective adoptive parents.  After four years, of those removed from home, 31 per cent had been ed to their parents\u0027 care, 11 per cent were living permanently with relatives and 16 per cent had been adopted, while six per cent were in the process of adoption.  A further 32 per cent continued to be looked after away from home.  Lead academic Dr Helen Whincup, from the University of Stirling, said: \u0026ldquoWhat this tells us is that when the child is going home, this happens relatively quickly. However, despite the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos explicit commitment to early permanence, other routes to secure a child\u0026rsquos care take much longer, even for our youngest children.  \u0026ldquoFor those children where adoption is the most appropriate option, there is no evidence that this decision is taken hastily in Scotland.  \"In fact, the data shows rather the opposite it takes approximately two to three years, even for those children who became looked after when they were very young.  Looking at decision-making in the Children\u0027s Hearings System, researchers found a spike in the number of children who stopped being looked after at home just on or before the 12 month limit for a new decision to be made.  Dr Whincup said this was concerning as it indicated decisions were being taken to meet a schedule or according to other priorities, rather than basing them on the needs of the child. Researchers now aim to track the children\u0026rsquos progress into adolescence and beyond."},{"url":null,"title":"article-50-author-says-second-vote-on-brexit-is-viable","story":"  Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, who as Secretary General of the European Convention wrote Article 50, said the UK Government\u0026rsquos letter triggering the withdrawal process could be withdrawn and  Westminster willed it, there were \u0026ldquomultiple routes to holding another referendum on Britain\u0026rsquos future.  The Scottish peer\u0026rsquos comments - set to be ridiculed by the pro-Brexit factions and rejected by Theresa May\u0026rsquos Government - came after Sir Vince Cable told the Liberal Democrat conference that Brexit was \u0026ldquonot inevitable and urged Labour to dump Jeremy Corbyn  the Leader of the Opposition did not \u0026ldquofight Brexit and back a People\u0026rsquos Vote.  And last night, in a potentially signicant development, Michel Barnier made clear the EU was ready to come forward with an \"improved\" proposal on the Irish border \"backstop\" to reassure the British it would not lead to the creation of a frontier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.  Declaring how Brussels wanted to respect the constitutional integrity of the Union, the EU27\u0026rsquos chief negotiator said: \"We are attempting to improve our proposals. What we are talking about here is not a border - not a land border, not a sea border it is a set of technical checks and controls.\"  Mr Barnier also told a news conference in Brussels the European Council on October 18/19 would be the \u0026ldquomoment of truth when it would become clear whether or not the two sides could agree a Brexit deal.  \"It is then we shall see  agreement we are hoping for is in our grasp,\" he declared.  His comments came as the Prime Minister prepares for tonight\u0026rsquos dinner at an informal EU summit in Salzburg, where she will seek to get support for her Chequers Plan from fellow European leaders.  She is expected to warn them in clear terms that rejection of her compromise proposals by MPs would lead to a damaging no-deal.  In a further sign of Mrs May\u0027s attempts to build support for the Chequers Plan, she met Manfred Weber, leader of the EPP - the main centre-right group in the European Parliament - in Downing Street on Tuesday.  A No 10 spokesman said: \"On Brexit, Weber recognised the Chequers proposals were a step forward and stressed the priority the European Parliament placed on resolving questions relating to the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland as well as to maintaining the integrity of the single market.  Speaking ahead of the Salzburg summit, Lord Callanan, the Brexit minister, said Britain had shown flexibility and now it was time for Brussels to \u0026ldquoreciprocate.  \"If we are to get a deal there has to be compromises from both sides, he insisted.  Elsewhere, UK police chiefs agreed that the policing response to Brexit should be delivered at a UK level, including dealing with any civil disruption in the wake of withdrawal, while recognising Scotland\u0027s \"distinct constitutional arrangements\".  Humza Yousaf, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Justice Secretary, said while he commended Police Scotland\u0027s offer of mutual assistance to other forces, the decision was a \u0026ldquostark reminder of the hugely damaging impact Brexit could have on our security capabilities.  The Roadmap to A People\u0026rsquos Vote, written by Lord Kerr, states: \u0026ldquoThere would be no dficulty obtaining an extension of the Article 50 timetable to allow a People\u0027s Vote to take place. If Parliament judged that it was necessary to delay the March 29 deadline so that it could consult the people in a democratic vote, the Government would not face any political or procedural obstacle to this.  It adds: \u0026ldquoIf there is a deal, the most pressing question for the country would be whether that deal is better than the one we already have inside the EU. And  there is no deal, the country deserves the right to say whether it nevertheless still wants Brexit.  The crossbench peer said: \u0026ldquoThe die is not irrevocably cast, there is still time and, until the UK has left the EU, the Article 50 letter can be withdrawn.  \u0026ldquoIf there is a majority in Parliament for a People\u0026rsquos Vote, there are multiple routes to securing one and, as the process unfolds, more opportunities for the House of Commons to assert its will may emerge.  \u0026ldquoShould the UK need more time for a People\u0026rsquos Vote, there is little doubt that the other 27 member states would agree the necessary extension of the Article 50 timetable, added Lord Kerr.  \u0026ldquoHistory will not be kind to any politician who hides behind purely logistical arguments, legalese or arcane parliamentary procedure to deny people a vote on the outcome of these Brexit negotiations at such a fragile and crucial moment for our country, he added."},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-brexit-dominated-lib-dem-conference-as-vince-cable-waved-goodbye","story":"  The party leader used his farewell keynote speech to insist leaving the EU was \u0026ldquonot inevitable and that it could be reversed  the momentum for a People\u0026rsquos Vote continued to gather pace.

They, claimed the Lib Dem chief, had turned from \u0026ldquobroad churches into intolerant cults.  Which, of course, has left the fourth force in Westminster politics with a golden opportunity.  Yet despite the fact that loyal lieutenants were stressing how the party had doubled its appeal, from 7.4 per cent at the last election to 11 per cent-plus now - actually, a recent poll put the Lib Dems on just six per cent - the yellow peril is not picking up support anywhere near where it should be.  Sir Nick Clegg branded Jeremy Corbyn and Labour \u0026ldquopants, while he dismissed Theresa May and the Tories as \u0026ldquorubbish. Yet,  this is true, then the Lib Dem surge should be happening. But it isn\u0026rsquot.  This is undoubtedly why Vince wants change but saying you want to create a \u0026ldquomovement of the moderates hardly gets the political pulse racing. Many Lib Dems insisted they were not moderates but radicals. And then there is the plan to open up a future leadership contest to non-MPs.  A ripple of expectation rose among the yellow T-shirts when the campaigning businesswoman Gina Miller gave a conference speech but swtly burst the bubble of expectation about her own ambitions when she told delegates that she was not their leader-in-waiting.  In his keynote address, Sir Vince urged Labour and Tory rebels to have the courage to leave and, by implication, join the Lib Dems. No names were mentioned but that of Labour\u0026rsquos Chukka Umunna has been on the lips of some delegates in a positive and a negative way.  And he sought to pile pressure on Jeremy Corbyn over the People\u0026rsquos Vote issue by telling the Labour comrades that  their leader does not back the second poll, then they should dump him.  But  the Lib Dems are to capitalise on the anti-Brexit sentiment, then they need an energetic, charismatic leader, who doesn\u0026rsquot fluff his lines, to lead the charge to keep Britain in the EU as soon as possible.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classication of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in  Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo  only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked  they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has over 200 translators making their bilingual books available in languages traditional publishes ignore such as English Igbo in Nigeria, German/Tigrinya in Ethiopia and now English/Norn in Scotland.Copies of both the workbooks and storybooks are available at John O\u0026rsquoGroats and Caithness Horizons.\u0026nbspWednesday 19 Sep 2018 2:37

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot...

Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to le and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that ides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because  nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Wednesday 19 Sep 2018 2:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Wednesday 19 Sep 2018 2:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of le make le-changing decisions that create a dference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the y cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it. We had always seen Marcus as he was at rugby \u0026ndash a strong, witty and kind gentleman. After talking with more team-mates who have opened up and described their own experiences the horrying statistics become relatable.The cycling trio hope to be arriving at Land\u0026rsquos End in a fortnight\u0026rsquos time and are hoping to raise \u0026pound2000 for the Marcus in Mind fundraiser set up by his family.To make a donation, visit the website on: justgiving/crowdfunding/for-marcusWednesday 19 Sep 2018 2:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September 18, 2018 at 4:14 pmOrkney Ferries has confirmed that the MV Earl Thorfinn is now fully operational, following the repair of its bow thruster.

It has also fired up my passion to bring about a real change and a radical rebalancing of power in the Scottish economy.            That’s why I was pleased to read two eagerly awaited reports on the future of the economy just published. The Institute for Public Policy Research’s  distinguished Commission on Economic Justice provides a radical and visionary plan for delivering change in a post-Brexit economy and the David Hume Institute’s  “Scotland’s Productivity Challenge” stimulates debate around a very practical agenda for change.            They complement and reinforce each other. Both reports serve as useful reminders of the importance of clarity in debate. The DHI report begins as it means to go on, “A country’s productivity is the single most important determinant of its average living standards and wealth.” The IPPR make a similar point “poor productivity ... holds back growth and holds down wages”.And both recognise the importance of long termism. So, the IPPR’s Commission notes that “the economy needs fundamental reform”, as the “weaknesses in productivity, investment and trade go back 30 years or more. They will not be addressed by incremental change or trying to ‘muddle through’.”This is refreshing. The challenges we face are deep-seated and they demand a new radicalism and vitality.There have, after all, been far-reaching changes to our economic structure over the last three decades. We have shted from being a nation of producers to being one of consumers. We have witnessed a continued contraction of manufacturing jobs and the total collapse of entire industries like mining.We have seen the emergence of a service-led economy and a consequent impact on our balance of trade and our national accounts, but also at a human level on working lives and the sustainability of local communities too.              : Richard Leonard: Mediocre SNP too timid to stand up to Tory austerityAnd we have seen a transformational loss of economic and industrial ownership and control from Scotland which has strained and broken accountability in our economy even further.Telling in the reports is an analysis that despite a high level of skills in the workforce and favourable terms of trade – we sell exports at relatively high prices compared to the imports we buy – our labour productivity and our labour force is being let down because we have low capital stock, that is we have low levels of business investment in machinery and equipment.Intriguingly, the IPPR conclude that low capital investment is exacerbated by the growth of the low-wage, precarious employment economic model. Business owners getting caught up in a downward business spiral of low pay, low investment, and low productivity.            Productivity in simple terms is measured as GDP per hour worked. The long hours culture is one of the reasons why both productivity and the quality of le is dragged down.One suggestion to tackle this is better parental leave entitlement and more holidays. I would not argue with this. But it is also long overdue that we revisit the UK opt-out of the European Union Working Time Directive, which means in Scotland alone more than a quarter of a million workers regularly work beyond a 48-hour week. We need to break away from this long hours’ culture, not only for the sake of our productivity, but also for the sake of our health, and health and safety.The answer to the productivity challenge and many other industrial questions from the political right is iniably tax cuts. But there is a sleight of hand here.Whilst the Tories have cut corporation tax from 26 pence to 19 pence, they have put up regressive taxes like VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent – hitting the poorest the hardest. So, there has been a redistribution of income and wealth, but just in the wrong direction.: Richard Leonard: How public money is used to exploit Scottish workers            Moreover, both reports eschew this tax-cutting agenda. The IPPR concludes “there is in fact little evidence that investment levels are signicantly influenced by corporation tax rates” – pointing to much higher rates in much more successful economies. The DHI’s finding is that the answer to Scotland’s productivity challenge is not to be found in tax cuts, but business research and development, investment in a stronger indigenous business base and better management.And they make clear that the Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance, including education, health, housing, planning, transport and economic development.At the start of this year, the Scottish Government published its assessment of Brexit’s effect on Scotland. Productivity was singled out as the largest factor in the reduction in our GDP, expected to contribute a 5.8 per cent drop in economic output.And there is little doubt that Brexit should inject some added urgency to tackle the long-term problem of Scotland’s productivity gap. It only serves to reinforce this need for a step change in how we do things. If we do not make this change in the context of Brexit, we will simply drt even further from the high-skill, high-wage economy Scotland needs. Increasing the level of productivity is key to achieving sustainable economic development, to raising incomes and to creating better quality jobs. Scotland is one of the better performing parts of the UK by measure of productivity, but it is still below the UK average. Much of the debate in the Scottish Parliament is regularly focused on what powers the current Government does not have rather than the ones that it does.The Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance. It is high time that at long last they were used.After all, the questions we now face are far too important to be left to economists alone to answer, and they certainly cannot be left to the present parties of government. If we are to bring about the real economic change we need, we will need to change our political priorities too.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4801443.1537253498!/image/image.jpg","title":"independence eight times more damaging than brexit unionists say","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Independence would be eight times as costly to the Scottish economy as Brexit, campaigners against a second independence referendum have warned on the fourth anniversary of Scotland\u0026#8217s decision on its constitutional future.                Scottish Business UK, a cross-party campaign set up to represent pro-business Unionist voices, warned that the damage to trade with the rest of the UK would outstrip losses from exiting the European single market under the government’s Brexit plans, and said employers would struggle under the weight of added uncertainty.            In a report published today entitled ‘Win-Win: the business case for Scotland’s place in the UK’, campaigners claim that Scottish independence would be eight times as costly as the Scottish Government’s worst Brexit forecasts, because Scotland would lose the additional government spending per head under the Barnett Formula.            The report also highlights figures showing trade between Scotland the rest of the UK is worth three times as much to the Scottish economy as trade with the EU. The SNP called the warning “ludicrous”.Scottish Business UK founder Robert Kilgour, an investor and former care home operator, said: “Scottish businesses and the economy has gone through an extended period of uncertainty and that is destabilising our opportunity to grow and crucially to secure inward investment.“The negative impact of the continuing uncertainty is a message I hear regularly from investors who turn to other countries or regions in England, to give their investments a more stable base from which to grow.”Former Conservative MEP Struan Stevenson, the campaign group’s chief executive, added: “We are four years from the last referendum on independence for Scotland which was not supported, yet the spectre of a further referendum remains ever present. “We’re calling on the Scottish Government to abandon the demand for another referendum and focus more on reigniting the Scottish economy, so we once again become a credible investment opportunity, on a par with other parts of the UK.”            Scottish Labour’s Economy spokesperson Jackie Baillie MSP said: “This is yet more evidence of how damaging independence would be to our economy. As the SNP itself admitted in its cuts commission, independence would mean decades of austerity, tax rises and massive reductions in public spending.“Nicola Sturgeon needs to stop putting nationalism before the NHS, schools and jobs. She should drop her plans for an unwanted second independence referendum and instead try and start fixing the mess she has made of the economy and our schools and hospitals.”An SNP spokesperson described the claims as “ludicrously over the top”.“They show just how rattled the Tories are – they know support for independence has never been so consistently high or sustained, and that Brexit may well be the point of no ,” the spokesperson said.            “Leaving the EU and a single market eight times bigger than the UK’s alone threatens to be disastrous for Scotland – and the shambolic no-deal outcome the Tories are now preparing for would be utterly catastrophic.”Meanwhile, Scotland’s minister in charge of Brexit negotiations has warned of the growing risk the UK will be forced into a “chaotic, blind Brexit”.Constitution Secretary Mike Russell accused Theresa May of “misleading” voters on the prospects for her Chequers plan, claiming EU leaders have already dismissed the UK government’s proposals.And he claimed politicians south of the Border had failed to meet their pledge that Scotland would be an “equal partner”  it stayed in the Union.Mr Russell said the Prime Minister must use a summit of EU leaders in Salzburg this week to “rule out both a ‘blind’ and a No-deal Brexit”.            Speaking ahead of an address to business leaders and academics in Edinburgh, Mr Russell said: “Four years ago today, the people of Scotland voted on our nation’s future and were then told we were to be treated as equal partners in the UK – absolutely nothing that has happened since has lived up to that pledge, with Brexit making it clearer by the day that Westminster is incapable of working in Scotland’s national interests.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4801419.1537213811!/image/image.jpg","title":"paris gourtsoyannis don t think mps won t do the unthinkable","story":"        Ten years ago this month, the collapse of Lehman Brothers transformed our world.                There was a foretaste in the UK with the run on Northern Rock, but it was the US investment giant’s fall in 2008 that heralded the start of the Great Recession.            We’re still working out the ways that moment cascaded through all our lives. The impact could be so great as to be measured demographically – studies suggest there are 4.8 million fewer children in the United States, with the economic crisis forcing young people to put off the decision to have a family - sometimes indefinitely.            In purely economic terms, too, the effects are still being felt: those aged between 30 and 39 earned on average £2,000 less per year between 2008 and 2017.And then there are the effects that are less easy to measure: a generation  that feels less secure and is less confident that the world can provide a path for them - but more determined, perhaps, to find their own way.The most interesting analyses of the ten-year milestone have been the ones that have gone back to that moment, to see how it was reported and commented on at the time.One such exercise reminded me of a detail that offers a worthwhile lesson among all the other lessons, not about our economy and society, but our politics.In September 2008, in the teeth of the crisis, when it looked as  global financial institutions would topple like dominoes, the US congress actually voted against President Bush’s initial proposal for a 700bn bailout of the nine biggest American banks.            A single vote wiped 1.2tn off the value of the world stock market, in an hour. For good and for ill, the scheme was eventually revised and passed, but for a while, at least, politicians were pushed by fear of their constituents to step off the edge into the unknown.There is an assumption that MPs would never vote down the Brexit deal Theresa May brings back from Brussels, whatever it is, because the alternative is so stark.The tenth anniversary of Lehman’s collapse is a reminder that politicians are quite capable of creating the conditions for disaster - and of doing the unthinkable in response.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4801503.1537259243!/image/image.jpg","title":"storm ali new storm set to blast scotland a day after helene","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4801889.1537303141!/image/image.jpg","title":"westminster report scotland specific immigration system not justified","story":"        Demands from the SNP for Scotland to be given control of migration powers are not justied, a major report on European immigration to the UK has found.                A UK-government commissioned report has ruled Scotland’s economic situation did not justy having a migration policy dferent to the rest of the UK.            The Migration Advisory Committee’s  study of immigration under EU free movement rules said Scotland’s economy did not need a “very dferent” migration regime to meet its labour requirements. The report said any changes by devolved administrations would be a “political decision”, not economic.            • : 64 per cent of Scots want immigration powers devolved to HolyroodScottish ministers say Scotland’s historic trend of population decline, particularly in rural areas, means some control over migration should be passed to Holyrood – a demand the UK government has resisted.The SNP said the document was “deeply disappointing”.The MAC report was also drawn into a separate row over its recommendation that citizens from European Economic Area  countries should lose the preferential treatment they enjoy under free movement rules, despite acknowledging that post-Brexit trade talks with the EU would likely involve discussion of special immigration status. • : Vince Cable tells Labour to ditch Jeremy Corbyn and moderate MPs to quit            Business leaders also expressed disappointment the landmark report, which will have a major influence on the UK government’s migration policy after Brexit, recommended a series of new barriers for EEA migrants, warning it could lead to labour shortages and harm the economy.The MAC study, considered the most comprehensive, evidence-based look at UK migration policy in recent years, found EU free movement hasn’t had a major impact on employment levels or wages in the UK. It concluded that EEA migration had “neither the large negative effects claimed by some, nor the benefits claimed by others”.The report also said  “immigration is not to be part of the negotiations with the EU and the UK is deciding its migration system in isolation, we recommend moving to a system in which all immigration is managed with no preferential access to EU citizens”.Other recommendations include scrapping the cap on Tier 2 skilled work visas and having no specic migration route for low-skilled work, with the possible exception of a seasonal agricultural workers’ scheme.            • : Preferential immigration rules for EU citizens should end, report saysScottish migration minister Ben Macpherson said: “With all of our population increase to come from migration over the next 25 years, migration is absolutely critical to Scotland’s future prosperity.“However, the MAC report does little to consider Scotland’s needs and instead suggests that increasing the pension age would be a preferential approach to managing demographic change – a completely unsustainable position and one which we and many across Scotland would reject.“This report will also be deeply disappointing to businesses and employers across Scotland who asked for a simple, low-cost approach to migration, which took into account the requirements of their sectors.”He said the report’s proposals “completely ignore” sectors such as tourism, agriculture and forestry and “fails to address their major concerns about current and future access to workforce”.            Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins said: “The SNP’s call for immigration to be devolved is therefore entirely unnecessary and could actually be detrimental.”He called on the SNP to abandon calls for a separate immigration policy, saying it could require a “border at Berwick”.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the immigration debate should be “fought UK-wide” and warned against “cutting ourselves off and looking at this issue in isolation”.Nick Marston, chairman of British Summer Fruits, reacted angrily to comments in the MAC report stating the UK berry industry was “small, low wage and low productivity in the wider UK context” and should not use a new seasonal workers’ scheme “to avoid the need for higher productivity” through greater use of technology. “Without access to seasonal workers ... our successful berry industry will cease to exist,” Mr Marston said.The British Chambers of Commerce said the MAC’s recommendations “are unlikely to meet the needs of all employers” and warned “any sudden cut-off of EEA skills and labour would be concerning,  not disastrous, for firms across a wide range of regions and sectors”. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development warned many UK employers would face “signicant challenges” in accessing skills and labour.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion.

A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country.

A phone call from Brydon Thomason to Alastair Wilson, the Scottish Natural Heritage warden, alerted folk to them heading north off Westing, which triggered a mega sprint across to the coast where they were able to look down on about four animals including a male.\nTo be able to see them close to is a memorable experience, but to be able to look down on them underwater even more amazing. Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.\nFrom photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the 12th July, is a big male known as 014 or “Bigga”.  Next day, the same inidual was identied at 0800hrs heading north through Yell Sound.\nSome of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.\nCommon heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.\nChanging colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.\nFrom the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first. Maybe its powers of protection will rub off on you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with 14 women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday.\n issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notied by letter.\nWednesday 19 Sep 2018 2:39 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117295.jpg","title":"Lack of 999 cover for busy Harley weekend","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nAVIEMORE was covered by only a single-manned ambulance for most of the Harley Davidson Thunder in the Glens rally, it has emerged.\nIt means that a casualty could be attended to but not taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the event of an emergency until a second ambulance crew had arrived at the scene.\nIt is understood the village only had an ambulance with single crew rather than double crew available last Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday until 5pm.\nThere were an estimated 3000 motorcyclists in the area for the UK\u0027s biggest Harley rally.\nGMB Scotland also said Kingussie only had a single manned crew in operation from just after midnight on Thursday until Sunday morning.\nThe union said the situation is simply not acceptable and poses a real danger.\nAlong with the Strathy, the GMB has been calling for the Scottish Ambulance Service to get rid of the current on-call system and to replace it with 24/7 shts to bring the Aviemore base into line with most other stations in Scotland.\nJohn Marr, GMB branch secretary, said: \"Only a first responder service would have been able to be provided by an ambulance with single crew.\n\"This would have involved looking after the casualty at the location until back up arrived.\n\"We think it is dangerous and we are stepping up our calls on the government to provide the Scottish Ambulance Service with the funds required to give Badenoch and Strathspey the service the area deserves.\n\"At the moment we are going round in circles asking why there is no 24/7 cover despite Aviemore being one of the busiest tourism spots in the whole of Scotland.\n\"We have repeatedly informed the Scottish Ambulance Service that this is a dangerous situation but nothing is happening.\"\nHighland Council convener and local councillor Bill Lobban, said: \"The current level of ambulance cover is clearly completely unacceptable.\n\"Given our population added to the huge number of visitors we see on a daily basis the Scottish Ambulance Service needs to make sure we have sufficient staff on duty to provide a safe and effective service.

there are proposals to designate more land for economic use at Granish just north of the village.\nLand for industrial use has been regarded as being in short supply within the Aviemore area for many years.\nThe park authority is also looking to re-allocate the existing protected open space at Spaven Drive at the north end of Aviemore for community use.\nThe site has been identied by Aviemore Community Enterprise Company as a possible location for a new community hall with a kick park and playground.\nThe blueprint for the Landmark attraction is to expand the site to the west and south which would accommodate increased parking and future expansion of the business.\nLand to the north-east of Grantown\u0027s caravan park has been pinpointed for possible development.\nThe CNPA is required to publish a LDP for the park which must be reviewed every five years.\nBetween November 2017 and March this year the MIR \u0026ndash which outlined the CNPA\u0027s views on the key issues

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government.

There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold.

We are elected as MPs who vote for Sinn Féin not to take seats at Westminster.”\nMeanwhile, a poll by LucidTalk in June 2017 showed that 87% of Sinn Féin voters backed their abstentionist stance, with only 5% opposed.  \nWhen supporters were asked how they would react  Sinn Féin judged that it strategically suited the party to take seats in Westminster, more than half of their supporters  said they would oppose such a move.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27475  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nWe believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like.  - Matt Carthy MEP\nSinn Féin will host a United Ireland conference in Letterkenny tomorrow featuring a range of speakers discussing what Irish unity would look like and how it can be achieved. \nThe Towards A United Ireland conference will be hosted by Matt Carthy MEP and will be held in the An Grianan Theatre in Letterkenny from 11am tomorrow. \nIt will feature two panel discussions with contributors discussing whether an agreed Ireland is possible and  a unity referendum could be won. \nPanellists will include journalist and unionist commentator, Alex Kane, economist Paul Gosling, founder of Equate, Michael Barron, Jonathan Shafi from the Scottish independence movement, commentator Patricia MacBride and Gillian Hamill, journalist and homelessness campaigner. \nThe panel discussions will be chaired by Damien Dowds, editor of the Inishowen Independent. \nSpeakers from Sinn Féin will include Elisha McCallion MP, Martina Anderson MEP, Pearse Doherty TD, Matt Carthy MEP and Senator Padraig MacLochlainn. \nIt is the fth in a series of Towards A United Ireland conferences to be held recently. \nSpeaking ahead of the event, Matt Carthy encouraged as many people as possible to attend. \n\"We believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like. \n\"As part of this process Sinn Féin has organised a series of successful conferences on this theme in Dublin, Belfast, Cork and London. \n\"The event will give a range of perspectives on whether a new Ireland is possible and whether or not we can win a referendum on Irish unity. \n\"This is an important discussion and there is a place for everyone in it so I would encourage as many people as possible to come along and join us in Letterkenny,\" he said. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27476  ","story":" Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nBrexit means that change in the political relations between Britain and Ireland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democratic legitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.- Declan Kearney\nTheannual British-Irish Association  conference convened last weekend inOxford, England.\nAt thesame time the British government was taking its latest step away from the Good FridayAgreement by changing legislation on calling elections in the north, the DUPleader pulled out from attending the BIA conference at the last minute to hostthe Tory defence minister at another DUP gala dinner in Fermanagh.\nOnWednesday, speaking after meeting the British Prime Minister in London sheprovided the latest evidence that the DUP has no commitment to restoring thepolitical institutions.  \nTheBrexit catastrophe is unfolding relentlessly.\nTheTory party civil war has become even more visceral since the Chequersannouncement.\nThe RHIinquiry continues to reveal a DUP party which was clearly dysal ingovernment, providing insights which make a mockery of that party\u0027s purportedadherence to \u0027good governance’.\nIanPaisley\u0027s misconduct \u0026amp discredited behaviour arising from the Sri Lankaepisode is yet another reminder of the recurring financial scandals associatedwith the DUP.\nThe DUPjust does not get it!\n\nThatparty has been in turmoil since it walked away from the draft agreement andaccommodation with Sinn Féin on 9th February which would have restoreding political institutions by the following week.\nYet inall these circumstances the DUP feels no pressure to change its position.\nAndeven  the British government was so inclined, the Tories have no incentive todo so in the midst of their own governmental and party crises.\nInreality some within the DUP have turned away from the political institutions.\nThey have already decided the party should notcontest the 2019 local council elections against the back ground of anagreement on Acht Gaeilge and Irish language rights. It\u0027s increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.\nLastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.\nThefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.\nTheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.\nIn myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that 25years of progress could be squandered.\nIrepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.\nThefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.\n\nAnd thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.\nThereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.\nSinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.\nPartitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.\nIt hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. \nThesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.\nTheCivil Rights Movement 50 years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since 1998. \nTherefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast 18 months.\nThegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.\nThey wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.\nThe politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.\nOver 20 years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.\n\nVerysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.\nA newgeneration is questioning partition.\nTherepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.\nBrexithas become a defining moment for these islands.\nIthas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.\nThedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.\nThesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.\nTheydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.\nThereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.\nNegativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.\nInitially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.\nFormany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.\nForthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.\nHowever, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.\nIt istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.\nIn parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity.\n Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.\n\nA GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.\nTheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.\nPoliticalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. \nToomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.\nSocietalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.\nDemographicshts in the north are irreversible.\nIt isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.\nSomevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.\nThiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.\nTheopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.\nSinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.\nButfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.\nWhocould have imagined 30 years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.\n\nThemodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.\nMandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”\nIrishunity is both reasonable and achievable.\nIrelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.\nWe arestronger as a people for that.\nSinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.\nThereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.\nThis isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

It is produced when fuels such as gas, oil, coal and wood don’t fully burn. Household appliances that are powered by such fuels include boilers, gas fires, central heating systems, water heaters, cookers and open fires.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nBreathing in carbon monoxide can make you unwell and,  you are exposed to high levels, can kill. Symptoms of carbon monoxide aren’t always obvious, particularly at low-level exposure. The most common symptoms include a tension-type headache dizziness nausea and vomiting tiredness and confusion stomach pain and shortness of breath and dficulty breathing.\n\nEnsure your home or student accommodation has a working carbon monoxide alarm in rooms where a fuel burning appliance is located and test the alarm regularly. If you have a gas appliance, make sure to ask your landlord for a gas safety certicate to show that it has been serviced annually.\n\nSmoke alarms should be installed on every level in student homes and should be tested weekly. Be aware of the dangers of phone chargers. Counterfeit phone chargers can be deadly as they are often made with poor quality components that fail to meet UK safety regulations. Always use the charger supplied with the phone. Never leave your phone to charge overnight as it can potentially cause a fire due to overheating.\n\nAlways remember to lock doors and close windows when leaving the house, even  it is only for a few minutes.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor information or advice contact Environmental Health on 0300 0300

high pupils hailed for exam successes","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n\n                \nPrincipal Ian McConaghy hailed the students and said their achievements, particularly at A Level, were down to a team effort.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAddresssing the class of 2018, he said: “To our leavers and year 14 pupils, this recognition of achievement is our chance to put you in the spotlight and say ‘well done’,‘congratulations’ and ‘best wishes’ for the next stage of your lives, to all of you.  It is right and fitting that your families join us for this occasion since achieving success in education and particularly at A level, is indeed a team effort”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the examination results Mr McConaghy continued “The results this year are excellent 87% of all the grades achieved were A*-C and all subjects were passed with no fails at all. These results are a tremendous credit to everyone involved and reflect highly on the sixth from provision here in Dromore High.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“There are so many success stories I could mention, but for tremendous achievements I would highlight Zara Malcolmson and Charles Wright our top two pupils with 3 A* and 3A grades between them, but in truth I could carry on down the list to include many, many more all of whom worked really hard and succeeded. As per our ethos we value the achievements of every single pupil who has done their best, worked hard and succeeded”.\n\nMr McConaghy had a special welcome for retired teacher Miss Hazel Uprichard, a member of the Senior Leadership Team and Head of Science who retired in August after 33 years of dedicated service and loyalty to Dromore High, wishing her well for her retirement.\n\nCommenting on the make up of the school’s sixth form Mr McConaghy said “a considerable number of pupils join our sixth form from other schools.These pupils are an extremely welcome addition to our sixth form transferring typically from Rathfriland High School, and other schools in the locality. These pupils settled in Dromore High extremely well and they brought some new perspectives and a fresh balance to the sixth form.  \n\n“We are delighted they chose to study here and their results are an affirmation of their choice. Two of them were chosen as Head Prefects, Deputy Head Girl Zara Malcolmson and Deputy Head Boy David Whiteside.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReviewing the leavers destinations,’ Mr McConaghy indicated that approximately 20% of them were going to the UK mainland to continue their third level studies with the majority choosing to go to local universities. He said degree courses being undertaken in Accounting, Agriculture, Archaeology, Business, Biomedical Science, Communication, Economics Education, Engineering, Geography, Human Nutrition, IT, International relations and politics, Law, Mathematics, Nursing, Pharmacy, Psychology and Sport.\n\nMr McConaghy added: “Six of our pupils have secured Higher Level Apprenticeships in Accounting, Mechanical Engineering and Luke Edgar secured an IT apprenticeship with worldwide multinational firm Google. He takes up his position in London this month”.\n\nHe paid tribute to the staff for their commitment in curricular and extra-curricular activities, mentioning in particular the very broad and beneficial Enrichment programme for sixth form pupils which helps prepare them for the next stage of their career. All of this helps us as we seek to continue to educate our students to look upon themselves as global, rather than as parochial, citizens, and be able to assess risk, analyse world affairs intelligently and adapt accordingly. \n\n“Additionally, into year 13 this year we have admitted almost 100 pupils which again is a most encouraging intake and a vote of confidence by the local community and those from further afield in our sixth form”.  \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the disappointing lack of political progress in Northern Ireland, Mr McConaghy nonetheless offered his thanks to several local politicians for their ongoing support for the school “away from the spotlight”, in particular Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who “continues to advocate strongly on our behalf concerning our critical need for a new school building and the lack of places for pupils in year 8”. Mr McConaghy urged a strengthening of political support for the needs of the school at this critical time. \n\n“It is said that ‘self-praise is no recommendation’ however I feel it is my duty to heap praise on my staff and all those involved in educating this group of leavers. This school and it’s staff does a magnicent job and I offer as evidence to support that claim this tremendous group of young adults who are a credit to themselves, their families and this school.\n\n“Finally I would say to our leavers group, we don’t wish this to be your last event with your school. Join our alumni group being set up this year by Mrs Mitchell and keep in touch. Even though your formal education here is now complete we can be of assistance to each other. Be proud of this school wherever you study and wherever you ultimately find yourselves. We remain here to help should you ever need help in any way. My sincerest best wishes to you all.”\n\nGuest speaker Miss Claire Beckett BSc reflected on her time in Dromore High which she had enjoyed tremendously. Claire had always faced the challenge of combining a love of study with a love of farming. \n\nVery early morning starts to complete her work on the family farm near Donaghcloney preceded her busy days in school before ing to the farm for more work. Claire had enjoyed both aspects of her le tremendously. Early in le she knew that she wanted to work with animals and identied a gap in the knowledge of effective nutrition for cattle. Her education had prepared her for this and she was now pursuing this through her career with her employer Trouw Nutrition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nClaire advised the pupils to commit to the highest levels of study now even  they did not have a final destination in mind at this stage.\n\nIt was important to balance all one’s endeavours in le and realise that sometimes some things have to be sacriced for long term benefit, even  it is dficult at the time. Her advice was to “work hard at whatever is right in front of you at the time”.\n\nClaire had been influenced by a number of people in her le to good effect including her family and her teachers and she paid tribute to them. Reiterating wise words given to her that “ you enjoy your job you never work a day in your le”. She urged the pupils to work hard and pursue their dreams that they may enjoy their careers also.\n\nDuring the celebration, two musical items provided entertainment for the audience, a vocal solo by Sophie Tate accompanied by her grandfather Mr Donald McClernan on acoustic guitar, ‘Song Bird’ and a piano solo by Erin McNally entitled ‘A Steady Hand’\n\nChairman Mrs Woods thanked Claire for her inspirational speech and for presenting the certicates, prizes and cups to the recipients. Mrs Woods concluded the celebration by reiterating her pride in the pupils and the school “wishing all the pupils well on the next stage of their journey” wherever it was leading them.\n\nSEE NEXT

many women are being left traumatised by these implants","story":"\nA Banbridge woman who suffered 12 years of pain after having a vaginal mesh implant fitted is leading the fight for a moratorium on the use of the devices in Northern Ireland.\n\n                \nDrawing on her own painful experience, Jackie Harvey has set up an online support group to offer help and advice to local women about mesh implants, and raise awareness about the complications associated with them.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nJackie Harvey.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe implants are used by surgeons in an operation to treat pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence, which can be common after childbirth. But following reports of many women being left in agonising pain, there have been calls for the procedure to be banned, or at least suspended until the long-term safety of the implants can be evaluated.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAt the age of 36, a gynaecologist recommended that Jackie have a vaginal mesh implant fitted as a way of alleviating the urinary incontinence problem she’d been left with after having her second child.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn March 2005 she underwent surgery and it worked well. She recovered quickly, but unfortunately the plastic implant soon started to cause her problems.\n\n“After a year or two I noticed the tops of my legs were getting really painful and stf and I just thought I must be getting old, though I was only 38 at the time,” she explained.\n\n“I went to doctors ious times about the pain in my legs and got x-rays, but they didn’t really show anything. In 2009 I stopped doing any sort of impact exercise. I couldn’t run. I couldn’t really walk very far without getting pain in my legs, my feet and hips. I kept going back to the doctor and nothing was showing. In 2013 I was really struggling and I went to rheumatologist who told me that I didn’t have arthritis. I went to an orthopaedic consultant who told me he couldn’t see anything wrong with me. And then by 2015 I had seen an article online where a woman called Kath Sansom had started a campaign group called ‘Sling The Mesh’ and she was suffering from very similar complications to me, and it was just like a lightbulb going off in my head - this was 10 years after I’d had it put in.”\n\nJackie, who claims she wasn’t told about the risks so couldn’t make an informed decision about getting the implant, says the pain she suffered as a result of the device ruined 12 years of her le.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It had a really detrimental impact on my le. I was struggling to walk and I was in pain and exhausted every single day of my le. I felt about 90. I was stf, sore and I just felt ill. For me to go to a doctor and my issues not to be recognised or accepted was just horrendous.” \n\nJackie was referred to a gynaecologist who told her the implant wasn’t causing her problems, but she refused to accept that was the case. She decided she had no other option but to challenge the doctor’s findings, and eventually had to pay for specialist treatment in England.\n\nThe 49-year-old office worker had a scan in London which showed that her implant was in the wrong place and was causing her pain. She finally underwent surgery at a hospital in Oxford in March this year to have her mesh removed.\n\n“As soon as I woke up the dference was amazing,” she said. “I’m still not perfect, but I’m an awful lot better than I was.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThrough the UK-wide ‘Sling The Mesh’ group, Jackie heard many stories of women from Northern Ireland who are suffering similar problems to those she experienced. So, in a bid to help them, she decided to set up her own local support group on Facebook, and it already has around 200 members.\n\n“This is a repeated story across the UK, not just in Northern Ireland,” she continued. “These ladies are going to their surgeons and they are being told ‘It’s not the mesh that’s causing your problems’, or ‘It’s all in your head’. It’s almost like they’re reading off a script.\n\n“These women are in pain, some of them are constantly getting infections, others are on antibiotics every day.\n\n“Their lives are a misery, they have no sex lives, their marriages have broken down, some have lost their jobs, they can’t enjoy their le, it’s just horrendous. That’s what spurred me on to push for some sort of recognition that there is an issue in Northern Ireland and something has to be done.”\n\nWhile the NHS says “the majority of women treated with mesh respond well to the treatment”, it acknowledges that “the Medicines \u0026amp Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  has received reports of complications associated with vaginal meshes - mostly regarding persistent pain, sexual problems, mesh exposure through vaginal tissues and occasionally injury to nearby organs, such as the bladder or bowel.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nJackie, who was the first woman to report her implant to the Northern Ireland Adverse Incident Centre at Stormont, is campaigning for the use of vaginal mesh implants to be suspended.\n\n“In Scotland there was a moratorium put on the use of mesh in 2014, by the Scottish government, and it doesn’t make sense that in the rest of the UK women aren’t afforded the same protection,” she said.\n\n“We want the use of mesh suspended whilst there is a review ongoing. We want the same protection that they have in Scotland. We also want a national register to register how many mesh complications there actually are.\n\n“So many women are being left traumatised by this. They are going to doctors for help and are just basically being fobbed off. It’s appalling. I hear the same story day in, day out from women looking for help and there’s nobody there to help them. Where do these women go for help? They are being left on the scrapheap and that’s just heartbreaking.”\n\nJackie is urging women who need help and advice about vaginal mesh implants to contact her via her Facebook page ‘TVT POP Mesh Problems N Ireland’ or by email: meshgirlni@icloud\n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8632687.1537268642!/image/image.jpg","title":"ufu welcomes speed limit at local schools","story":"\nThe Department for Infrastructure has introduced a new part-time speed limit of 20 mph outside seven rural primary schools including Bronte Primary School, Ballynaskeagh Road, Banbridge.\n\n                \nIntroduced last Tuesday, the new legislation will reduce the National Speed Limit to 20 mph for a short time at the start and end of the school day when pupils are arriving in the morning and leaving school in the afternoon.

It is not some form of charity or a handout, it is a right for all those who need it.”\n\nJohn says he is aware that his friend’s predicament is not an isolated case and so he feels it is time that some form of independent review was instigated to ascertain just how many people who were in receipt of DLA have been refused PIP, and also  awarded PIP, how many were given a lower rate of benefit than before.  \n\nHe said: “My friend only discovered that the medical professional approved an award of PIP for her only for another unknown inidual to intervene and essentially overrule the medical professional’s decision by submitting a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 for copies of all papers associated with claim for PIP.  \n\n“Had she not done this then, presumably like many others, she may have just let it go as an appeal is not only time consuming, but also extremely stressful.”\n\nPeople Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said: “Once again we have another person applying for PIP who has been failed by the system. \n\nThe criteria for PIP is already strict and made extremely dficult for people to obtain. However the fact that this applicant initially met the criteria which was then overturned is very worrying. How many other people have been placed in this situation?\n\n“This latest case is a further example of how medical evidence is not prioritised when assessing people\u0026#8217s disability. We have heard time and again how medical evidence was not asked for in PIP cases. \n\nThis latest case once again proves how the system is not fit for purpose. It needs a complete overhaul and we need a welfare system that doesn’t punish those who are entitled to benefits.” \n\nA Department for Communities spokesperson said: “All PIP assessment reports go through a quality checking regime designed to ensure that decisions on entitlement, taken by the Department are correct. At times this may lead to an initial report being amended with the points increased or decreased. The checking process provides assurance that any approach to assessment is consistent so that customers with conditions that have the same al effect will ultimately receive the same benefit outcome. \n\n“Anyone who doesn’t agree with Department’s decision, can ask for it to be reviewed and provide any additional information. \n\n“There is then also the opportunity to appeal to an Independent Tribunal. Measures are currently in place to support people who are financially worse off following reassessment from DLA to PIP whilst they appeal to the Independent Tribunal.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"punks of belfast unite as good vibrations sets out its stall at the lyric","story":"\n\nBRIGHT\n red tartan and oxblood Dr Martens filed into the Lyric Theatre on Sunday as a packed auditorium took their seats for Good Vibrations.\nThe story of Terri Hooley and Belfast punk, based on the 2014 Bafta-nominated film, makes a seamless transition from stage to screen as we learn how one man decided he just wanted to open a record shop on ‘the most bombed half-mile in Europe’, play his music, smoke a few splfs and get local music heard.\nShameless star Aaron McCusker swaggers on to the stage portraying Terri “with an i”, all open-necked shirt, bottle green pullover, overcoat and flares. Despite the Troubles shutting down parts of the city, he is determined to play his headline slot in the Harp Bar even  it means playing to an audience of one. It’s here that Terri meets his we Ruth, played by West End star Niamh Perry, and the two try to build their le together, as Terri becomes distracted – all too easily – by trying to passionately promote the latest band to come on the punk scene as he turns promoter for Rudi and The Outcasts.\nIf anyone during Sunday’s afternoon matinee was expecting a leisurely retrospective they were in for a rude awakening as this is a gloriously full-on production of music and song with all-star cast in full, fine voice, all playing instruments and giving it the heap.\nEvery audience member is with our protagonist as he goes across the water, copious copies of seven-inch vinyl under his arm as he tries, most of the time in vain, to try and get snooty English music executives to listen to a band from Derry called The Undertones and their debut song Teenage Kicks – a song so iconic that John Peel did the unthinkable and played it twice on Radio One.\nWith every high comes the inevitable low and we witness how Terri releases the band from the Good Vibrations label for “£500 and a signed copy of a Shangri-Las record”.\nWith a marriage falling apart, mounting debts at the record shop and next to no revenue, a fundraising concert at the Ulster Hall sets the scene for the rousing finale and our lead’s poignant rendition of Sonny Bono’s Laugh At Me.\nA standing ovation gave way to the ‘national anthem’ as the raw opening bars of Teenage Kicks started up and the audience sang every line back to the cast.\nGood Vibrations is a must-see – simple as that. The amount of energy fizzing off the stage is infectious and the cast of ten are exceptional. A transfer to the West End must surely follow.\n\n\nGood Vibrations runs at the Lyric Theatre until Saturday, October 6.

Work on the EU side is ongoing.\n\n“We are clarying which goods arriving in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would need to be checked and where, when and by whom these checks could be performed,” he said.\n\n“We can also clary that most checks can take place away from the border at the company premises or in the markets. We need to de-dramatise the checks that are needed.”\n\nHe reminded the British, however, that the checks were the result of their decision to leave not only the EU but also the single market and the customs union.\n\n“What we need in the withdrawal agreement is a legally operational backstop which fulls respects the territorial integrity of the UK.\n\n“It is a backstop that will only apply unless a better solution is found,” he said.\n\nHis comments came as EU leaders prepare to gather in Salzburg on Wednesday for an informal summit – the first time they have met together since Mrs May published her Chequers blueprint for Brexit in July.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab has urged the EU to make compromises \n\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister is expected to brief the other 27 leaders on proposals over dinner and they will then have a separate discussion on Thursday after she has left.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said it was time for the “compromises” made by the UK to be “matched on the EU side”.\n\nIn an interview with European newspapers, he said that there had to be movement on the Irish border issue.\n\n“What I’m not going to do is to say that I would refuse to entertain any further proposals that the EU comes up with but they’ve got to be respecting the equities that we’ve set out,” he said.\n\nWhile Mr Barnier highlighted the October summit as the “moment of truth”, European Council president Donald Tusk confirmed that a further summit could be held in November to finalise an agreement.\n\nIn a letter to EU leaders ahead of the Salzburg meeting, he said he wanted to avoid the “catastrophe” of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nHe said the meeting should also reconfirm the need for a “legally operational backstop” on Ireland to avoid a hard border.\n\nMr Tusk, who will chair the talks, also urged the leaders to work on “limiting the damage” caused by the UK’s withdrawal.\n\n“Unfortunately, a no-deal scenario is still quite possible. But  we all act responsibly, we can avoid a catastrophe,” he said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Today [Tuesday] we want to provide an update on our plans.\n\n\"It is our intention to be back up and trading again as soon possible. As you can appreciate, we are at the early stages on this and will confirm details as soon as possible. We hope that this will assist the on-going efforts to drive footfall into the city centre.\"\n\nThe spokesperson also asserted it was committed to reestablishing a shop presence in Belfast.\n\nBelfast City council Council welcomed the announcement Primark would donate to the wider City Recovery Investment Fund.\n\n“Primark is very keen to support small businesses in the city centre – in particular those that have been severely impacted by the fire.  The company has asked Belfast City Council to distribute this funding on its behalf,\" a Council spokesperson said.\n\n“Belfast City Council is developing a City Recovery Investment Programme which includes immediate, medium and longer term proposals to support businesses, re-establish and sustain high levels of trading the city centre in the lead up to Christmas and beyond, increase connectivity across the city centre, ultimately ensuring the city’s economic resilience.\n\n\"The contribution made by Primark will be an important part of that overall programme delivery.\"\n\nIn a statement, Belfast DUP MPs Nigel Dodds, Emma Little Pengelly and Gavin Robinson welcomed the donation.\n\nThey said: \"“Everyone is aware of the disruption that has been caused to Belfast City Centre as a result of the cordon in place around Bank Buildings. It is important that efforts continue to reduce that as quickly as possible and allow business to  to as much normality as possible.\n\n\"There are concerns about the impact of forecasted high winds over the next 24 hours and how this could affect the building. It is those risks which mean the safety cordon has to be kept in place, but we hope that progress can be made quickly.\n\n\"The donation made by Primark to the City Council’s recovery programme is a very welcome goodwill gesture. Primark have demonstrated a strong commitment to Belfast since the fire and the donation recognises the impact upon many other smaller traders in the city centre.\"\n\nWe would encourage all those businesses to access the funding when it becomes available.”\n\nMore details of how affected businesses can access funding are expected to be released after a meeting on Friday.\n\nThe Belfast city centre Primark housed in the Bank Buildings was destroyed in a fire on Tuesday, August 28.\n\nSince the blaze a safety cordon has remained in place, blocking access to businesses inside the safety cordon.\n\nIt is still unclear how long the cordon will remain in place for and how long businesses will remain closed.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"storm ali set to sweep northern ireland with","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Instead, Longford councillors decided against nominating a candidate after only one hopeful showed up to address them.\n\nMr Casey is now the third Dragons’ Den entrepreneur along with Sean Gallagher and Gavin Duffy to run for president. However, he faces strong competition from the incumbent Michael D Higgins, who is currently leading the polls.\n\nSinn Fein unveiled Liadh Ni Riada as its candidate at the weekend.\n\nThe sixth candidate is mental health activist Senator Joan Freeman.\n\nMr Casey runs global recruitment firm Claddagh Resources. It operates from five locations across the world, including its European base in Buncrana, Co Donegal.

Work on the EU side is ongoing.\n\n“We are clarying which goods arriving in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would need to be checked and where, when and by whom these checks could be performed,” he said.\n\n“We can also clary that most checks can take place away from the border at the company premises or in the markets.\n\n“We need to de-dramatise the checks that are needed.”\n\nThere was no immediate response to his comments from either Downing Street or the Department for Exiting the EU, and it was unclear whether they would be sufficient to unlock the negotiations.\n\nA No 10 source said Mrs May will tell the other leaders in Salzburg that a “disorderly” Brexit can still be avoided with “good will and determination” on both sides.\n\nWhile she will say the UK will honour its commitment to ensure there is a “legally operative protocol” on the Irish border, it must preserve the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK, which the existing proposal does not.\n\n\nLimiting damage caused by \n#Brexit\n is a shared interest. Unfortunately, a no deal scenario is still quite possible. But  we all act responsibly, we can avoid a catastrophe. \n#SalzburgSummit18\n \nhttps:t.co/Xs2qaZwtYf\n\n— Donald Tusk  \nSeptember 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nIn his comments, Mr Barnier reminded the British that the whole issue of the border had arisen as a result of their decision to leave not only the EU but also the single market and the customs union.\n\n“What we need in withdrawal agreement is a legally operational backstop which fulls respects the territorial integrity of the UK. It is a backstop that will only apply unless a better solution is found,” he said.\n\nMr Barnier also made clear that time to reach a deal was running out with his comment that the October summit would be the “moment of truth”.\n\nAttention had been increasingly focused on the prospect of a special summit in November to finalise an agreement, however Mr Barnier said it should be clear before then whether a deal was actually possible.\n\nEuropean Council president Donald Tusk said EU leaders should discuss arrangements for the “final phase” of the Brexit talks “including the possibility of calling another European Council in November”.\n\nIn a letter to leaders ahead of the Salzburg meeting he called on them to work on “limiting the damage” caused by Brexit.\n\n“Unfortunately, a no-deal scenario is still quite possible. But  we all act responsibly, we can avoid a catastrophe,” he said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"who are the six candidates vying for irelands presidency","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Her first husband also died when she was in her 20s.\n\nIn the European Parliament, Ms Ni Riada has been a vocal advocate for the Irish fishing industry, and critical of the Common Fisheries Policy, arguing the Irish have not received their fair share of the fishing quota.\n\nBefore her political career, she served on the board tasked with setting up Ireland’s Irish language television channel, TG4. She also worked as a producer for state broadcaster RTE.\n\nShe ran her own production company for several years, and has been an advocate of theIrish language.\n\nMs Ni Riada currently lives in the Muskerry Gaeltacht, an Irish speaking area of Co Cork.\n\n\nMichael D Higgins:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Michael D Higgins during his speech to open the Irish 2018 National Ploughing Championship in Tullamore, Co Offaly, Ireland.\n\n\n\n\nThe sitting President, 77, was born in Limerick and had an academic career in the 1960s-70s, teaching sociology in Ireland and the United States.\n\nHe entered the political arena in the late 1960s, joining the Labour Party and served as a senator in the 1980s before representing Galway West in the Dail from 1987 to 2011.\n\nMr Higgins is a fluent Irish speaker and served as minister for arts, culture and the Gaeltacht in the 1990s.\n\nHe is also a published poet and has presented TV documentaries.\n\nMr Higgins was first elected president in 2011 after running as an independent candidate.\n\nHe made history in 2014 when he became the first Irish President to undertake an official state visit to the UK.\n\nEarlier this year, he welcomed Pope Francis to Ireland, the first papal visit in almost 40 years.\n\nAs the current president, Mr Higgins is able to nominate himself as an independent candidate for another seven years in office.\n\nHowever, he has secured the backing of Fine Gael, Fianna Fail and Labour, who have agreed not to field candidates from their own parties.\n\n\nSean Gallagher:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandout screengrab photo issued by Sean Gallagher of himself declaring his intention to run again in the upcoming presidential election.\n\n\n\n\nThe 56-year-old businessman and former Dragons’ Den star from Ballyhaise, County Cavan, finished second in the 2011 Irish presidential election.\n\nHe secured more than half a million first preference votes, but lost out to Mr Higgins.\n\nMr Gallagher has described himself as coming from the “Fianna Fail gene pool”, but is running as an independent.\n\nIn 2002 he co-founded Smarthomes, a home technology business.\n\nThe company won numerous awards for innovation, and Mr Gallagher was a finalist in the 2006 Ernst \u0026 Young Entrepreneur of the Year contest.\n\nMr Gallagher became a public figure during his time as an investor on RTE One’s Dragons’ Den from 2008 to 2011.\n\nLast year, State broadcaster RTE apologised to Mr Gallagher over a fake tweet read out during a live TV debate during the last election campaign.\n\nThe tweet, which accused Mr Gallagher of collecting funds for Fianna Fail, was purported to be from an official account linked to the late Martin McGuinness, who also ran for president in 2011.\n\nHowever, it later emerged the account was not the official campaign account of the Sinn Fein candidate. Mr Gallagher had been leading some opinion polls in the 2011 race prior to the tweet furore in the closing stages of the campaign.\n\nMr Gallagher won the backing of Roscommon, Mayo, Leitrim and Wexford councils, and was the first independent candidate to secure a nomination.\n\n\nGavin Duffy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIrish Presidential candidate Gavin Duffy pitches for nominations to members of Waterford Co Council.\n\n\n\n\nThe entrepreneur and businessman from Sallins, Co Kildare, is best known for his role on the RTE programme Dragons’ Den.\n\nMr Duffy, 58, started his career as a shareholder in radio stations, and in 1992 he co-founded a media and management consultancy.\n\nHe is the former owner of HRM, one of Ireland’s largest recruitment companies.\n\nHis early career in the media included presenting the first RTE television business programme, Marketplace broadcasting on Morning Ireland on RTE Radio One, and founding regional radio station LMFM.\n\nLater, Mr Duffy became a serial entrepreneur and is now a veteran of over 40 start-ups.\n\nHis venture capital portfolio has been concentrated on recruitment, professional development, education and media.\n\nHe has been a panellist on the Irish version of Dragons’ Den for all eight seasons since the show began in 2009.\n\nMr Duffy has worked in the past as an adviser to both Fine Gael and Fianna Fail.\n\nHe has said he would accept the full presidential salary of 350,000 euro.\n\nThe current President, Michael D Higgins, has voluntarily reduced his own salary to under 250,000 euro while in office.\n\nMr Duffy will run as an independent candidate after securing his nomination by winning the backing of Waterford, Meath, Carlow and Wicklow councils.\n\n\nJoan Freeman:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIrish Presidential candidate Senator Joan Freeman pitches for nominations to members of Waterford Co Council.\n\n\n\n\nThe independent member of the Irish Seanad is a psychologist and mental health activist from Dublin.\n\nSenator Freeman has served on the Seanad since May 2016 after being nominated by the then taoiseach Enda Kenny. She is the chairperson on the committee on mental health.\n\nThe 60-year-old founded Pieta House, a suicide intervention charity, in 2006 in Lucan, County Dublin. It now boasts 12 additional centres around Ireland.\n\nSenator Freeman also founded the annual fundraising event Darkness into Light in aid of Pieta House.\n\nThe event began with 400 participants in 2008 and has since grown with approximately 200,000 people participating in the 2018 events held across Ireland, including at the Phoenix Park.\n\nShe resigned from Pieta House in 2014, in order to concentrate on developing Solace House, a similar charity based in New York City launched in 2015.\n\nSenator Freeman will run as an independent candidate. She earned the backing of Galway City Council as well as Galway County, Fingal and Cork County councils.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may hosts fashion greats at downing street reception","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Nest mistook the Batman face on May’s T-shirt for a visitor, and not recognising it, took action. \n\n“When I saw the facial recognition, I laughed and showed my we, then posted it to Twitter and started working on some chores around the house, installing new shelves,” the 39-year-old web developer told the Press Association \n\n“A few hours later I looked at my phone and had many hundreds of notications.”\n\nIn subsequent tweets, May explained that the door had been unlocked because he and his family were at home and passing in and out. \n\nWith the door locked, he used a pin code to enter. Had the door been unlocked it wouldn’t have opened automatically. \n\n\nNo, the door will not unlock  it sees a friendly face. That\u0027s not a feature. It just reacts to an unknown face by locking the door just in case you forgot to lock it and a stranger approaches. It didn\u0027t recognize Batman.\n— B.J. May  \nSeptember 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nFor anyone super curious about the tech on display, here goes. \n\n\nThis is the Nest Hello paired with the Nest x Yale lock. I like it quite a lot. Yes, regular old keys are great. We just like the ability to remotely allow our kids into the house via the app without issuing them physical keys that can be lost/stolen.\n— B.J.

Francis’ role in Argentina’s most famous case of priestly sex abuse is coming under renewed scrutiny as he faces the greatest crisis of his papacy over the Catholic Church’s troubled legacy of cover-up and allegations he himself sided with the accused.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nFrancis, who at the time was still Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, in 2010 commissioned a four-volume, 2,000-plus page forensic study of the legal case against a convicted priest that concluded he was innocent, that his victims were lying and that the case never should have gone to trial.\n\nThe Argentinian church says that the study obtained by The Associated Press, bound volumes complete with reproductions of Johannes Vermeer paintings on the covers, was for internal church use only.\n\nBut the volumes purportedly ended up on the desks of some Argentine court justices who were ruling on the appeals of Father Julio Grassi.\n\nDespite the study, Argentina’s Supreme Court in March 2017 upheld the conviction and 15-year prison sentence against Grassi, a celebrity priest who ran homes for street children across Argentina.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nFather Julio Grassi stands in a courtroom \n\n\n\n\nThe study, and Francis’ role in the Grassi case, have taken on new relevance following allegations by a former Vatican ambassador that Francis, and a long line of Vatican officials before him, covered up the sexual misconduct of a prominent US cardinal.\n\nNeither Francis nor the Vatican has responded to the allegations that Francis rehabilitated ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick from sanctions in 2013.\n\nThe Vatican did not respond to a request for comment about Francis’ role in the Grassi case.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with AP, Grassi’s victim, Gabriel, said he is still waiting for Francis to acknowledge his pain, given the Supreme Court has now ruled that he indeed was assaulted by Grassi when he was 13.\n\n“I’d like for the church to say something, even though I don’t expect it will,” Gabriel said.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nGabriel, a sex abuse victim of Julio Grassi, holds one of four books written by Argentinian criminal defence lawyer Marcelo Sancinetti \n\n\n\n\n“No one ever reached out to me,” he said. “No one bothered.”\n\nFrancis, the former archbishop of Buenos Aires, was not Grassi’s bishop and bore no direct responsibility for him.\n\nBut in 2006, he was quoted by the now-defunct Argentinian magazine Veintitres as saying the accusations against Grassi were “informative viciousness against him, a condemnation by the media”.\n\nHe said he would withhold judgment pending the outcome of the court case, but Grassi himself gave evidence that Cardinal Bergoglio had “never let go of my hand” throughout the legal process.\n\nUnder Cardinal Bergoglio’s presidency, Argentina’s bishops conference in 2010 enlisted a leading Argentine criminal defence lawyer, Marcelo Sancinetti, to research a counter-inquiry into the prosecutors’ case against Gabriel and two other former residents of Grassi’s Happy Children homes whose cases were thrown out in the initial trial.\n\nIn the study, Mr Sancinetti concluded that not only were not the accusations against Grassi sufficiently proven, “the falsity of each one of the accusations is objectively veriable”.\n\nIn the four tomes, which were produced at an annual clip from 2010-2013, Mr Sancinetti accused Gabriel of changing his story and trying to extort Grassi.\n\nBut a court years earlier had already thrown out a criminal complaint filed by Grassi accusing Gabriel of extortion.\n\nMr Sancinetti compared the “current trials and condemnations with severe sentences based exclusively on the word of a person who calls itself victim of sexual abuse to the trials for witchcraft of the Middle Ages”.\n\n\n\nI suffered and continue to suffer\nGabriel, abuse victim\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in the final volume and on his law firm’s website, Mr Sancinetti said Francis in particular had commissioned the work.\n\nArgentina’s Supreme Court disagreed with Mr Sancinetti’s analysis, and on March 21 2017, upheld Grassi’s 2009 conviction for having sexually abused and corrupted Gabriel.\n\nThrough tears, Gabriel had given evidence that on two separate occasions in 1996 the priest once fondled him, and then performed oral sex on him in his office.\n\nGabriel, who for a time was placed in Argentina’s witness protection program after suffering a break-in, physical attacks and threats, said he was shocked when Grassi testied that Cardinal Bergoglio “had never let go of my hand.”\n\n“We were all like ‘wow!’ It was Bergoglio,” he said.\n\nGabriel said he and his lawyer delivered a letter addressed to Francis two months after he was elected Latin America’s first pope, bringing it to the Vatican embassy in Buenos Aires on May 8 2013.\n\nIn the letter, Gabriel identied himself as a victim of “aberrant crimes of repeated sexual abuse and corruption” by Grassi.\n\nHe lamented that court-protected details of his abuse had been exposed by the study, which he said had “denigrated” him personally and contradicted the stated “zero tolerance” policy of both Pope Benedict XVI and Francis.\n\n“I suffered and continue to suffer,” he wrote.\n\nHe asked for an audience with the pope “and I earnestly beg you for compassion and help in recovering my faith.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"council investing community

emerged.\n\nThe derelict lands at Meenan Square have for the last number of years been the source of anti-social behaviour in the area, having also been the site of a number of controversial bonfires.\n\nIn the wake of the most recent bonfire on August 15, which followed six nights of continuous rioting in the area, local councillors proposed that a number of solutions to address the problem, including the demolition of buildings, now be looked at.\n\nThe Urban Villages initiative had been planning to develop the site ‘for a range of purposes’ which would include a ‘community aspect’.\n\nOverseen by the Executive Office , the Urban Villages  initiative is designed to improve good relations outcomes and develop thriving places where there has been a history of deprivation and community tension.\n\nA representative from Urban Villages told the September meeting of the council’s Environment and Regeneration Committee that Apex Housing Ltd was lined up as their partner to deliver the project.\n\nHowever, the meeting was told that the site had been bought by an ‘unknown purchaser’.\n\nUrban Villages have asked the selling agent for contact with the inidual to ‘establish

The drainage work was completed recently, but the road is to be closed again between September 17 and 28 from 9am to 4.30pm daily.

Resurfacing work is also proposed but there is no confirmation when this will start.\n\nCllr Curran added: \u0026ldquoAll road improvement work across the district is welcome and roads officials deserve praise for their commitment to address routes which require investment.

Bredagh cruised to a 3-9 to 1-7 win over Annaclone and Saul upset the odds with a sensational 1-15 to 1-6 win over a fancied Ballymartin outfit in Newcastle.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe JFC semi-finals draw was also made on Monday night and sees Ardglass take on Teconnaught, with Aughlisnafin facing the winners of tonight\u0026rsquos replay between Kilclief and Aghaderg in Castlewellan.\n\nArdglass displayed a great tactical awareness to get the better of Dromara on a 2-7 to 0-11 scoreline at Drumaness on Saturday and Teconnaught beat St Paul\u0026rsquos 3-16 to 0-11 after they produced a storming second half performance.\n\nAughlisnafin, as expected, edged out Newry Mitchels 1-13 to 2-7 at a wet and windy Mayobridge on Monday night and they will most certainly fancy their chances against either Kilclief or Aghaderg. The six semi-finals will be played over the weekend of September 28-30.\n\nMeanwhile, Portaferry and Ballygalget lock horns on Saturday in a bid to join Ballycran in the Senior Hurling Championship decider.

While the move has been welcomed by the SDLP, it has been criticised by the DUP.\n\nThe current Strangford Westminster constituency is to be broken up and renamed Mid Down, covering an area stretching from Banbridge to Newtownards which will have an electorate of almost 77,800.\n\nPortaferry and a large part of the Ards peninsula, also currently in Strangford, will move into North Down.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe new Mid Down constituency will also include part of the current Lagan Valley constituency which is to become defunct under the revised proposals.\n\nIn addition to the transfer of the Killyleagh area into South Down, plans to move the Crossgar area from the constituency into Strangford have been aborted, while it is proposed to move Loughbrickland into South Down from Lagan Valley.\n\nThe new plan illustrates how Northern Ireland\u0026rsquos political borders could look like in years to come and there has been a mixed political reaction to moving Killyleagh back into South Down and retaining Crossgar in the constituency.\n\nRowallane councillor Billy Walker believes people in Killyleagh will be \u0026ldquounhappy about plans to move the area into South Down which is currently represented by Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard who does not take his seat at Westminster.\n\n\u0026ldquoCurrent Strangford MP Jim Shannon is recognised as one of the hardest working MPs at Westminster and while there are plans to create a new Mid Down constituency, I have no doubt the overwhelming majority of people in the Killyleagh area want to be represented at the heart of government in London by an MP who takes his seat, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoBallynahinch, Saintfield, Killyleagh, Derryboye and Kilmore and part of Crossgar are currently in Strangford and I have no doubt voters in these areas will want to be part of the new Mid Down constituency. From my point of view, I would like to see all of Crossgar in it.\n\nCllr Walker said he hopes the proposed boundary changes will not be rubber stamped, suggesting there is not an appetite for change among people in Killyleagh to move back into South Down.\n\nBut former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie, believes the retention of Crossgar in South Down and the plan to reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency is welcome.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt would appear that the integrity of the historic constituency of South Down has remained intact with the addition of Loughbrickland on the western flank. However, it would appear that the Boundary Commission has been listening to submissions made at their inquiries and has retained Crossgar within the historic boundary, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoAn interesting feature has been the addition of the Killyleagh electoral ward which was removed from the constituency about 22 years ago. If this is the case, then this is a welcome move in that it would reinstate historic social, trading, cultural, economic and educational ties within the South Down constituency.\n\nThe former MP argued the plan to retain Crossgar in South Down and reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency ensures that the existing economic, educational, health, social, parish, and transport ties that exist and will continue.\n\nMiss Ritchie added: \u0026ldquoThe recommendations ensure that the local population has a defined identity within the new constituency of South Down providing that greater level of homogeneity.\n\n\u0026ldquoSuch proposals would ensure that communities in Crossgar and Killyleagh can identy with their neighbours in Lecale and Downpatrick with whom they have had strong trading, health and economic links for many decades.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Kilcoo cruise through to last four  ","story":"\t\t\t\nKILCOO flexed their considerable muscle to send Downpatrick spiralling out of the SFC quarter-finals at St Patrick\u0026rsquos Park, Newcastle, on Saturday night.\n\nApart from a promising opening 15 minutes from Downpatrick, it really was all Kilcoo and two goals in eight minutes at the start of the second half put this tie to bed.\n\nThe influential Paul Devlin gave Kilcoo a third minute lead before Conor McGrady cancelled that score with a point for Downpatrick.

Their journey will taken over four months and will be fraught with danger from disease, crocodiles, swamps and fast-flowing rapids.\n\nNo-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus admits that their trip will not be easy. \u0026ldquoIt is a little frightening even thinking about it, but I am looking forward to it immensely, he said.\n\nMarcus is now living in Liverpool where he studied at the local university, and has been planning the expedition for the past two years.\n\nAfter travelling to the Ugandan border the eight will head north down the river through Sudan and Egypt. It is a journey which will take them through the Sudd \u0026mdash probably the world\u0026rsquos largest swamp \u0026mdash and through the foaming Nile cataracts.\n\nMarcus began canoeing at Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre outside Castlewellan, but only took up the sport seriously at university.\n\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never tackled anything as formidable as the Nile before, he said. \u0026ldquoPerhaps one of the hardest things has been trying to arrange sponsorship. We have each spent months writing letters to ious firms asking them for equipment. The cost of the trip will be around \u0026pound8,000.\n\nThe group are disappointed that they will not be able to travel over the complete  of the Nile because of the situation in Uganda, which has made it too dangerous to start at the head waters.\n\nHowever, they will still have the satisfaction of travelling over much of the ground covered by the Victorian explorers who struggled for decades to trace the Nile\u0026rsquos source.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash A \u0026pound28,000 scheme to deepen the harbour at Ardglass will begin within the next two weeks. Already a huge dredger has been brought to the site and a few explanatory digs have been made.\n\nThe work, when completed early in the new year, will allow fishing boats to land their catches alongside the market. At present it is impossible for the boats to unload their catches at the fish market during low tide.\n\nWith only some three feet of water modern day trawlers are just too big to lie in the harbour without bumping the bottom. The new scheme will aim at providing approximately ten feet of water at low tide, thus enabling the biggest of the boats to unload at the fish market.\n\nUntil then the boats will have to follow their usual and unsatisfactory custom of unloading at the main pier and having their catch transported by trucks to the market.\n\nNot since 1940 had dredging been carried out at Ardglass and the work will go a long way towards restoring Ardglass as a major fishing port.\n\nSTRANGFORD LOUGH \u0026mdash A secret experiment on Strangford Lough has helped scientists towards a major breakthrough in a three-year battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.\n\nResearch at Queen\u0026rsquos University in Belfast has now produced a revolutionary type of ocean buoy which could supply enough electricity for a town of 15,000 people. A chain or such buoys off our coast could one day be one of our main sources of power.\n\nDetails of the exciting new scheme were only released yesterday, though the Strangford Lough experiment took place almost a year ago. It was that small-scale which gave the scientists enough information to produce a design for a full-scale device.\n\nFour or five similar experiments are currently being considered by the Department of Energy in Britain for use in a wave energy programme and researchers at Queen\u0026rsquos are hoping their buoy will be one of those chosen.\n\nPORTAFERRY \u0026mdash The beautul peninsular town of Portaferry has been chosen for a major award in the Central Gardens Association Best Kept Villages and Towns competition for 1978.\n\nThe Association awarded Portaferry the title of \u0026lsquothe small town showing most improvement\u0026rsquo for its landscaping and environmental quality.\n\nCOMBER \u0026mdash News that a proposed sheltered housing scheme for Comber has been axed by the planners brought an angry reaction from local councillors this week.\n\nArds Borough councillors were told that a planning application from the Fold Housing Association for a housing scheme for the elderly in Castle Street had been refused on several grounds.\n\nComber councillor John Shields said: \u0026ldquoIt is this ridiculous that this application has been turned down. I think every effort should be made to accommodate the old people in the area.\n\nA planning official, Mr Des Stevens, said that the main objections had been that the department was not prepared to locate old people in an area where there was industrial development and also that there would be a problem of providing access for a housing scheme.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Tote betting s to Downpatrick racecourse for the first time in eight years at the end of the month.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, ersity in the church, compassion for the complexities of le and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own le journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by inidual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

ready to come forward with an \u0026#8220improved\u0026#8221 proposal on the Irish border.\n\n                \nAfter briefing EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Tuesday night, he insisted the EU offer would respect the “territorial integrity” of the UK.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nPrime Minister Theresa May in London on Sept 17, 2018\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHis comments came as EU leaders prepare to gather in Salzburg today for a summit – the first time they have met together since Mrs May published her Chequers blueprint for Brexit in July.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe Prime Minister is expected to brief the other 27 leaders on proposals over dinner and they will then have a separate discussion on Thursday after she has left.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe EU is insisting on a “backstop” proposal which would see Northern Ireland remain in the customs union in the event of the two sides failing to reach an agreement.\n\nHowever Mrs May has rejected the plan as unacceptable, arguing that it would effectively create a border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\n\nMr Barnier said he was working on a plan to “de-dramatise” the controls necessary in the event of the backstop coming into play.\n\n“We are ready to improve this proposal. Work on the EU side is ongoing,” he said.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“We are clarying which goods arriving in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would need to be checked and where, when and by whom these checks could be performed.\n\n“We can also clary that most checks can take place away from the border at the company premises or in the markets. We need to de-dramatise the checks that are needed.”\n\nHe said what is needed is a “legally operational backstop which fulls respects the territorial integrity of the UK”.\n\nHe said the next full summit of EU leaders on October 18 is the “moment of truth” when it would become clear  both sides can do a deal.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAny deal has to be finalised well in advance of the UK’s March 29, 2019 exit from the bloc so the parliaments in Westminster and Strasbourg can sign off on it.\n\nMr Barnier’s comments came after Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had earlier told the Dail in Dublin: “I do not anticipate there will be any change to the EU’s position or any change to our negotiating guidelines.”\n\nIt also followed remarks from Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who said it is time “compromises” made by the UK are “matched on the EU side”.\n\n“What I’m not going to do is to say that I would refuse to entertain any further proposals that the EU comes up with, but they’ve got to be respecting the equities that we’ve set out,” he said.\n\nOn Monday, Mrs May had framed the decision facing the country as a choice between her Chequers deal or no deal.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe prime minister’s Chequers plan had set out a vision of “ongoing harmonisation” with EU rules in an EU-UK “free trade area”, paying “due regard” to EU courts, and paying “appropriate contributions” to the EU.\n\nDUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson had previously voiced unhappiness with some aspects of the plan.\n\nOn Tuesday night he told the News Letter: “First of all the EU have to face up to reality – they’re not going to get Northern Ireland separated from the rest of the UK, because we will not support any move by the government to do that, and other parties in the House of Commons have said the same.”\n\nBut he also had this warning for Mrs May, saying that “she’s got to bear in mind the arithmetic of the House of Commons and begin to move on her position as well” – a reference to the fact she only commands a Commons majority with DUP support.\n\nEchoing comments made by the party earlier in the week, Mr Wilson also welcomed suggestions that the EU could be more open to considering technological solutions to the question of managing the Irish border after Brexit – something the Prime Minister herself has previously voiced doubts about.\n\nHe branded people who continually kept pouring cold water on the idea of tech-based fixes “pathetic parrots”.\n\nHe cited, for example, the idea that well-known firms could be given ‘trusted trader’ status when they move containers across the border.\n\nThey would input the details of goods which are due to cross the border into a computer, affix an identier to the vehicle, and this could be scanned electronically when it crosses the border.\n\nIf any spot check revealed discrepancies in the goods being carried, the firm would lose its ‘trusted trader’ status.\n\nSmaller volumes of goods from minor companies or farmers could well just be “ignored”, he said.\n\nAsked which aspect of May’s plans were most important to drop, he said the ones about remaining under EU rules by creating a kind of “regulatory alignment”.\n\nWhilst he said politicians may deem it desirable to adhere to certain EU rules past-Brexit anyway, he said this should be done “voluntarily”, not as part of an overarching pact.\n

here\u0027s what we know so far.\n                \n\nIs there a weather warning in place for Storm Ali?\n\nYes. The original yellow status severe weather warning has been upgraded to amber. The warning is valid throughout Northern Ireland from 8:00am to 5:00pm on Wednesday.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\nWhat does an amber weather warning from the Met Office actually mean?\n\nThere is an increased likelihood of impacts from severe weather, which could potentially disrupt your plans.\n\nThis means there is the possibility of travel delays, road and rail closures, power cuts and the potential risk to le and property.\n\nYou should think about changing your plans and taking action to protect yourself and your property.\n\nYou may want to consider the impact of the weather on your family and your community and whether there is anything you need to do ahead of the severe weather to minimise the impact.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\nWhat should I expect when Storm Ali arrives?\n\nThe following is a list of what to expect issued by the Met Office:\n\n- Flying debris is likely and could lead to Injuries or danger to le\n\n- Probably some damage to buildings, such as tiles blown from roofs or damage through falling trees and branches breaking\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n- Longer journey times and cancellations likely, as road, rail, air and ferry services may be affected\n\n- Power cuts may occur, with the potential to affect other services, such as mobile phone coverage\n\n- Some roads and bridges likely to close\n\n- Large waves could affect coastal roads, sea fronts and properties\n\n\nWhy is the storm called Ali?\n\nThe Met Office officially named the storm, Ali on Tuesday morning.\n\nLast week, the Met Office and Met Eireann released the names to be given to storms in 2018/19.\n\nAli is the first name in the list so the storm is the first to be named since the new names were published.\n\nThe next storm will be called Bronagh.\n\n\nHow strong is the storm expected to be?\n\nStorm Ali is expected to bring a very windy spell of weather with gusts of 65-75 mph inland.\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n
