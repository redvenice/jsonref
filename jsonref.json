He’s currently the Workers’ Party candidate for President of Brazil in the upcoming 2018 election.Haddad was born in São Paulo, Brazil on January 25, 1963.The son of Lebanese immigrants, he earned a master’s degree in economics and a doctorate in philosophy from the University of São Paulo before starting a career as an investment analyst at Unibanco.Haddad later worked as a consultant for the Institute of Economic Research Foundation before moving into public sector work, finding employment as the chief of staff to the Finance and Economic Development Secretary for São Paulo and eventually as a special advisor at the Brazilian Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management.Climbing the ranks of government steadily, he later was named as the Minister of Education for Brazil in July 2005. During his tenure, Haddad established the Basic Education Development Index to help better measure the quality of public primary and middle schools in Brazil.He also oversaw the implementation of a new scholarship program aimed at helping low-income students attend private colleges and made numerous reforms to the country’s National High School Exam.Haddad left his position in January 2012 and was named as the candidate for Mayor of São Paulo during the 2012 municipal elections in Brazil. After advancing to the second round of the election, he defeated the city’s former mayor, José Serra, with just over 55 per cent of the vote.After assuming his new duties as mayor in January 2013, he implemented a sweeping expansion of the city’s bike lane network but later sparked a major backlash in June of that year after announcing, along with the government of the state of São Paulo, that mass transit ticket prices would be increased.The decision ultimately led to mass protests in the São Paulo and many other major Brazilian cities.          Fernando Haddad served as the Mayor of São Paulo from January 2013 until January 2017By July 2016, Haddad was hobbled by a dismal approval ratings of only 14 per cent of city residents and lost his reelection bid in October 2016 to João Doria, the Brazilian Social Democracy party candidate.He ultimately left office in January 2017 after a four-year tenure as mayor of Brazil’s largest city.As the 2018 Brazil elections loomed, he was named as former President Lula da Silva’s running mate in August in his bid to regain the presidency.However, da Silva was later ruled as disqualified from running for president again by the Superior Electoral Court for violating the country’s Clean Record Act shortly afterwards on August 31 due to his conviction on corruption charges.Haddad was eventually named as da Silva’s replacement by the Workers’ Party on September 11 while Brazil Communist Party legislator Manuela d\u0027Ávila took his place as the candidate for vice president. 2018 Brazil election polls   According a recent Americas SocietyCouncil of the Americas poll, Haddad is currently in second place ahead of the election, which will be held in stages from October 7 to October 28. Haddad leads a number of other candidates but still trails Bolsonaro, the conservative populist frontrunner of the Social Liberty Party who many have compared to U.S. President Donald Trump. Bolsonaro leads the poll with 35 percent of the vote while Haddad trails with 22 percent. Notably, Haddad\u0027s polling numbers have largely flatlined in recent days while Bolsonaro has surged ahead, making his victory, while not a sure thing, all the more likely as the election gets underway.Hurricane Michael: Tracker, path, evacuation zones and moreHow to check if you have a Google Plus account and how to delete itAmerican Music Awards 2018: All you need to knowAda Lovelace Day 2018: When is it and who was Ada Lovelace?Made by Google Pixel 3: How to watch the event and what to expectWorld Post Day: 2018 theme, date and moreNew Kids on the Block Mixtape Tour 2019: Dates, tickets, support acts and moreJohn Terry\u0027s net worth revealed after he retires from football2018 midterms: When are the voter registration deadlines in all the 50 states?The Walking Dead Season 9 Spoilers: What time does it start in the UK and what happens in the premiere?How to tell if your Facebook account has been hackedStrictly Come Dancing: Seann Walsh and Katya Jones slammed by Piers MorganRiverdale season 3: Spoilers, premiere date, time, trailer, cast and more revealedStrictly Come Dancing 2018: What is the Strictly curse?Who is Sat Hari Khalsa?

Regardless, the storm is expected to deal serious damage to both coastal and inland communities thanks to its strong winds and heavy rains.Even if it doesn’t intensify as much as forecast, the storm is still expected to be very dangerous, bringing hurricane-force winds greater than 74 miles per hour to the northeastern Gulf Coast by Wednesday, October 10 in the area currently under a hurricane warning.  This area currently s  from just north of Tampa Bay Area to the Alabama coastline, though tropical storm-force winds above 39 miles per hour are also expected to be felt in this area from the night of Tuesday, October 9 until the morning of Wednesday, October 10.Areas just outside the hurricane warning region currently under a tropical storm warning will likely see tropical storm-force winds on the night of Tuesday, October 9 and morning of Wednesday, October 10.          The powerful hurricane will bring torrential rains, strong winds and catastrophic storm surgeThe hurricane’s path is projected to bring widespread power outages to the Florida Panhandle region and even to southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia, potentially leaving up to two million people without power from Florida to southeastern Virginia.In addition, life-threatening storm surges as high as eight to 12 feet are possible from the western end of the Florida Panhandle all the way to the Tampa Bay Area.For rainfall, the storm is expected to dump four to eight inches in the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend region of Florida into southern Georgia and southeastern Alabama. Local rainfall of up to a foot is possible while life-threatening flash flooding cannot be ruled out either.Eastern Georgia, the Carolinas and southern Virginia could potentially see three to six inches of rain while parts of the Florida Peninsula, Mid-Atlantic and New England regions could possibly see one to three inches of rain.The storm could also bring some isolated tornadoes to the Florida Panhandle and southern Georgia.Hurricane Michael evacuation zonesAs the dangerous storm bears down on the Florida Panhandle and broader northeastern Gulf Coast region, mandatory evacuations have already been issued.Three Florida counties have ordered mandatory evacuations, including Gulf County, where the storm could potentially make a direct landfall hit.Wakulla County has ordered a mandatory evacuation for all residents in its Zone A evacuation zone as well as for residents living in weak structures and mobile homes. Bay County has also issued a mandatory evacuation for Zones A, B and C.Hurricane Michael landfallThough the exact landfall area of the monstrous storm isn’t yet known, officials have expressed increased confidence that it will ultimately be in the Florida Panhandle.Florida Governor Rick Scott didn’t mince words when warning residents about the storm, saying: ‘Hurricane Michael is forecast to be the most destructive storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in decades.’          The Florida Panhandle is in the crosshairs of Hurricane Michael as it barrels towards the coastAccording to FEMA official Jeff Byard, hurricane-force winds are expected to extend ‘well inland’ from where the storm makes landfall, noting that Florida’s power infrastructure could be hit even worse than North and South Carolina’s during Hurricane Florence.In preparation for the storm, President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency in 35 Florida counties and said that 2,000 National Guard members were mobilized to assist with the preparation and recovery efforts.Scott again issued a dire warning to his state’s residents as the hurricane took aim at the Florida Panhandle, saying: ‘Water will come miles inshore and could easily be over the roofs of houses.‘You cannot hide from storm surge so get prepared and get out if an evacuation is ordered.‘Remember, we can rebuild your house, but we cannot rebuild your life.’ Hurricane Michael: Tracker, path, evacuation zones and moreHow to check if you have a Google Plus account and how to delete itAmerican Music Awards 2018: All you need to knowAda Lovelace Day 2018: When is it and who was Ada Lovelace?Made by Google Pixel 3: How to watch the event and what to expectWorld Post Day: 2018 theme, date and moreNew Kids on the Block Mixtape Tour 2019: Dates, tickets, support acts and moreJohn Terry\u0027s net worth revealed after he retires from football2018 midterms: When are the voter registration deadlines in all the 50 states?The Walking Dead Season 9 Spoilers: What time does it start in the UK and what happens in the premiere?How to tell if your Facebook account has been hackedStrictly Come Dancing: Seann Walsh and Katya Jones slammed by Piers MorganRiverdale season 3: Spoilers, premiere date, time, trailer, cast and more revealedStrictly Come Dancing 2018: What is the Strictly curse?Who is Sat Hari Khalsa?

To now learn that the factory isn’t even in the UK is simply shocking.’The revelation follows news that a second Pret customer had died following an allergic reaction.She was named yesterday as Celia Marsh, 42.

The firm has pledged to review its labelling methods following criticism from the coroner.The Bridor plant in Servon-sur-Vilaine that supplies Pret dominates an industrial estate just off the E50 arterial motorway across Europe.The complex is surrounded by a large security fence, with its financial success only alluded to by an adjoining glass building housing the headquarters of its multi-billion parent company, Group Le Duff.    Mother of five Celia Marsh, 42, died last December after eating a ‘super-veg rainbow flatbread’ containing a yoghurt that was supposed to be dairy-free but contained milkBakers leaving the factory over the weekend were reluctant to speak and Bridor did not respond to requests for comment. However one worker in the firm’s head office confirmed the factory provided bread to Pret in Britain.Bridor also has a base in Camberley, Surrey, staffed by young bakers from Eastern Europe, France, Italy and even China, all working round the clock.The Mail has seen a label from a box of 30 part-baked frozen Bridor baguettes which were in use at a central London Pret last week. The date of production was September 6 2018 and the best before September 6 2019.Bridor is not believed to Pret’s only bread supplier. George Fuller of the Craft Bakers Association said: ‘Their products could easily be made in Britain, which is quite frustrating.‘Their decision to describe their products as fresh and natural has the potential to annoy our members. There is no legal definition for this, as such, so you end up in a situation where they can call their products what they want.‘The demise of the high street baker is a serious concern to us and the fact a chain with such a big presence in Britain is making their bread abroad is a worry.’    Pret was already in the spotlight because of last month’s inquest into the death of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse (pictured) from an allergic reaction to sesame seeds in a baguetteEarlier this year, Pret was at the centre of a case involving the Advertising Standards Authority about the descriptions it uses for its products. As a result it was told to stop using the word ‘natural’ in its marketing and on its website because of the use of several additives in its supplier-made bread.The Real Bread Campaign had found E-numbers in its bread which were not labelled on packs. However, Pret was allowed to keep saying its bread was freshly-baked as the ASA said customers would not necessarily think that meant it was made from scratch.Yesterday, Pret did not dispute that it used Bridor as a supplier. When asked specifically about describing frozen products as fresh, it referred the Mail to the ASA ruling.The Pret statement said: ‘The ASA ruled that consumers were unlikely to interpret “baked in store” to mean only products that were made from scratch using basic raw materials such as flour and butter.          A statement from Pret said the ASA ruled consumers were \u0027unlikely to interpret “baked in store” to mean only products that were made from scratch using basic raw materials...\u0027‘We considered that consumers were likely to interpret it to include products which were cooked from frozen raw dough or from part-baked dough.’Pret also said: ‘Once the bread is fully-baked in shops it is sold on the day or given to charity.’There is no suggestion that Bridor was in any way responsible for Natasha’s death, a point made by a Pret a Manger spokesman.Boxes of baguettes sent to Pret a Manger from Bridor, which is said to make products for coffee chains Starbucks, Costa and Caffè Nero, clearly label all ingredients and allergen information in four languages.One ‘artisan’ baguette label seen by the Mail also listed the potential allergens wheat, gluten and nuts.The founder of Bridor is billionaire Frenchman Louis Le Duff, known as the “pastry king”.He made his fortune after founding French cafe chain Brioche Dorée in 1976. It now has more than 600 bakeries around the world, with Le Duff vowing that it would have a turnover of one billion euros a year by 2020. "},{"url":null,"title":"Grieving bride wears wedding dress fiances grave day marry","story":"    Heartbroken bride, Jessica Padgett (pictured), wore her wedding dress to visit her fiance Kendall James Murphy\u0027s grave on the day they were supposed to say \u0027I do\u0027          In honor of her husband\u0027s memory, Jessica posed for several photos with Murphy\u0027s boots, his tombstone, his firefighting gear and with loved ones on September 29, the day they were supposed to get married           The photos were taken by Loving Life Photography and shared on Facebook.

Her art gives pleasure to the eye and to the mind and to the touch, if only one were allowed to touch. One wants to feel the braid and nub, to finger the frays and proud threads, the tightness and looseness and differences between soft and wiry, metallic and plastics in her weavings. Smell, too, might play its part, but mostly all this is in the imagination. Sensuality – bordering on the sexual – and geometric rigour, variety and similarity (pleasures that demand being repeated) infuse the work of a lifetime in Albers’ show.I almost inhaled this exhibition, that takes us from the Bauhaus to Black Mountain College and to Yale – along with her husband, the painter Josef Albers – and from a very particular European modernism to postwar America. Berlin-born in 1899, Anni Albers began her studies at the Bauhaus in 1922. For all its aspirations to equality, like other female students Albers was discouraged from joining painting classes and was directed towards the weaving workshop. However, disciplines are porous and interconnected, and few more so than textiles. And as Julia Bryan-Wilson points out in her marvellous recent book Fray: Art and Textile Politics, “Just as textiles have stretched between art, craft and industry, they have also oscillated between being defined as leisure and as labour.” There are textiles everywhere in our lives, our history, our cultures, our politics.At the Bauhaus, Albers found her medium. Who is to say that she would not have been similarly competent and creative had she entered the painting school, or any other? Here, as well as meeting Josef Albers, she came into contact with Paul Klee, whose influence remained strong throughout her career and particularly influenced what she called her “pictorial” weavings. Everything is a picture, even if it is only a conjunction of stripes, lozenges or rectangles. Even at its most pictorial, her art is abstract. Even at its most geometric it feels human and alive, less the product of the mechanics of the loom – the construction of a matrix of threads, and fibres, warp and weft – than of the hand and the mind.Anni Albers’ textile art gives pleasure to a room, to a wall, a bed, a floor, to the spaces in between. Things are framed on walls, hang freely in space, are lain flat. The Tate exhibition goes from room to room, and in spaces created using walls of stretched translucent scrim, to outline not just her development but also her processes.There are grilles and grids of woven colour, close-toned patterns and wandering webs, flexing chevrons and teaming bands, oddly reminiscent of the untuned pixelated glitches that bedevil the images when we’re streaming a movie. But here the jumbling visual noise resolves in clusters of pattern, tiny rows of pictograms and mysterious signs.She drew knots and tangles, like madcap versions of those animated diagrams that help fishermen and sailors learn the mechanics of arcane knots, except here the pleasure is in following the twists and loops and over- and under-passes for nothing more than the pleasure of losing oneself in their inextricable entanglements.This is all as good as any abstract art. Albers made textiles not as a substitute for painting, but on its own terms. Even so, whole careers could be made (and probably have been) from the dozens of different forays she made in her weavings, and later in her prints. She made drawings from pinpricks through paper and prints from nothing more than the embossment of abstract shapes on heavy white paper. As you move around these prints, light catches the ridges and depressions, first this way, then that, gleaming against whiteness.Albers’ hand-woven art is a lesson in colour and geometry, method and singularity tactile and optical, spatial and utilitarian most of all, her work gives pleasure, and this exhibition (organised in conjunction with K20 in Dusseldorf) is a revelation and a delight.Going from room to room, I thought of poet Wallace Stevens’ three statements presaging the parts of his Notes Towards a Supreme Fiction: it must be abstract. It must change. It must give pleasure, he wrote. Albers’ art did all these things, as this retrospective demonstrates. Although light levels are often low, to protect the works with their sometimes fugitive dyes and fragile materials, her art sings and vibrates and keeps you looking, following patterns and meandering lines, maze-like structures, grids and colourways. The only demand is that you look, getting up close and stepping away, going from the overall to the detail, sensing materiality as well as the optical. What a joy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1072fe2393876745006894759d7365c3f5bc5b69/103_84_3462_2077/master/3462.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=666a98d09fcfc18836a829ba14c6995f","title":"chimamanda ngozi adichie accepts pen pinter prize with call to speak out","story":"Arguing that authors have a duty to ‘call a lie a lie’, novelist also names human rights activist Waleed Abulkhair as the 2018 International Writer of CourageChimamanda Ngozi Adichie has spoken out about the responsibility of authors to engage with politics and “call a lie a lie”, as she accepted the PEN Pinter prize on Tuesday evening.Awarded to an outstanding writer who shows “the real truth of our lives and our societies” with their work, the prize went this year to the Nigerian novelist who judges described as “sophisticated beyond measure in her understanding of gender, race, and global inequality”.In her acceptance lecture at the British Library, Adichie said that while writers should not necessarily speak out on political issues, she did not believe “that art is a valid reason for evading the responsibilities of citizenship – which are to think clearly, to remain informed, and, sometimes, to act and speak”.“Art can illuminate politics. Art can humanise politics. Art can shine the light towards truth. But sometimes that is not enough. Sometimes politics must be engaged with as politics. And this could not be any truer or more urgent today, with the political landscapes of many western countries so blatantly awash in what Harold Pinter called ‘a vast tapestry of lies, upon which we feed’. We must know what is true. And we must call a lie a lie,” said Adichie in her lecture, entitled Shut Up and Write.The award-winning novelist revealed how she has been criticised in Nigeria for speaking out about its law criminalising homosexuality, and for her efforts to start a “much-needed conversation” about women’s rights in the country.Reactions to her arguments had seen her told that “I could not, as an African, claim to be a feminist because feminism and being African were mutually exclusive. Feminism was a sickness of the west, and one I had appropriated by being poisoned by the west. As for gay people, homosexuality was un-African, and my supporting the rights of gay people meant a disregard of African culture.”Adichie said that she did not choose to speak out about social issues because she is a writer. “But my writing gave me a platform to speak about issues that I have always cared about,” she said. “I do not want to use my art as an armour of neutrality behind which to hide. I am a writer and I am a citizen, and I see my speaking out on social issues as a responsibility of citizenship. I am struck by how often this speaking out is met, in Nigeria, not with genuine engagement, whether to agree or disagree, but with a desire to silence me. A journalist once helpfully summed it up for me: people don’t like it when you talk about feminism, they just want you to shut up and write.”At the ceremony, Adichie named the lawyer and human rights activist Waleed Abulkhair as this year’s International Writer of Courage, a title awarded by the PEN Pinter winner each year. Abulkhair, a founding member of the Monitor of Human Rights in Saudi Arabia, is currently four years into a 15-year prison sentence after being charged with undermining the regime and officials, inciting public opinion and insulting the judiciary. He also represented the Saudi dissident writer Raif Badawi in court, whose 2014 sentence of 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes prompted outrage around the world.According to PEN, after Abulkhair set up salons for liberal youth to discuss new ideas, following the tightening of laws around public gatherings, a judge and several clerics “demanded that death be the punishment for speaking openly about opposition to religious conservatism”. His sentence also includes a 15-year travel ban and a 200,000 riyal (£41,000) fine.PEN said he has been denied medication, books and post in jail. Abulkhair told the Washington Post in 2012: “I am unable to leave this country, but the sun of humanity shines upon me every day. I bask in its rays, gaining strength against the darkness of oppression. My voice and the voices of others like me shall reach the world, no matter how hard they try to silence us. We shall say, consistently and proudly: steadfastness.”“Waleed has dedicated his life to holding the Saudi authorities accountable for human rights abuses,” said Adichie. “He has dedicated his life to speaking out, to supporting the victims of those abuses. Waleed, like Harold Pinter, has shown a lucid dedication to telling his truth. But rather than being lauded for this dedication, Waleed has paid a heavy price – 15 years behind bars.”She said she was deeply proud to share the prize with Abulkhair, “and I hope that this small act of solidarity will bring him some comfort, and will remind him that his struggle has not been forgotten, nor will it be in vain.”Adichie joins former winners of the PEN Pinter prize including Salman Rushdie, Carol Ann Duffy and Margaret Atwood. Previous recipients of the International writer of courage include Bangladeshi publisher and writer Ahmedur Rashid Chowdhury, also known as Tutul and Italian investigative journalist Roberto Saviano."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6810721258ccdce15e448f512dc42a4ef1390089/0_186_2891_1734/master/2891.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=580949efddb4b12af9e72f1471f2e50d","title":"bank of england calls clear heads avoid no deal mayhem","story":"EU will be big loser if agreement not reached for UK clearers to handle £69tn derivatives marketWhat the hell is the European commission playing at? Don’t they know they risk seeing financial markets fall off the edge of a cliff?The sober suits on the Bank of England’s financial policy committee did not put it like that, but one could catch their drift. When the Bank describes a “pressing” need for EU authorities to take “mitigating actions”, it means the position is serious. So it is: Threadneedle Street is talking about financial derivatives contracts worth £69tn, of which £41tn could conceivably have to be moved before next March, a task that would be either hideously expensive or impossible to achieve.The numbers almost sound too big to be meaningful but the derivatives market really is enormous. In fact, the £69tn and £41tn figures relate only to the notional size of the contracts held by EU-based firms at UK-based clearers, outfits that stand in the middle of the market to clean up any mess. Those contracts – interest rate and currency swaps and so on – are the everyday business of financial markets and ultimately serve to keep money flowing and reduce borrowing costs. To avoid mayhem next March, this stuff has to continue to work.If left alone, the technocrats could probably solve the problem before lunch. The Bank and the European Central Bank in Frankfurt have a joint working party that is said to be working happily. The finger of suspicion, therefore, points at Brussels. Is the commission playing games of brinkmanship to try to drive financial business out of London? Or does it seriously believe – as nobody else does – that firms can rejig the contracts in the remaining time?Whatever the explanation, the Bank is probably sick of issuing dire warnings. It has been shouting about the risks to financial stability since last December. Financial markets have been sanguine, probably believing common sense will prevail, which is still the most likely outcome regardless of what happens with the wider trade talks. But one almost wishes markets would throw a tantrum. A no-deal Brexit, if it were to mean no deal whatsoever on derivative contracts, would be an absurd calamity.For a certain breed of chief executive, a seat on the board of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is a serious prize. It is a sign you are a player on the global stage, fit to share visionary thoughts with similarly high-minded corporate titans.Mark Wilson at Aviva always gave the impression he viewed the BlackRock gig as too juicy to resist. He took the part-time post in March in defiance of complaints from some Aviva shareholders and the private muttering of colleagues. Doubters reckoned the chief executive of a large FTSE 100 insurer, especially one with a competing fund management business, should stick to the day job.The critics have won that little quarrel. Wilson was pushed out of Aviva on Tuesday, accompanied by praise for past achievements but also the stinging comment from its chairman, Sir Adrian Montague, that “this is the right time for a new leader to ensure Aviva delivers to its full potential”.Changing the boss looks fair. The BlackRock posting was no deal breaker but it reinforced the impression that Wilson, after six years in post, was more interested in his next career move than in finding ways for Aviva to grow. Wilson’s cleanup of the chaos he inherited at the insurer in 2013 was impressive and the idend recovery was strong, but you can’t live off turnaround glories for ever. The share price has gone nowhere since the takeover of Friends Life in 2015.The fiasco of Aviva’s attempt to redeem “irredeemable” preference shares cannot be laid solely at Wilson’s door since the move was approved by the whole board. But the grumble in the wings that the boss had lost the support of his fellow executives rings true. In the circumstances, Montague \u0026amp co had little choice but to act. When the chief executive is on a pay package worth more than £6m a year, it is reasonable to expect his full attention."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32395a5b133f28e68ec2cad01a267263f984a3c2/0_0_4614_3076/master/4614.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69c3272acbecb2cf4b87ec61b4e46ba6 660w","title":"catfish won the circle nice people tv","story":"It was the moment of awkward drama we had been waiting for.

For the last 10 minutes of the series, it seemed as if a social experiment for the digital era – Big Brother meets Black Mirror – had become a gaudy celebration of deceit. But while that was the take embodied by today’s headlines, it’s not how I saw The Circle, or even Alex’s victory.The Circle confirmed what has been evident in reality TV for some time now. We prefer nice people. Nice people win. Strictly, this week’s snog scandal notwithstanding, is a nice show in which nice people dance. See also Bake Off and its derivatives. Even Love Island, a show entirely set up to enable bed-swapping, back-stabbing and voyeurism, couldn’t help but become, in the latest series, a love-in when the nicest, most faithful couple, Dani and Jack, won.In The Circle, about half of the contestants chose to deceive to some extent. But even in the simulated mire of social media, the catfishes couldn’t help but play nice too. The big difference was motive. Real catfishes set out to humiliate and dominate, exploiting victims for kicks. In The Circle, they set out to win some cash, sure, but also not explicitly to fool, but rather to experiment with or escape social labels. That was what made the show fascinating – and often very funny.Genelle decided not to reveal that she was caring for her six-month-old baby to remember what it was like not to be defined only as a mother. Mairead, 57, set out to be herself, pretty much, but used a much younger profile picture. She wanted to remember what it was like not to be a 50-something “invisible” orcee (she bloody loved it). Freddie, a ribald Essex boy, set out to play it straight not because he is ashamed of being gay (he really, really isn’t) but because he was fed up with women seeing him only as a stereotypical “gay best friend”.Alex, meanwhile, said he had been the victim of a catfish in real life, and wanted to expose the perils of trust online, while also taking on the challenge of creating a popular young woman. His was the greatest deception, but that burden wore him down, and he tried desperately to avoid romance. When more astute contestants got suspicious early on, he only started to become popular by bringing more of his own personality into his fake persona (and, yep, he’s also a nice guy).The flashy final and cash prize risked killing off the complexity The Circle had built. No reality show can entirely escape accusations of voyeurism, but this one did more than that, exploring the fraught freedom of online identity in a new way. Guileless Dan came closest to being a victim, but even he had said, in a brief spell of doubt, that he wouldn’t care if Kate were fake because he liked their relationship. In the end, he sealed her victory by giving her high scores while others voted more tactically. Alex may yet consider repaying the favour with a chunk of his winnings. It may be that in this unlikely potential gesture niceness in reality TV finds its limit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d8e9070eec517cd4255ef7c78e86451b677e419/0_0_650_396/master/650.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6709fec7579cf5bfae8774ede4567ba","title":"antony sher was shakespeare a misogynist king lear cheltenham","story":"King Lear’s disgust at women may show playwright had problem with them, actor saysKing Lear’s revulsion at the female form and rage against womankind may be indicative of Shakespeare’s misogyny, the actor Sir Antony Sher has suggested.Sher’s performance as Lear for the Royal Shakespeare Company between 2016-18, directed by his husband, Gregory Doran, was praised as “unbearably moving” by the ’s Michael Billington.The actor told Cheltenham literature festival that some of the best scenes to play were also the most shocking, including Lear’s sexually disgusted rages against women with lines such as “the sulforous pit – burning, scalding, stench, consumption!”“It is startling,” said Sher. “It is so graphic about female genitalia. I don’t believe that in a modern play you could write that now, there is something so visceral in the way Shakespeare has Lear say it I began to wonder if there was some autobiographical stuff there.”Sher said he began to consider whether Shakespeare had “a problem with women”.“It is Lear’s attitude to Goneril particularly, when he curses her, he curses her womb … again it becomes very graphic,” he said, adding that there is something deep inside Lear that is misogynist.“It is actually great stuff to play because it is so full of disgust and anger,” he said.Sher’s interviewer, the Shakespearean academic Sir Jonathan Bate, said Sher might be on to something and there were “little bits of circumstantial evidence” that Shakespeare had syphilis.Bate said there was evidence of “a whiff of scandal” around Shakespeare: his hair fell out, he was not at court as much as other actors, perhaps because there was a law against anyone with syphilis going within 400 yards of the monarch.The question, it was said, was whether Shakespeare contracting syphilis could have fed and inflamed misogyny.Sher said: “There is also a lot of belief that Shakespeare was actually gay, which of course doesn’t mean he was anti-women.”He said he did not believe Lear could have the excuse of dementia, a theory that is often debated. Sher recalled consulting a psychologist who specialised in old age while he was researching the role. “My heart leaped with joy when he said I do not believe that Lear had dementia.”His expert, he said, pointed out that Lear begins the play by making retirement plans, which is not something people with dementia find they are able to do.Lear is one of the most demanding of any acting challenges and Sher said he began reading about previous productions but soon stopped. He said so many accounts of playing Lear are about how hard actors find it, “I just didn’t want to know that … I didn’t want to hear about the difficulties.”Sher’s husband, Doran, is the director of the Royal Shakespeare Company. The pair had learned on a previous production not to talk about work outside the rehearsal room.“We would have a gin or tonic or two and eventually he would get angry and plates would fly through the air. It was a baptism of fire.“It was terribly simple, the rule which we now obey, and which works brilliantly is you walk out of the room and the work is left behind, so that you come home with your partner, your friend. It is also fairer to the other actors.”Sher said he was from a generation who worshipped the great Shakespearean actors such as Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud and Peggy Ashcroft.“We worshipped and we followed what they did and we listened. I remember from South Africa getting an LP of the whole of Olivier’s Othello that he did at the National and listened to it again and again and again, just completely fascinated by it. I don’t think that younger actors are as obsessed by the tradition of Shakespeare as we were.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f99c666b7ec69cd1ce0f5d9b0bf5ac541bb7b20d/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08ebc1ed306cfee05bf7ba155b459384","title":"black tights or bare legs autumns crucial style debate returns","story":"It’s the million-dollar question for power dressers everywhere: have tights come in from the cold?There are three fundamental questions that must be addressed at this point in every year. Question one: is it time to switch the heating on? Question two: whose family are we having for Christmas? And, drumroll, question three: can we wear black tights?The first two are mere detail the third is everything. The opaque tights issue is a thorny one in fashion. It ides women along class and generational lines. Class lines, first, because going bare-legged in winter is a high-maintenance choice. To put it bluntly, having your legs bare in winter is no hardship if you have a driver waiting it is perfectly doable if you must wait four minutes for an Uber it is a battle if your bus isn’t coming for 20.Anna Wintour invented bare legs as a power move. The New York fashion week held in February is sometimes -10C and snow-drifted, sometimes just chilly, but never balmy. Around the beginning of this century, Wintour ditched black tights and started arriving at shows with bare legs and “nude” Manolo Blahnik slingbacks. The messaging was similar, in a funny kind of way, to that made by the Duchess of Cambridge in her three appearances on the steps of the Lindo Wing with newborn babies. Heels on, hair coiffed, teeth gritted. They tell the world that this is a woman who has the privilege of backroom staff, but who is also a tough cookie.And then there is the age ide. Bare-legged is the aesthetic of the Instagram native, the default setting of the members of a generation who are always “on”. Years before the reinvention of holidays as a performative popularitybeauty contest, the ditching of black tights signalled commitment to keeping up appearances. Kate Moss, the last of the great 20th-century icons, still wears black tights the It girls who came of age in the 00s don’t. When black, opaque tights make a partial return to catwalk favour, as they do every season or three, it is often in homage-to-the-90s form, with ankle strap sandals and slip dresses.

But Kline went public again on Monday, in the buildup to an FA council meeting on whether to sell Wembley to the Fulham owner, the US businessman Shahid Khan.Kline, who also describes himself as a consultant to Khan’s NFL team, the Jacksonville Jaguars, and a whistleblower, is understood to have contacted the FA by phone last Wednesday, then to have emailed the following day and met FA officials on Monday, before he then tweeted: “Dear FA Council (+relevant police, MPs, regulators, press etc). I have key evidence of systemic corruption relevant to the Wembley vote which I’d like to submit. Please request this info from me.”The police were called, apparently by Kline, to Fulham’s training ground last year, but there has been no news since of any investigation or arrests. Responding to Kline’s claims, a statement on behalf of Khan said: “This is nothing more than the same ongoing nonsense and bogus claims made by a former employee who left the club in 2017. Nothing here merits a further response.”The FA confirmed in a statement that Kline has been in touch and officials are now looking into his claims. “We have recently been contacted by Craig Kline who has made a series of allegations about Fulham FC,” the statement said. “We are currently in the process of reviewing these allegations.”The FA council will meet on Thursday to consider the proposed sale of Wembley to Khan, who has offered £600m to buy the stadium as a base for the NFL in London.The FA board has approved the proposal to be considered by the council, whose members from the amateur, national game want to be certain that the proceeds will go, as promised, to improving facilities at the game’s grassroots.The FA board has the authority itself to sanction the sale but wants to secure the agreement of the council and is expected to hold a vote on 24 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b22bafd4899b73dec0faea763531dcb7293d279/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7158609660c9b88b8fc986e8f4456f5","title":"google raf wembley fa technical directors course arsenal chelsea","story":"Arsenal and Chelsea are participating in a programme designed to haul football into the future. We get a taste with the studentsOn Monday morning at Google’s snazzy headquarters in Pancras Square a group of students in a second-floor corner office are discussing the particular foibles of their day jobs. Dougie Freedman and David Moss are debating data and its use in recruitment while Steve Walsh, interjecting, points to how difficult it is to gain a true picture of a prospective signing’s character. Jim Fraser, Chelsea’s head of youth recruitment, is talking restrictions and how a failure to qualify for the Champions League leaves a gaping hole in the coffers. Meanwhile Les Ferdinand, operating in another world a few miles down the road at Queens Park Rangers, cracks a broad smile and offers to “play a little violin” in sympathy – to whoops of laughter.That is merely a snapshot. The exchanges are passionate, provocative and insightful, with the first intake enlisted on the Football Association’s new level five course for technical directors calling upon their own experiences while their host, Kirk Vallis, global head of creative capability development at Google, and a handful of consultants and tutors take it all in.This is uncharted territory for the nine candidates, many in situ at clubs, on a 20-month course aimed at developing skills in a role the English game has belatedly embraced. That Manchester United operate without a sporting director increasingly feels quirky, although, judging by the noises from Old Trafford, that may be about to change. Burnley have advertised for a technical director, meaning nine Premier League clubs are set to have such a position by the start of next year.The course is the brainchild of Dan Ashworth, who will leave his role as the FA’s technical director to take up a similar post at Brighton next spring. The 47-year-old had championed a pathway for scouts and heads of recruitment to complement that already in place for coaching and medical staff. There was a vacuum which needed filling to give those working in a multidimensional role, or earmarked to take on such duties, a better chance of success.The five‑tiered programme, drawn up after dialogue last year with a pilot group that included Paul Mitchell, now at RB Leipzig, and Nick Hammond, formerly of West Brom, mirrors the coaching educational structure, with the top level equivalent to the pro licence. It is not designed to teach people how to be sporting directors, not least because the demands of specific clubs vary wildly. But, by challenging candidates to be more open-minded on management techniques, the hope is they identify what can be adapted to their roles.“The course aims to stimulate and support them,” says Ashworth. “The role carries different titles – football director, sporting director, general manager – but more and more English clubs have recognised the value of someone with the club’s long-term interests at heart and not just winning on Saturday. Sporting directors look at the academy, at contracts and budgets, at short- and long-term talent identification, and act as a fulcrum for owners, boards, manager, the coaching staff and everyone. They are increasingly recognised as essential when it comes to implementing a philosophy at a club. So we asked the pilot group: ‘What do you wish someone had told you four years ago before you started in the job?’ and built the course from there.”The six modules over nine get‑togethers tackle everything from critical thinking and self-awareness to analytics, via communication skills and managing the press. Before the sessions on leadership with Vallis and YouTube’s Terri Scriven there had been talks by Nokia Global’s head of leadership development, Joel Casse, Harry Bartlett from the SAS and Gemma Morgan, a Sandhurst graduate and the first woman awarded the Carmen Sword for outstanding performance as a young officer. A flight simulation is pencilled in with the RAF at Brize Norton to scrutinise decision-making under cognitive load (or, in football parlance, coping with transfer deadline day). Caspar Berry, who spent three years as a professional poker player, led the group in an examination of risk.More conventionally, there was a three-day visit to Germany, spending time at BMW scrutinising recruitment and with Hasan Salihamidzic at Bayern Munich, Stuttgart’s head of sport Michael Reschke and Red Bull Salzburg’s Christopher Vivell. “There are always subtle differences to their roles but the core issues are the same,” says Walsh, who played a key role at Leicester in their title-winning season before a spell at Everton. “Recruitment is key, so you need exhaustive knowledge of the players and the industry, but developing other skills to help communicate ‘up’ within a club, or develop your own team – whether scouting, medical, psychology or academy – is just as critical. Ultimately, all Premier League clubs will have someone in the role within the next 18 months. The course is trying to define the skill set required, and coming up with very interesting ways of doing that.”The previous day had been spent at Wembley conducting role plays on “critical conversations” with a team of professional actors. The scenarios did not revolve around football – one involved a film director intent on casting Hugh Grant in a role, only for the studio to demand Steven Seagal play the part – but the parallels were clear. “I’ve been in football a long time, and in some really senior positions, but there has not always been this kind of training, to emerge with a win-win situation,” says Moss, who has overseen Celtic’s scouting operation and was head of football operations at Huddersfield after their promotion to the Premier League. “Coming to Google is just as illuminating. If the culture in a club is right, it means you have good people, a clear strategy and unity. So to see how Google recruit, their strategies for progression, the way they treat staff, the working environment, was fascinating. People have a spring in their step and are passionate about their work. Football clubs can learn a hell of a lot from a company like this.”Moss is armed with a master’s degree in sporting directorship from Manchester politan University, but each of the students on the FA’s course boasts experience or current employment at clubs with contrasting demands. Freedman is at Crystal Palace in the Premier League, Ferdinand consolidating QPR in the Championship and Grétar Steinsson with Fleetwood in League One. Matt Crocker is head of coach and player development at the FA, Heather Cowan oversees Birmingham City Women as general manager, Steve Morrow heads up Arsenal’s youth scouting ision, while Brian Tevreden was Reading’s technical director until recently being appointed chief executive at the owners’ Belgian club, KSV Roeselare. It is a erse group, and the onus is on each to cherrypick aspects addressed in the lectures that can benefit their specific role.The FA and its consultants, Leading Edge, provide each with an executive coach – a mentor from outside the game – to offer advice and support between sessions. Where resistance flares up most obviously is over an instinct to revert to the default: football has its own way of working, so how do any of the techniques advocated by big business apply? The game, as the cliche goes, is unique. “But why not challenge it, change it and improve it?” asks Mike Rigg, formerly a technical director at Manchester City, chief football officer at Fulham and head of talent management with the FA, now acting as a consultant. “There’s a new group of people coming into clubs with an unbelievable amount to offer who have not emerged along traditional routes, as ex-players turned coaches.“They have studied the game, or are armed with master’s degrees or PhDs, and are raising standards whether as data analysts, scouts, counsellors, nutritionists or in medical departments. They are helping the game evolve and are a breath of fresh air bringing new perspectives, and their line manager would be the sporting director. That role requires a bigger skill set now because it effectively oversees specialists on sports science, scouting, analytics, welfare, wellbeing, mental health … hence this course giving people a better understanding of what the future game will be.”Football is adapting. The hope is those students around the table at Google will be better equipped to oversee what happens next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94dbc02ef5457f312a7718cc3f1c40bea5e43ed0/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=857964ca3be5224305a4cb767fa1d6aa","title":"next generation 2014 17 how have our players got on","story":"Marcus Rashford and Ousmane Dembélé were part of our first batch of promising players in 2014. Here you can find out how all 290 have got onIn 2014 we set out to select some of the most promising players in the world and follow them for five years. It started as 20 Premier League players (one from each club) and 40 from the rest of the world. The global one was quickly expanded to 50 (2015) and the current 60 (2016 and 2017), meaning this year we have chased updates for 290 players.It has been a fascinating journey to find out how these extremely talented players have done. Some of them, such as Marcus Rashford and Ousmane Dembélé, have become international stars while others are no longer with a club. Some have been hampered by injuries while others have made it to their club’s first team or been involved in multimillion-pound transfers.So before we announce our 2018 picks on Wednesday (Premier League) and Thursday (rest of the world) here is your chance to see how all the players have got on (and also, hopefully, appreciate that our design has improved somewhat in the past four years …). Follow the links and explore how each player has progressed by clicking on them once on the interactive.Twenty of the best talents at Premier League clubs: An excellent year for the players (and the journalists who picked them) as this crop featured Dominic Solanke and Marcus Rashford as well as Arsenal’s Chris Willock. You can find the names and the player profiles behind the badges (the Premier League one) and the flags (on the world one).Forty of the best young talents in world football: Youri Tielemans and Dembélé are among the talented players born in 1997 that we selected for this year but, for me, this year will always be remembered for Abdelhak Nouri’s inclusion. The talented Dutch midfielder was set for his international breakthrough in 2017-18 when he suffered cardiac arrhythmia and collapsed on the pitch during a friendly against Werder Bremen in July 2017. Ajax later said that Nouri had suffered permanent and serious brain damage. Earlier this year Abderrahim Nouri said that his brother had been gradually improving since the start of this year and he can now communicate with his family by moving his mouth or eyebrows.Twenty of the best talents at Premier League clubs: The player who stands out here is Trent Alexander-Arnold, who reached the Champions League final with Liverpool last season and played for England at the World Cup, while Marcus McGuane moved from Arsenal to Barcelona in January.Fifty of the best young talents in world football: It is amazing to think that Christian Pulisic is still only 20. He has played 74 Bundesliga games for Borussia Dortmund and has 21 caps for the United States. He was part of our 2015 picks and there is another BVB player among this crop: Jacob Bruun Larsen. The Dane had struggled with injuries and was loaned to Stuttgart last season, but has started the new campaign like a house on fire and recently scored three goals in three games for the first team. This year we also had “the Colombian Yaya Touré”, Dejan Lovren’s younger brother Davor and Martin Ødegaard.Twenty of the best talents at Premier League clubs: An interesting batch of players with Jadon Sancho the one who has made the most progress, having joined Borussia Dortmund from Manchester City in the summer of 2017. He was immediately given the No 7 shirt and has exploded on to the scene in Germany, earning a call-up to Gareth Southgate’s England squad for the first time last week. Arsenal’s Reiss Nelson has also moved to Germany, while there are still high hopes for Liverpool’s Ben Woodburn and Manchester United’s Angel Gomes.Sixty of the best young talents in world football: Another year, another prodigy. Gianluigi Donnarumma was one of the players born in 1999 and an absolute certainty on the list, having played for Italy before our list was announced. He has continued to progress and has played more than 120 games for Milan. Other names to look out for here are the Belgian Mile Svilar, who became the youngest goalkeeper to play in the Champions League, Diogo Dalot (now at Manchester United) and Ajax’s Matthijs de Ligt, surely a future Oranje captain.Twenty of the best talents at Premier League clubs: These players, of course, have had only a year to progress but there are still some who are becoming well known. Callum Hudson-Odoi has played in the Premier League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup for Chelsea and was outstanding in pre-season for Maurizio Sarri, while Liverpool’s Curtis Jones made a huge impression when given a chance by Jürgen Klopp on their US tour in the summer. Spurs’ Oliver Skipp was on the bench for the recent Premier League game against Cardiff City.Sixty of the best young talents in world football: Vinícius Júnior stands out from this year group – players born in 2000 – as he comes with that astonishing €45m price tag after Real Madrid signed him from Flamengo. He missed out on a place in Brazil’s World Cup squad but impressed on loan back at Flamengo before moving to Spain in the summer. The Argentinian Benjamín Garré is impressing at Manchester City, while Bayern Munich made Alphonso Davies the most expensive Canadian ever when they signed him from Vancouver Whitecaps. Yacine Adli, meanwhile, turned down a move to Arsenal and has made his Ligue 1 debut for PSG."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba2407733492e0fe0a1d4f782f91b381047e471c/0_192_4123_2474/master/4123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=389d7bcccba50066f748d964a05f3393","title":"england v australia women international football friendly live matildas","story":"75 min: And that’s Kirby’s last bit of action. Neville brings the experienced Williams on for Kirby. She will play in a deeper role. Perhaps Neville wants to make sure his team stay in control and don’t end up drawing a game they should be winning far more comfortably. 73 min: A lovely one-two between the lively Nobbs and Kirby frees the England striker in the box but Catley races in front of Kirby and snuffs out the danger as the forward attempts to unload a shot.71 min: For all England’s dominant play, Phil Neville will probably be a bit miffed that his side haven’t put this game out of sight. He wanted them to be ruthless. Australia win a free-kick on the right. One decent delivery and it could be 1-1. England defend it well though. 67 min: Parris tests Arnold with a sneaky snap-shot towards the keeper’s near-post but the keeper is smart and equal to it. And then Bronze gives the ball away at the back and invited Fowler to wallop a shot at goal from 20 yards that rises over the bar. Fowler is only the fifth youngest Matilda of all time. Blimey. 65 min: Australia changes. Ibini, who has had Australia’s best chance, is off and Crummer is on. And Der Vanna is replaced by Fowler. Fowler is 15. F-I-F-T-E-E-N! 64 min: Daly doesn’t hang around. She races into the box to get her head on to an inviting in-swinger from Bronze and finds the roof of the net. A moment later she nips in to the near-post and attempts an audacious right-footed back heel that’s jut a few inches over the bar. It was a brilliant delivery from the left by Greenwood. 63 min: That delightful pass was Mead’s last contribution. She’s been England’s best player in my humble opinion. She’s replaced by Parris. And Staniforth is brought off, with Daly coming on in her stead. 62 min: Mead angles a delicious right-footed pass in behind the Matildas defence for the onrushing Kirby. She rounds Arnold but her right footed shot at goal is snuffed out by Catley. Arnold did enough to force Kirby wide. The angle was against her.61 min: Australia win a corner. It’s knocked into the near post where a collection of bodies collide so that England can break. 60 min: England tiki-taka the ball around at the back for an age and draw the Australia defence up the pitch, which gives Bronze the chance to try and send Kirby through on goal with a dinked pass over the top from the back but Arnold is alert to it and beats Kirby to the ball at the edge of the box. 58 min: Mead has had a fine game. She has that lovely combination of lovely footwork and tenacity. If she doesn’t beat you with skill she’ll beat you somehow. She attempts to drift across the Australia backline to Duggan at the far post but it’s just overhit. 56 min: A change for the Matildas. Sayer is off and Gielnik is on.54 min: Mead dances around one defender and then tackles a second and hares away into the box but the referee blows for a foul. She’s unlucky there. It was a clean tackle. 52 min: Kirby races away on the inside-right channel and squares to Mead, but she can’t turn and get a shot away. 50 min: Australia are pressing England in midfield better than they did in the first half. They’re trying to stop England. But the hosts break and Duggan brings a fine save out of Arnold. 47 min: Ibini brings a fine save out of Earps after being put through on goal by De Vanna. The keeper uses her right foot to ert the ball out for a corner after rushing out to close down the angle. It followed a sloppy bit of play by Bronze, who got caught in possession as she tried to play out from the back. A warning sign that the Matildas are still a threat.45 min: Can the Matildas find a way back into this game? They give the ball away a couple of times early on in this half and gift possession back to England. They need to take better care of the ball if they are to.It’s almost time for the second half. England completely controlled the first but Australia did look like they had the pace on the break to trouble the hosts. One lapse in concentration at the back for England could be costly. Here’s some important half-time reading for you:And that’s that for now. England should really be winning by more than a single goal. They have been dominant and have had a few questionable refereeing decisions go against them. Back shortly. 45 min: England are denied a clear penalty. Mead’s slick footwork takes her past Foord, who sticks a leg out and brings her down. But nothing given. That’s incredible. A clearer penalty you’ll never see. 43 min: Staniforth thinks she has scored for England after Kirby squared when through on goal but the flag is up and offside is given. She was behind the ball when Kirby found her so she can’t have been offside. The only thing I can think is that offside was given against Kirby when Mead cleverly flicked the ball through for her. 41 min: England have settled back into their patient passing game. They win a free-kick around 35 yards from goal. Staniforth angles it towards the back post but it’s got too much zip on it and it drifts out for a goal-kick. 39 min: Houghton sends another header at goal after an England free-kick but Arnold’s safe hands deny her again. 35 min: Australia break and Ibini brings a smart low save out of Earps with a powerful right-footed drive. The teenage debutant has had a decent game.34 min: England win a corner. It’s a deep outswinger that Houghton wins with a towering header that she sends hurtling towards the top corner. But Arnold leaps and manages to get a hand to it. The ball drops at the feet of Mead but her right footed toe-poke is smothered on the line by Arnold. She thinks it is over the line. She has a case but there is no goalline technology so I guess we’ll never know whether it was or not. From a camera angle behind the goal it looks like half the ball crossed the line before it went out of sight as Arnold dropped on to it. 32 min: This is better from the Matildas. Ibini, who has had to do a lot of defending as she has tried to contain Greenwood, gets on the front foot and rinses the England left-back for pace before drilling a cross to the near-post, where Logarzo flings herself towards the ball but can’t get a clean connection.30 min: Sayer has another pop at goal from distance. It’s a decent hit from 25 yards but Earps gets her body behind it. Sayer is 16. What were you doing at 16? I bet you weren’t playing international football were you? 27 min: The Matildas have begun to keep hold of the ball and they’re working it into space between the lines and causing England some discomfort now. A smart interchange on the edge of the box between De Vanna and Sayer, sets up the latter for a left-footed effort at goal, but she is challenged just as she lets fly and the shot is robbed of any power and is saved easily.24 min: Kellond-Knight has a shot from distance but it takes a heavy deflection and is gathered comfortably by Earps. 23 min: This has been a dominant display from England. The build-from-the-back policy is working well. Australia aren’t seeing enough of the ball to hurt the hosts, whose passing has been inventive. That was coming but it came after some shocking defending from Australia. A loose back pass bounced in front of Arnold, who side-footed horribly straight to Mead. Mead squared cleverly to Kirby, who swivelled shr to send her marker the wrong way, before drilling home with her left foot from eight yards. 17 min: Mead is booked after taking out Logarzo with a wild challenge in midfield. She went right through her standing leg there. Oof! Thankfully Logarzo is OK. 16 min: Staniforth turns smartly in midfield and drives towards the Australia box. Kirby makes a zippy run down the inside-right channel but she is forced wide and Australia pick up possession. 13 min: England go close again after some intense pressing in midfield forces Australia to lose possession. Mead cuts inside on her left foot and tries to find the far corner with a low curling effort but it drifts wide by a few inches. 12 min: Arnold saves smartly after Staniforth has a pot-shot from range. 11 min: There’s a half-hearted penalty appeal from England when Kirby goes over under little contact in the box but it wasn’t a foul in my opinion. Australia can’t keep hold of the ball but they do look like they could be dangerous on the counter-attack. They have pace. 8 min: This has been a very lively start from the hosts. Greenwood pings a cross-field ball 40 yards into Bronze on the right. She takes a touch and drills a low cross in at Mead, who forces a smart save low to her right from Arnold with an inventive flick of the right heel. That was a lovely move. Before that the Matildas had their first shot on goal but Kellond-Knight’s effort was well wide from distance.6 min: Greenwood helps the ball forwards towards Kirby, who somehow flicks the ball on to Mead, who breaks forwards from midfield. Arnold races to the edge of the box to gather but can’t get there in time and Mead should really score as she lifts the ball over the keeper only to see it bounce wide of the open goal. 5 min: Duggan and Greenwood combine well on the left and the full-back races up to the by-line and crosses low towards Kirby, who can’t get round the ball to poke it on target at the near post. A bright move from England though. 3 min: England have started with impressive intensity. They’re pressing high up the pitch and looking to squeeze a mistake out of Australia’s backline. 1 min: We’re under way! England kick off and take possession. They immediately get on the front foot. Bronze curls a cross into the box from the right but the Matildas stand firm and clear.The teams trot out on to the Craven Cottage pitch. There’s a non-too-shabby crowd of around 6,000 in attendance on an unseasonably warm October night in London. The national anthems ring out, which means it’s almost time for football!Here’s what the England manager Phil Neville had to say in his pre-match interview on BT Sport: “The plan was to utilise the full squad tonight. The five players coming in will be tested and there will be three or four changes from the bench too. I think this Australia team will test us more than Brazil. I want us to be more ruthless in front of goal. The 1-0 scoreline flattered Brazil. Tonight I want us to put chances away. I want us to play with control and win in style. That’s the challenge I set them.”Of course, Australian football teams have form when it comes to humbling England in London. Isn’t that right Sven? Sven?The England team’s future looks bright if these talented prospects are anything to go by. Thanks to Suzanne Wrack for picking them out: I expect there will be a healthy contingent of Matildas fans at Craven Cottage tonight given the number of Australians who tend to land and stay in west London. One such fan has found a novel way to get to the match.England and Australia have met four times since they first played each other in 2003. England have won three and Australia just the one. The last times the two nations met was three years ago, in a friendly. England won 1-0. Phil Neville has made five changes to the England side that beat Brazil 1-0 on Saturday, with Chelsea goalkeeper Carly Telford replaced in goal by Wolfsburg’s Mary Earps. Amy Sayer and the brilliantly named Princess Ibini make their first starts for the Matildas while Elise Kellond-Knight brings the experience. The captain wins her 100th cap tonight.Hello. This is an intriguing game. The England manager, Phil Neville, believes the Matildas are “dark horses” for the World Cup in 2019 and offer his side a physical test similar to that of the USA, who were the last team to beat the home side, in March this year. The 1-0 victory over Brazil at Meadow Lane on Saturday stretched England’s unbeaten run to six games but they will have to work hard to keep that impressive record intact against tough opponents. There will be a couple of Ballon d’Or contenders on show at Craven Cottage tonight. England’s Lucy Bronze and Saturday’s match-winner Fran Kirby are on the 15-player shortlist for the inaugural award but sadly Australia’s sole nominee, the brilliant Sam Kerr, has not travelled with the squad to avoid burnout. It’s a pity, as without Kerr, the Matildas are a diminished attacking force. Australia were also without Alanna Kennedy, Lydia Williams and Emily van Egmond as they lost 2-0 against France last Friday and they’re expected to give some younger players another chance against England as they look to freshen up their options before the World Cup. Expect England to dominate possession against callow but hard-running opponents who may be dangerous on the counter-attack. I’ll have the team news shortly.

He frequently snapped at his wife and after working long hours, often retreated from his family with a “headache” so he didn’t have to deal with anyone’s noise or demands.Worried that his job stress would eventually destroy his marriage, Michael sought therapy with Boston psychologist Kalman Glantz, who encouraged him to look for concrete evidence that his work fears were warranted. But soon, he reported back that his superiors and co-workers had no real complaint with him and there was no actual threat to his job.Objectively, he was doing fine. However, in a treacherous economy that is increasingly inequitable, having strong self worth at work – which is where so many of us focus – has become almost impossible.In traditional cognitive therapy, a psychologist like Glantz would attempt to use discrepancies between a person’s perceptions and feelings and the reality of the situation in order to help them feel better about themselves. By learning to recognize that many fears aren’t based in fact – and directly addressing those that are —– patients can over time learn to reduce anxiety and depression, research shows.But Glantz took a different approach. He asked Michael why he even had an opinion about his status at all. Once Michael got over the weirdness of the question, the therapist worked to help him reconsider the idea of constantly worrying about whether he measured up.Inequality isn’t just changing the way we deal with economics – it’s perversely altering how we see ourselves and what we value. And Glantz and J Gary Bernhard, authors of the new book Self Evaluation and Psychotherapy in the Market System, want us to understand that.“What I would do is focus on the reality of the system which puts people in that kind of situation,” Glantz says of his work with Michael. “It has nothing to do with him.”Welcome to the new world of what might be called inequality therapy.In a hyper-capitalist world where advertising and financial pressures channel the drive for status into an obsession, no one can really win – even those who appear to have it all. Commerce infiltrates even the language we use to describe our deepest concerns: am I worth it? Am I valued? Do I count?This problem is exacerbated by the market system because, Glantz says, it values a particular type of identity, one based on “achievement rather than on belonging”.Inequality makes that harder to see as it unendingly promotes what psychologists call “materialistic values” that are harmful to mental and physical health. These involve prioritizing the pursuit of “money, status and image over things like family, spirituality, helping the community and just having fun”, says Tim Kasser, professor of psychology at Knox College and co-author of the book Hyper-capitalism: The Modern Economy, Its Values and How to Change Them.Kasser conducted a 2014 meta-analysis of hundreds of studies of materialistic values. Not a single one showed a positive relationship between material values and well-being. “The effect is almost always there and significant and basically always negative,” he says, noting that materialism is associated with less life satisfaction and happiness and more anxiety and depression. People who worry about status also drink more, smoke more and – natch – shop a hell of a lot more.Kasser notes that there are two important spurs for materialism, both of which are heightened by hyper-capitalism. The first is the most obvious: ads, movies, TV, other media, which constantly push consumerism. From the sociopathic level of consumerism exhibited by our current president and the reality show swamp from which he emerged to the Styles section of the New York Times, the trappings of wealth are exalted.But another, perhaps even more important factor, matters, too. And that is a sense of economic uncertainty, instability, precariousness or actual experience of low economic status. “When people grow up in a situation of threat or insecurity or are reminded of these things, they orient towards materialistic values,” Kasser says. Being deprived – or feeling that you soon will be – focuses the mind on money.And as we struggle to balance the need for love, friendship, family and financial security, hyper-capitalism weights the scales heavily in favor of putting gaining wealth first. We all know prioritizing relationships and values like compassion over money is healthier and more likely to lead to lasting happiness, but most of the messages we get suggest the opposite.For Michael, having permission to stop ruminating on his status helped break its hold over him. By observing the thoughts rather than engaging with their content, he began to gain distance from them. This – and some meditation and relaxation exercises – allowed him to be more attentive to his family. That broke the cycle of irritation and arguing that escalated stress. And by judging himself less, he became less judgmental about others.In the past, many therapies have had strongly political elements: consider the group therapies of the 1960s that urged people to liberate themselves from the restraints of the “straight” world or the 1970s “consciousness raising” of feminist psychotherapy. But as hyper-capitalism intensified through the 1980s, the focus narrowed almost exclusively to the self. This put the blunt of the blame for failure squarely on the inidual, even as the odds of rising economically and achieving the American dream fell sharply.As cases like Michael’s suggest, it is high time for an inequality therapy that doesn’t fault people for being crushed by an inhumane marketplace – but instead recognizes that it is the system, not the self, that is broken."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38429d425b105a5e3a23032e5c112ebfef31932b/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aee49aeeef1fa71e977fdb219d99648b","title":"age envy be happy everyone else perfect social media","story":"Social media has created a world in which everyone seems ecstatic – apart from us. Is there any way for people to curb their resentment?One night about five years ago, just before bed, I saw a tweet from a friend announcing how delighted he was to have been shortlisted for a journalism award. I felt my stomach lurch and my head spin, my teeth clench and my chest tighten. I did not sleep until the morning.Another five years or so before that, when I was at university, I was scrolling through the Facebook photos of someone on my course whom I vaguely knew. As I clicked on the pictures of her out clubbing with friends, drunkenly laughing, I felt my mood sink so fast I had to sit back in my chair. I seemed to stop breathing.I have thought about why these memories still haunt me from time to time – why they have not been forgotten along with most other day-to-day interactions I have had on social media – and I think it is because, in my 32 years, those are the most powerful and painful moments of envy I have experienced. I had not even entered that journalism competition, and I have never once been clubbing and enjoyed it, but as I read that tweet and as I scrolled through those photographs, I so desperately wanted what those people had that it left me as winded as if I had been punched in the stomach.We live in the age of envy. Career envy, kitchen envy, children envy, food envy, upper arm envy, holiday envy. You name it, there’s an envy for it. Human beings have always felt what Aristotle defined in the fourth century BC as pain at the sight of another’s good fortune, stirred by “those who have what we ought to have” – though it would be another thousand years before it would make it on to Pope Gregory’s list of the seven deadly sins.But with the advent of social media, says Ethan Kross, professor of psychology at the University of Michigan who studies the impact of Facebook on our wellbeing, “envy is being taken to an extreme”. We are constantly bombarded by “Photoshopped lives”, he says, “and that exerts a toll on us the likes of which we have never experienced in the history of our species. And it is not particularly pleasant.”Clinical psychologist Rachel Andrew says she is seeing more and more envy in her consulting room, from people who “can’t achieve the lifestyle they want but which they see others have”. Our use of platforms including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat, she says, amplifies this deeply disturbing psychological discord. “I think what social media has done is make everyone accessible for comparison,” she explains. “In the past, people might have just envied their neighbours, but now we can compare ourselves with everyone across the world.” Windy Dryden, one of the UK’s leading practitioners of cognitive behavioural therapy, calls this “comparisonitis”.And those comparisons are now much less realistic, Andrew continues: “We all know that images can be filtered, that people are presenting the very best take on their lives.” We carry our envy amplification device around in our pockets, we sleep with it next to our pillows, and it tempts us 24 hours a day, the moment we wake up, even if it is the middle of the night. Andrew has observed among her patients that knowing they are looking at an edited version of reality, the awareness that #nofilter is a deceitful hashtag, is no defence against the emotional force of envy. “What I notice is that most of us can intellectualise what we see on social media platforms – we know that these images and narratives that are presented aren’t real, we can talk about it and rationalise it – but on an emotional level, it’s still pushing buttons. If those images or narratives tap into what we aspire to, but what we don’t have, then it becomes very powerful.”To explore the role that envy plays in our use of social media, Kross and his team designed a study to consider the relationship between passive Facebook use – “just voyeuristically scrolling,” as he puts it – and envy and mood from moment to moment. Participants received texts five times a day for two weeks, asking about their passive Facebook use since the previous message, and how they were feeling in that moment. The results were striking, he says: “The more you’re on there scrolling away, the more that elicits feelings of envy, which in turn predicts drops in how good you feel”.No age group or social class is immune from envy, according to Andrew. In her consulting room she sees young women, self-conscious about how they look, who begin to follow certain accounts on Instagram to find hair inspiration or makeup techniques, and end up envying the women they follow and feeling even worse about themselves. But she also sees the same pattern among older businessmen and women who start out looking for strategies and tips on Twitter, and then struggle to accept what they find, which is that some people seem to be more successful than they are. “Equally, it can be friends and family who bring out those feelings of envy, around looks, lifestyle, careers and parenting – because somebody is always doing it better on social media,” she says. How much worse would it have been for Shakespeare’s Iago, who says of Cassio: “He hath a daily beauty in his life  That makes me ugly,” if he had been following his lieutenant on Instagram?While envying other people is damaging enough, “We have something even more pernicious, I think,” the renowned social psychologist Sherry Turkle tells me. “We look at the lives we have constructed online in which we only show the best of ourselves, and we feel a fear of missing out in relation to our own lives. We don’t measure up to the lives we tell others we are living, and we look at the self as though it were an other, and feel envious of it.” This creates an alienating sense of “self-envy” inside us, she says. “We feel inauthentic, curiously envious of our own avatars.”We gaze at our slimming, filtered #OutfitOfTheDay, and we want that body – not the one that feels tired and achy on the morning commute. We spit out the flavourless “edible” flowers that adorn our bircher muesli – not much of a #foodgasm in reality. We don’t know what to do with the useless inflatable unicorn when the Instagram Story has come to an end. While we are busy finding the perfect camera angle, our lives become a dazzling, flawless carapace, empty inside but for the envy of others and ourselves, in a world where black cats languish in animal shelters because they are not “selfie-friendly”.There is a different, even darker definition of the concept of envy. For Patricia Polledri, psychoanalytic psychotherapist and author of Envy in Everyday Life, the word refers to something quite dangerous, which can take the form of emotional abuse and violent acts of criminality. “Envy is wanting to destroy what someone else has. Not just wanting it for yourself, but wanting other people not to have it. It’s a deep-rooted issue, where you are very, very resentful of another person’s wellbeing – whether that be their looks, their position or the car they have. It is silent, destructive, underhand – it is pure malice, pure hatred,” she says.This can make it very difficult for envious people to seek and receive help, because it can feel impossible for them to take in something valuable from someone else, so strong is the urge to annihilate anything good in others and in themselves. She believes envy is not innate that it starts with an experience of early deprivation, when a mother cannot bond with her baby, and that child’s self-esteem is not nourished through his or her life.As a cognitive behavioural therapist, Dryden is less interested in the root causes of envy, focusing instead on what can be done about it. When it comes to the kind of envy inspired by social media, he says, there are two factors that make a person more vulnerable: low self-esteem and deprivation intolerance, which describes the experience of being unable to bear not getting what you want. To overcome this, he says, think about what you would teach a child. The aim is to develop a philosophy, a way of being in the world, that allows you to recognise when someone else has something that you want but don’t have, and also to recognise that you can survive without it, and that not having it does not make you less worthy or less of a person.We could also try to change the way we habitually use social media. Kross explains that most of the time, people use Facebook passively and not actively, idly and lazily reading instead of posting, messaging or commenting. “That is interesting when you realise it is the passive usage that is presumed to be more harmful than the active. The links between passive usage and feeling worse are very robust – we have huge data sets involving tens of thousands of people,” he says. While it is less clear how active usage affects wellbeing, there does seem to be a small positive link, he explains, between using Facebook to connect with others and feeling better.Perhaps, though, each of us also needs to think more carefully when we do use social media actively, about what we are trying to say and why – and how the curation of our online personas can contribute to this age of envy in which we live. When I was about to post on Facebook about some good career-related news recently, my husband asked me why I wanted to do that. I did not feel comfortable answering him, because the truth is it was out of vanity. Because I wanted the likes, the messages of congratulations, and perhaps, if I am brutally honest, I wanted others to know that I was doing well. I felt ashamed. There is nothing like an overly perceptive spouse to prick one’s ego.It is easy to justify publicising a promotion on Twitter as necessary for work, as a quick way of spreading the news to colleagues and peers. But as we type the words “Some personal news”, we could pause to ask ourselves, why are we doing this, really? Friends, family, colleagues – anyone who needs to know will find out soon enough with news that is quite personal, do we need to make it so public? Honing your personal brand on social media may seem good for business, but it does have a price. It all creates an atmosphere where showing off – whether unapologetically or deceptively – is not just normalised but expected, and that is a space where envy can flourish.I do not think the answer necessarily always lies in being more honest about our lives – it might sometimes lie in simply shutting up. Of course, raising awareness about previously hushed-up, devastating experiences of miscarriage or abuse or harassment can have the power to challenge stigma and change society. But ostensibly authentic posts about mindfulness, or sadness, or no makeup selfies are always designed to portray their poster in the best light.For Polledri’s concept of envy at its most noxious, there can be no upside. But as a less extreme emotional experience, it can serve a function in our lives. Dryden differentiates between unhealthy envy and its healthy form, which, he says, “can be creative”. Just as hunger tells us we need to eat, the feeling of envy, if we can listen to it in the right way, could show us what is missing from our lives that really matters to us, Kross explains. Andrew says: “It is about naming it as an emotion, knowing how it feels, and then not interpreting it as a positive or a negative, but trying to understand what it is telling you that you want. If that is achievable, you could take proper steps towards achieving it. But at the same time, ask yourself, what would be good enough?”When I reflect on those two moments of piercing envy that I cannot forget, I can see – once I have waded through the shame and embarrassment (so much for keeping the personal personal) – that they coincided with acute periods of unhappiness and insecurity. I was struggling to establish myself as a freelance writer and, before that, struggling to establish a social life after leaving home for university in a new city. Both of these things have improved as time has passed, but I do still feel unpleasant pangs of envy every now and then, whether I’m on social media or off it, and I see it among my friends and family. Perhaps in part it is because we do not know how to answer the question: “What would be good enough?” That is something I am still working on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e5f08d8167c5fabaf61d8744d3fda06f0e6886d/0_958_5784_3471/master/5784.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2e75145428c7ddf6f41729cf61a8cdc","title":"david bowie lower third bbc verdict documentary the first five years","story":"A new documentary reveals the scathing dismissal of the BBC Talent Selection Group on one of Bowie’s first groups, the Lower ThirdThe makers of a new BBC documentary about David Bowie’s early years as a musician have revealed the corporation’s dim view of his work at the time. In November 1965, his group the Lower Third failed their audition for the BBC’s Talent Selection Group, which was responsible for checking that any act angling for BBC radio play met their quality standards, the Times reports.One judge described Bowie – then known as Davy Jones – as “a singer devoid of personality”. Another said: “Singer not particularly exciting. Routines dull.” A third said: “I can’t find fault with them musically – but there is no entertainment in anything they do.” Bowie was described by one as an “amateur sounding vocalist who sings wrong notes and out of tune”.The Lower Third comprised Bowie, joined variously by guitarist Denis Taylor, bassist Graham Rivens, drummer Phil Lancaster and Tony Hatch on piano and background vocals. Their tracks Out of Sight, Baby That’s a Promise and a cover of Chim Chim Cher-ee from Mary Poppins were not deemed fit for public broadcast. One member of the panel expressed no hope for the group’s future: “I don’t think they’ll get better with more rehearsals.”The audition took place four years before Bowie found fame with his eponymous 1969 album and the single Space Oddity. While the BBC’s decision looks comic in retrospect, no Bowie aficionado would suggest that his mid-60s output contained much intimation of his future genius.The documentary, David Bowie: The First Five Years, will be shown on the BBC in 2019 to mark the 50th anniversary of Space Oddity. It features a clip of Phil Lancaster reading the audition report for the first time. The film concludes the BBC’s Bowie Five Years trilogy, directed by Francis Whately: The Last Five Years was broadcast in 2017, while Five Years, which focused on five key years in his career, was shown in 2013."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59b0463b1cf552a042364619bf64390b16b878e3/0_31_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ccd718143b59b00f3d05571edc63f36","title":"more than one third global music consumers pirate music","story":"Despite rise of legal streaming, a substantial number of listeners still rip music from sites such as YouTube for offline listening “Music piracy has disappeared from the media in the past few years but it certainly hasn’t gone away,” David Price, director of insight and analysis at IFPI, told the . “People still like free stuff, so it doesn’t surprise us that there are a lot of people engaged in this. And it’s relatively easy to pirate music, which is a difficult thing for us to say.”Stream-rippers told the IFPI that their primary motive was being able to listen to music offline without paying for a premium subscription to the likes of Spotify. Most legal subscription services charge around £10 a month to listen without adverts.The IFPI estimated that YouTube represented an annual revenue of less than $1 (76p) per user, compared to $20 (£15) on Spotify, and concluded that user upload services are not returning fair value to the music community.Price said that very little stream-ripping was happening on streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, and that these services could do little more to attract people towards paying for subscriptions: “There is no better way of consuming music, full stop. It is very difficult to imagine how they could become more user-friendly.” He instead put the blame on “the large video platforms like YouTube” for not doing enough to prevent piracy.“There are certain areas where they could improve on the security front, such as better encryption,” he said. Stream-ripping sites often involve simply entering a link from YouTube, with the sites then generating a free MP3 file from the link to illegally download. “There’s no way of giving sites a link from Spotify or Netflix and getting an immediate download, but you can do that for some of the large video platforms,” Price explained.“This is a game that is easy for a lot of these sites to play. It’s not like setting up a torrent site like the Pirate Bay, where you’ve got to collect all this content and curate it to some extent. You’re basically offering people access to music that is already uploaded elsewhere.”He also highlighted the importance of changing the law to emphasise the illegality of stream-ripping sites, and to make it more difficult for the sites to access revenue via advertising. Working in tandem with record labels, the IFPI helped close down one of the biggest stream-ripping sites, YouTube-MP3, in September 2017.Thirty-five percent of listeners who do not use a paid-for streaming service said everything they want to listen to was on YouTube.

The clue is in the title,” Foster said after a meeting with the EU’ chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. “I am a unionist, I believe in the union of the United Kingdom, all four elements of the United Kingdom. We do not want Northern Ireland going off in a different direction from the rest of the UK.”Talks on the Irish border are at a critical stage as the EU and UK seek to resolve their differences over the “backstop”, a fallback plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland in the absence of a solution through trade talks.The UK is no longer expected to publish a fresh version of its backstop proposal in the coming days. Expectations of a new text were raised after May promised last month that the UK would set out an alternative, but the government now appears to want to rework earlier proposals set out in June instead. Foster said she had not seen the government’s latest backstop text.The Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Tuesday he “categorically” ruled out the idea of the whole of the UK staying in a customs union indefinitely to avoid a hard border. The EU is unlikely to accept any proposal that is time-limited.Hopes that a Brexit deal will be landed at an EU summit next week further receded after the Irish deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, disclosed that a second summit in November was “probably needed”.Unveiling a €2bn budget programme to build Brexit resilience into Ireland’s economy, Coveney also said it was unlikely that the British backstop proposal would be published next week’s gathering.“I suspect the November meeting will probably be needed as well as October on that, but we will now more about that next Monday or Tuesday,” said Coveney. He said there was an “expectation that a deal would be secured” but said progress had been slower than expected during this week’s intense round of negotiations. The Dutch foreign minister, Stef Blok, told the  he believed the British position was confused and that the EU was united around a proposal put forward by Barnier for Northern Ireland alone to stay in the customs union.“I understood that the UK until now has used as a red line that it does not want a customs union,” Blok said. “This is one of the parts, from the EU side, where the difficulty often is that the UK either has red lines or is not very clear about its position. We are completely on the Irish side. We don’t want a hard border and there should be a backstop.”He said the Chequers proposals to seek frictionless trade with the EU were “not good enough”.“I think we have to be realistic,” he said. “Exiting the union, the common market, will mean there will be differences between the current situation and the future situation.”Blok said a number of financial services firms had made public that they would transfer at least part of their operations to continental Europe in light of the Brexit uncertainty. “I understand that Amsterdam will host quite a lot of specialised trading companies.”The EU is attempting to defuse the DUP’s concerns about a border in the Irish Sea by proposing to allow checks on goods to take place in factories, distribution centres and UK ports.Foster said she could not accept any checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, even if controls were far from the sea border. “Why would we need checks between GB and Northern Ireland, or between Northern Ireland and GB, if we were an integral part of the single market of the United Kingdom?” she said.She insisted her concerns were not only constitutional but aimed at averting damage to Northern Ireland’s economy by preventing the creation of barriers to intra-UK trade.Barnier has insisted the EU plans do not pose a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the DUP remains unconvinced. Foster insisted there was no binary choice between a hard border on the island of Ireland or a border down the Irish Sea. “Those are not the choices ahead of us. We are trying to find a deal that works for everyone.”She sought to defuse criticism of her remark that her red lines were “blood red”, saying she had meant that “these were issues that mattered greatly to Northern Ireland”.After the meeting, Barnier said on Twitter that he was “working hard to explain and de-dramatise the backstop”.Barnier had been scheduled to see Foster and the DUP MEP Diane Dodds for 30 minutes, although the meeting overran. He had a separate meeting with James Nicholson, the Ulster Unionist MEP.The European commission says the meetings are to provide updates and are not part of the official negotiations.In the last week Barnier has met British and Irish politicians on all sides of the Brexit argument, including the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b06a03734c54444de356f21ad5b8ddc03f38549e/819_373_3839_2303/master/3839.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e6869ab47e5dfe6ca3ac31e73196b6e","title":"calls to lower uk voting age as welsh assembly considers change","story":"Wales expected to follow example of Scotland in giving 16- and 17-year-olds the votePressure is growing on the UK government to consider giving 16- and 17-year-olds the vote, as the Welsh assembly prepares to debate the issue.The assembly in Cardiff is widely expected to back plans to lower the voting age in its elections, following the example set by Scotland.However, there are no plans for the Westminster government to give under-18s the vote in UK parliamentary elections or English local elections.In light of the expected developments in Wales, the Electoral Reform Society is challenging Theresa May’s government to create a “united franchise” across the UK.The campaign group’s chief executive, Darren Hughes, said: “Votes at 16 and 17 for the UK is now a matter of when not if. However, without reform soon, the United Kingdom will be desperately ided when it comes to the voting age and how we empower a new generation.The idea of lowering the age in Wales in time for the next assembly elections, in 2021, will be debated in Cardiff on Wednesday. The assembly’s presiding officer is seeking permission for the Welsh parliament and elections (Wales) bill, which includes the voting proposals, to be introduced. It is expected this will happen and a final vote on lowering the age is anticipated next year.Elin Jones, the presiding officer, said: “Empowering young people to vote at 16 is a powerful statement from the assembly that we value their views. Votes at 16 will have to be accompanied by appropriate political and citizenship education and public awareness-raising to ensure young people are encouraged and supported to exercise their right to vote.”Jess Blair, the director of the Electoral Reform Society Cymru, said: “Young people in Wales can soon have a real say on their future. Alongside wider reforms on how elections will work, Wales is leading the way in empowering a whole new generation of active citizens.“There is a widening gulf between people and politics, which we can help reverse by nurturing active and engaged young citizens. These plans to extend the franchise to 16- and 17-year-olds in Wales put Westminster’s dismal democratic record in sharp relief. Scotland and now Wales are modernising politics and promoting real civic engagement, inspiring young people to become active citizens. It’s time for the UK government to follow suit.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6252e793031eab48e022363a1ae1266c86cf395/0_10_1975_1185/master/1975.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41fc36edd4944a18427c7055d2c7c083","title":"ignorance is bliss for the brexit secretary","story":"Dominic Raab’s confidence that talks are going to plan crumbled under Labour questioningWho better to update the House of Commons on the progress of the Brexit negotiations following the informal EU summit in Salzburg than someone who wasn’t there? Not that ignorance has ever been a problem for Dominic Raab. The Brexit secretary is blessed with the supreme self-confidence of someone who isn’t aware of how little he actually knows so is always happy to listen to the sound of his own voice. In fact, there’s little in life he prefers.The negotiations were going totally to plan, Raab said. Apart from in one or two key areas that were proving trickier than expected. But all would be well provided we held our nerve and kept our less than 20-20 vision focus. The UK had put forward serious and credible proposals that had been roundly rejected by the EU and a majority of MPs and it was time for the EU to match our ambition and wishful thinking. And if the worst came to the worst, we’d crash out with a no deal because bankrupting the country was infinitely better than not bankrupting it.Keir Starmer has always responded to Raab with something approaching pity. The pity one lawyer might give to another whose job it is to defend the indefensible. Since the party conference break, the shadow Brexit secretary has added exasperation to his armoury. Was Raab aware there were only weeks left to agree a deal and that so far the government was no nearer to resolving the Northern Ireland backstop or what kind of future trading arrangements Britain would have with the EU? So could he please have some straight answers?He could. The straight answer was that there were no straight answers. Getting a deal by October had only ever been an aim. When he had said a deal would be reached by the October summit, he had never said which October he was talking about. So there. And he had never committed to signing up to a customs union as part of a Northern Ireland backstop. All he had promised was that Northern Ireland would remain in a temporary customs arrangement. Which was something entirely different. If Raab were ever to listen to a recording of himself he would die of embarrassment.On the plus side, Raab has a way to go before he is as deranged as some of the Tory Brexiters. Iain Duncan Smith demanded to know why the European Research Group’s paper on Northern Ireland that had been dismissed as unworkable by anyone who knew anything Northern Ireland wasn’t the government’s official position on Northern Ireland. John Redwood channelled his inner alien to insist that the Brexit idend would pay for everything if it was invested overseas. Or on another planet. Steve Baker was just Steve Baker. The stupid person’s Ayn Rand. Which is saying something.All the serious incoming flak came from the Labour benches. Hilary Benn wondered how Raab could claim the backstop could be time limited when the whole deal was predicated on the fact it would have to remain in place until such time a permanent solution was reached. Oh, said a bewildered Raab. Couldn’t it somehow be both temporary and infinite? Like the universe. You just had to get used to the idea of a 10-dimensional space-time continuum. Or something.Raab also had no answer to whether he was ruling in or out applying common external tariffs. He sort of was and he sort of wasn’t. “It would give us the advantages of those things we want to take advantage of,” he explained. By now it was even beginning to dawn on Raab – no small thing for a man of his intellectual self-regard – that he was being made to sound like a simpleton and he responded by getting angry. A vein in his temple started throbbing and his answers became increasingly snappy and tetchy.Labour carried on applying the pressure. Just how little detail did Raab imagine he would have to give for the government not to commit to a blind Brexit? Raab didn’t rightly know, but felt sure it was best to keep things definitely vague. As so often we were back to a variation of Schrodinger’s Brexit, where everything could simultaneously mean something and nothing. If we are slowly edging towards a Brexit deal, it will be in spite of rather than because of the Brexit secretary’s best efforts. An achievement of sorts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d29623dc7e214f66dbf70143f7ba4a2197758e50/88_47_2363_1418/master/2363.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=252bca9914688d40cccb0be2130b005c","title":"brexit international aid secretary penny mordaunt refuses to explicitly back mays chequers plan politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Dominic Raab’s statement to MPs about developments in the Brexit talksThat’s all from me for today.Thanks for the comments.The Conservative party has got back to me with a response to what Hillary Clinton said about Tory MEPs voting against a move to censure Hungary in the European parliament. (See 12.09pm.) A party spokesperson said:This was a decision made by MEPs because the parliamentary resolution was a highly ineffective way of dealing with the situation in Hungary.Orban has a track record of responding to legal measures led by the commission, not political moves in the parliament. The parliamentary motion at this stage undermines any future legal action, while boosting Orban’s domestic support.We will address concerns we have with the Hungarian government using the most effective routes.Labour’s Lilian Greenwood asks why the government is prepared to contemplate leaving the EU with no deal, but not staying in the customs union.Raab says staying in the customs union would not honour the result of the referendum.Labour’s Stephen Timms says Michel Barnier told the Brexit committee why Chequers was unacceptable. The committee published the transcript. So why did Theresa May claim not to know about the objections?Raab says, in a negotiation, if you work up plans, you don’t just abandon them at the first sign of objection.Labour’s Clive Efford asks Raab to confirm that whatever is voted on will be based on Chequers.Raab says the government will continue to chart a course based on its white paper proposals.Marcus Fysh, a Conservative, asks when the government will publish its latest backstop plan.Raab says the government has been clear about its policy.Andrew Bridgen says the UK and the Irish government will not enforce a hard border in Ireland, and neither will allow the EU to impose one.Raab says Bridgen is right about the UK position. But the UK does want a deal to cover this issue, he says.The Independent’s Shehab Khan has identified the key problem thrown up by this statement.Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister and vice chair of the European Research Group, asks Raab to accept that there are non-backstop solutions to the Irish border problem.Raab says Baker should know, because he was in government, that that would be unacceptable to the EU.

Will the “meaningful vote” motion include precise information about the future relationship?Raab says the government wants to ensure that MPs have enough information to make a proper choice.Labour’s Liz Kendall asks if No 10 was right to say yesterday that there would have to be a “precise” agreement on the future trade relationship for there to be a withdrawal agreement. Right or wrong?Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, says it is “rubbish” to say a backstop would be required to avoid the return of a hard border after Brexit. He says the DUP will not tolerate anything that separates Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK in terms of customs or the single market.Raab says the government will honour all the commitments it made in December. It will not do anything that would threaten the integrity of the UK.Owen Paterson, the Tory Brexiter, asks what incentive the EU would have to end a backstop that kept the UK in a customs union effectively.Raab says free movement would not apply. So the EU would have an incentive to end it, he says.Labour’s Luciana Berger asks if “frictionless trade” will be a condition in the withdrawal agreement.Raab says that is what the UK wants."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a940fea8213353c04bc2855a431c1ac942dbf3f/0_190_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a8959bcbbba59b018f7900928f9d38a","title":"virgin galactic space flight vss unity go weeks not months","story":" Richard Branson commits to SpaceShipTwo VSS Unity flight beyond Earth’s atmosphereVirgin Galactic will take its first trip into space within weeks according to Richard Branson, the firm’s billionaire chief and founder.The feat would mark a milestone for the company which is in a race against Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX to offer space flights to wealthy would-be astronauts.The entrepreneur added that he hoped to be onboard an early Virgin Galactic flight “in months not years”, with passengers willing to part with $250,000 (£192,000) taking their seats “not too long after that.”Branson, who founded Virgin Galactic in 2004, originally promised suborbital flights – those that reach space without orbiting the planet – by 2009. But the firm’s plans have been delayed by numerous setbacks and the loss of the company’s previous space plane in a 2014 accident that killed co-pilot Michael Alsbury.Test pilots have been putting the SpaceShipTwo craft, VSS Unity, through its paces high above the Mojave desert in California. In the most recent test in July, the space plane was released from its jet-powered carrier aircraft, VMS Eve, at 46,500 feet before the Unity’s pilots lit its rocket. The 42-second burn blasted it to 171,000 feet, nearly five times the cruising altitude of a transatlantic passenger plane. Its top speed was logged at Mach 2.47.To reach space, the pilots must take the Unity higher still. The upper atmosphere is generally regarded to give way to space at an altitude of 62 miles (100km), nearly twice the altitude achieved in the July test flight.Branson has had astronaut, fitness and centrifuge training to prepare himself for his trip into space. Asked in the interview whether he was confident enough people would pay for tickets, he told CNBC: “If I have a room full of 10 people, eight out of 10 would love to go to space if they could afford it.”“I think the market for people who would love to become astronauts and go to space is gigantic. And it is up to us to produce as many spaceships as we can to cater to that demand,” he added. The ticket price could ultimately fall to $50,000, he said.Virgin Galactic is not the only firm that hopes to make a business out of space tourism. In April, Bob Smith, the head of Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origins space company, told CNBC the firm still hoped to send tourists to the edge of space by the end of the year. Meanwhile Elon Musk of SpaceX has announced plans to send a passenger around the moon in 2023.SpaceShipTwo was designed to carry six passengers to the edge of space at an altitude of at least 50 miles. After a minute-long rocket burn, the rocket plane would continue its upward trajectory and then fall back to Earth, giving passengers time to float freely for a brief spell, and see the curvature of the Earth. Commercial flights will take off from a spaceport in New Mexico. In July, the UK Space Agency announced a £2.5m grant for the construction of a spaceport on the northern coast of Scotland after it was judged to be a prime site from which to lob satellites into orbit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41aa733cd28ea988d7060d0719abf99112d61534/0_0_2625_3500/master/2625.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8f025f493a8580ff2b5dbe01e381955d 2020w","title":"kenneth olisa social mobility raise childrens aspirations","story":"Improving social mobility may sometimes seem like an uphill task in a time of rising inequality but Sir Kenneth Olisa, chair of the judging panel for the second year running at the UK Social Mobility awards which take place next week, says this is all the more reason to focus on levelling the playing field.The 66-year-old, who was knighted in 2018 for services to business and philanthropy, has had a string of roles from running his own merchant bank to lord-lieutenant of Greater London. In 2016 he was named by Powerlist as  the most influential black man in Britain. Olisa argues that creating better opportunities for people from disadvantaged backgrounds like his should be a priority, including for business. People will tell you social mobility is a great idea, he says, “but just saying that and then not doing anything about it isn’t helpful.His own background – state-educated child of mixed race brought up by a single mother (his Nigerian father left while he was still young) in the 1950s, who went on to Cambridge – has informed his desire to promote inclusion and mobility. So, how does he respond to figures published last month showing that more than 14 million people live in poverty or research by the OECD showing that, far from improving, social mobility in the UK has stagnated?“I don’t consider that social mobility is a question of relative poverty andor earnings power. Earning more money isn’t a measure of social mobility, it’s a measure of earnings. You don’t have to be a high earner to have improved your social standing, indeed many important roles in our society, such as magistrates, aren’t paid,” says Olisa.The Social Mobility awards, set up by Tunde Banjoko, founder of the Making the Leap charity in 2017, are intended to incentivise organisations to break new ground in opening up opportunity. The commercial logic for having mobility as a target is clear, Olisa argues: finding the best talent is ultimately good for competitive advantage and the bottom line. “If you’re going to have a national football team you go to find the best football players. You don’t say, well let’s have people whose parents play football or who knows somebody that I know.” Most sports “dig deep into the talent pool” (at least at participant level) while business “is way behind that”.Asked if awards aren’t just tinkering around the edges of a big problem, he says that a major reason they are useful is the emphasis on organisations being able not only to demonstrate that they have strategies in place to widen the pool of talent they recruit from but also a plan for developing talent. Breaking down barriers by fostering ‘soft skills’ such as networking are also a way businesses can drive change he says.“Even now, if you went to a great public school and Oxford or Cambridge you’ve got a higher chance of getting into a top job than if you didn’t. And that isn’t a meaningful filter in the 21st century.”What about the government’s Social Mobility Commission? “I don’t quite understand what went wrong within the Social Mobility Commission but I very rarely heard anything from them,” he says. “They didn’t really say very much. They were all about data.” Asked whether he thinks the government is committed to fairness and social mobility, he replies: “Yes. But the answer doesn’t lie with legislators or regulators,” suggesting rather that, “it’s a matter of Darwinian principle that those who wish to survive and prosper will need to hire talented people from wherever they originate and not just people ‘who look like me’” .Olisa says that until his late 50s he would have said the colour of his skin was irrelevant. Only then did he realise the value of being a role model, not least for young people from minority ethnic backgrounds.Lives: London and Briantspuddle, Dorset.Family: Married, with two daughtersEducation: High Pavement grammar school, Nottingham Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge (MA natural, social and political and management sciences).Career: 2006 – present: founding chairman, Restoration Partners 1993 – 2006: founding chairman, Interregnum plc 1981 – 1993: various senior marketing roles, Wang Labs UK 1974-1980: engineer, then salesman, then product marketing manager, IBM Systems.Interests: Photography, skiing, watching the River Piddle flow past the garden."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30f768d902a7ea35a143b516c52c79db5ecf1cc1/52_63_3286_1972/master/3286.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=020e85abd5c06434c994e34b76bec1ec","title":"alex hales signs bangladesh premier league","story":"Alex Hales is braced for criticism after agreeing to play in the Bangladesh Premier League some two years on from declining to tour the country with England on security grounds.Hales controversially pulled out of the 2016 one-day series along with Eoin Morgan, the captain, but the  understands he has now signed a lucrative two-year deal to play for Rangpur Riders in the sixth edition of the BPL that begins in January. The 29-year-old batsman, who is with the England limited-overs squad currently touring Sri Lanka, renegotiated a white-ball deal with Nottinghamshire at the start of the recent county season in a bid to make himself available for the world’s Twenty20 tournaments.Having played this year under Tom Moody, the head coach of Indian Premier League side Sunrisers Hyderabad, Hales is now set to be reunited with the Australian in the BPL, where he will open alongside the West Indian left-hander Chris Gayle.The deal will inevitably draw criticism from those who took umbrage at Hales sitting out England’s last tour to Bangladesh following the Dhaka terrorist attacks in 2016. The right-hander is said to have been reassured by that tour passing without incident, while he has also taken advice from the tournament organisers and independent security professionals.One complication for him could arise from the impending hearing by the Cricket Disciplinary Commission in early December, however, with Hales having been referred to the panel by the England and Wales Cricket Board following the street fight in Bristol in September last year that resulted in his teammate, Ben Stokes, being found not guilty of affray.Hales and Stokes face two charges of bringing the game into disrepute and the CDC panel – which is funded by the ECB – has the power to impose cricketing sanctions that include fines and possible suspensions.The latter, if handed down, will likely take into account matches already missed.

Getting locked out of his flat naked. Turning violent. Tom Adams’ nocturnal behaviour is so unpredictable that he made a show about it with his partner Ten years ago, my wife, Lillian, and I shared a bed for the first time. At about 1am that night, Lillian heard me say in my sleep: “I want to get in a wardrobe and take you to Elephant and Castle.” About five minutes later, I sat upright and shouted: “Fuck you! No! No!” Lillian says she was quite alarmed.Over the 10 years of our relationship so far, I have said and done many more things in my sleep. Things that are funny, surreal and dangerous. These include: urinating into a bin. (Lillian asked me what I was doing. I turned around and said: “Stop pissing about Lill.”) Turning over and saying: “No, not like that, Mum.” Hitting Lillian.Right from the start, Lillian knew that the nocturnal part of our relationship would be different and need some care.Every night, I sleep talk. About once a month I sleepwalk. Lillian and I go to bed together and we never know what is going to happen in the night. I have said in the past: “Erm, can I have a potato? ... No, just one thanks.” I have thrown our duvet out of the top ﬂoor window. I have locked myself out of our ﬂat. All completely asleep. And all completely naked. Lillian and I do sleep naked. Perhaps I should rethink my nightwear.Lillian and I are both performers and composers. (She is associate composer with the theatre company 1927.) For fun’s sake, we thought we’d record the things I say and do on an app called Sleep Talk. Over three years, we collected 300 recordings of me and Lillian at night in different states. On some, you can hear me terriﬁed and Lillian waking up having to care for me. “It’s alright Tommy. You’re alright. It’s me, Lill.”Three years later, Lillian and I are touring a gig-theatre show called Elephant and Castle to venues nationwide. Originally, I thought the audio recordings would be the basis for my next solo show. But talking about it with Lillian, we felt that working together would bring another perspective to the story: Lillian’s. She is the one who has to wake up and deal with her unconscious husband shouting or pushing her about.From the start of devising together, we knew we wanted to use our musical skills (Lillian on piano, me on electric guitar) and vocals with lovely harmonies. And we wanted to show an honest, intimate, vulnerable, funny portrayal of our relationship on stage via sleep-talking and sleepwalking. We concentrated on how it all happened, from that ﬁrst night shock, to her sleep-deprived frustration, and to an eventual sense of compassion for one another. Songs and music came out of that.There were arguments between us as we made it. We found out quickly that we both work differently. In rehearsals, I make lots and lots quickly and then polish after that. Lillian prefers to work methodically and carefully on one song. It’s strange. We don’t argue much outside of our working life.But at night, when we’re asleep, might the things I do and say be connected to how I feel about Lillian? I hope not. We saw a sleep specialist, and he mentioned that the time I have a parasomnia – 1am – is signiﬁcant. It’s the time of my deepest sleep, when I’m “Primitive Tom”, he told me, “not Witty Tom”. I remember Lillian laughing hysterically when he said that.It being the ﬁrst time Lillian and I worked together, and with such personal subject matter, we didn’t know where the boundaries were. I am not sure we do now. But I love being on stage with my talented wife. I can look over while performing and relax. We are telling a simple, honest story of two people and how they cope. We can talk about it openly with each other and with audiences. Post-show Q\u0026ampAs are always fun as the performance gets people thinking about their own sleep lives.

Find out who makes the gradeTime’s up! I’m intrigued by these, would love to know what the meringue tastes like. Kim-Joy’s meringues look a bit sad and there isn’t enough fruit. Rahul’s looks far more indulgent and has the right texture. Jon’s was lazy with piping and his cream is too runny. Briony’s meringue has lost definition, but Ruby’s looks much better - good flavour and nice filling too. Manon’s meringues look lovely and is cooked well too - very nice.Jon doesn’t know how to decorate his pavlova, because decorating isn’t his thing. You’re on Bake Off hun, decorating REALLY needs to be your thing.The bottom has fallen off Kim-Joy’s meringue, and Ruby has declared that vegan white chocolate ‘tastes like chocolate’. To be fair, white chocolate is mostly sugar, is there actually any milk solids in it?Ruby is talking like a woman who makes meringues with aquafaba all the time. I guess it’s a good use of the chickpea juice you normally chuck down the sink.So instead of cream, it’s coconut milk and cornflour. The problem with coconut milk is it tastes of coconut, which has absolutely no business being in a pavlova.So the merigue is made with aquafaba, which is the liquid of cooked chickpeas. Sounds like something I’d clean the loo with, but let’s go with it. One whipped, it looks like meringue and pipes nicely. Jon is squishing it around like a man who is still absolutely livid about Vegan Week. Technical time! What fresh hell will this be? It’s one of Prue’s recipe, for a vegan tropical fruit pavlova.OK so this is fascinating - meringue without eggs, filling without cream...wouldn’t have a clue where to start.Kim-Joy gets a thumbs up for her squirrel tarts, and the tofu tarts are declared excellent. Paul gives her a vegan handshake, which is less meatybuttery than previous handshakes. Jon ran out of filling, and time. His pastry is rubbery and the flavours aren’t very nice. The falafel tartlets are ‘not bad’. Jon is not in any way embracing vegan week and he doesn’t care who knows it. Rahul’s tarts have lovely pastry but too much filling. Chickpea curry is one of my favourite things so I’d totally eat those - they look stunning. Judging time for the vegan tartlets. Manon’s summer tartlets look rather lovely, but the mushrooms look a bit grey. Prue and Paul declare both delicious, and coconut really works in the pastry. Ruby (who gets more beautiful by the week, incidentally), has made tarts that only taste of broccoli. Her sage tarts have got too much chilli going on.Five minutes left, and Rahul feels like maybe he should start assembling. Ruby is blowtorching the tomatoes on the top of her tarts, forgetting that she’s also blowtorching everything else. They actually look delicious.I love Kim-Joy’s squirrel tarts - they capture the spirit of roadkill, if not the flavour. You know how watching Bake Off usually makes us all really hungry? Right now I’m just sad.

The Strip must have more designer shops per square mile than London’s Chelsea or Mayfair. Caesars Palace’s Forum Shops are modestly billed as “the shopping wonder of the world”. The complex is a dizzying, Escher-like confabulation of Corinthian columns, balconies and domes, with a 227,000-litre aquarium thrown in for good measure. And if its 160 shops somehow fail to satisfy, just head across the road, where you’ll find the same number of high-class outlets at The Venetian – along with a recreation of La Serenissima’s Grand Canal, gondolas and all. One of the newest monuments to conspicuous consumption is The Shops at Crystals beside the Aria hotel. Designed by Daniel Libeskind, with interiors by the Rockwell Group and water features by Wet Design (which also created the Bellagio fountains), it has 50 luxury retailers, including the largest Louis Vuitton department store in the US and a two-storey Tiffany \u0026amp Co.In fact, every hotel and casino on the Strip has a shopping area – it’s a browser’s heaven, with just one catch: the labels in Las Vegas with the greatest cachet are European, so British visitors may find those more cheaply at home. With that in mind, you may be better off visiting the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood, a favourite hotel of Brits. This is less Gucci and more Urban Outfitters. It’s fun just to stroll in: the ceilings are a fake sky, painted blue with clouds, and the buildings are decked out like a Moorish bazaar, so you feel like you’re Indiana Jones in the Temple of Mammon.But even so, where, you ask, are the real bargains? Well, on the Strip, there’s one shopping mall that’s not part of any casino hotel – the Fashion Show opposite the Wynn. That’s where I pick up terrific $30 (£25) shirts on each trip in the frequent sales. Of the six department stores among its 247 outlets, Nordstrom usually seems to have the best deals on the best labels.

But if you’re undecided between the Bellagio or Caesars Palace, The Venetian or Wynn Las Vegas, this guide will help you make that callThere is a thriving Airbnb trade in Las Vegas, but unless you’re in a large group there’s really no need to consider it as an option. The hotel rooms are fantastic, plentiful and more affordable than in other major cities. Book late for the best deals (unless it’s a major convention or holiday weekend). There are resort fees and room taxes and be aware that weekends usually cost more than weeknights. When all I want is an inexpensive room in the heart of the Strip, my go-to hotels are Flamingo Las Vegas and the newer LINQ hotel and casino, because who ever sleeps in Las Vegas anyway? But if you want to stay in style, read on …BellagioAh, the Bellagio. Often considered the gold standard of Las Vegas hotels, Bellagio aspires to modern Italian sprezzatura, a certain graceful restraint, while its neighbouring rival, Caesars Palace, goes for ancient Roman grandeur. Its famous dancing fountains are one of the main attractions on the Strip. It has 12 restaurants, a gallery of fine art, and a purpose-built theatre to house the water-based Cirque du Soleil production O, which is still going strong after nearly 20 years. None of the elegant rooms is smaller than 510 sq ft. Caesars PalaceCaesars is the “daddy” of the Strip. Opened in 1966, it has survived long after many of its contemporaries have been reduced to rubble. Caesars promises the decadence and grandeur of imperial Rome (one of its suites is where, in The Hangover, Phil, Stu and Alan awake from a bachelor party to find a tiger in their room), but with enough modern innovations to keep ahead of the pack. In the past decade Caesars has undergone an estimated $1bn worth of renovations, including the world’s first Nobu boutique hotel, an extension of the famous Julius Tower and an addition of the 665-room Octavius Tower. Where other hotels have so-called presidential suites, this has an actual presidential suite – where Michelle and Barack Obama have stayed. It boasts a private cinema and a living room so large you hardly notice the grand piano in the far corner.Wynn Las VegasWynn Las Vegas and its sister hotel Encore breathe discreet elegance through every room, every restaurant, every bar and every nightclub. Ostentatiously, there is a huge 18-hole golf course out back, on prime Las Vegas real estate, although owner Steve Wynn recently announced plans to use some of that space to create Wynn Paradise Park in 2020, with a 15-hectare (38-acre) lagoon overlooked by a new 1,000-room hotel. The Cosmopolitan of Las VegasAs with Wynn, there is no theme to The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, no gimmicks. This newcomer to the Strip, opened in 2010, just concentrates on being effortlessly, inimitably stylish. I love the interiors by the Rockwell Group – one of a number of leading design firms marshalled to decorate the hotel – particularly the three-storey Chandelier Lounge, which swathes a spiral staircase, leading to three separate bars, in curtains of light. The rooms are sleek, modern, comfortable, with everything controlled at the touch of a button. Many have balconies – a rarity in Las Vegas. Ask for a north-facing room: the views of the Strip are peerless.Golden NuggetBefore the Strip was dreamed up, the Downtown area surrounding Fremont Street was the centre of Las Vegas. In many ways friendlier and more fun than the Strip, it was also very much the “land that style forgot” – until the Golden Nugget embarked on an ambitious $300m programme of upgrades in 2005. The new Rush Tower was introduced in 2009, although you may prefer to get a room in the recently renovated Gold Tower that looks out on to the Tank pool complex with its three-storey water slide and shark-filled aquarium. Mandarin OrientalThe epitome of understated luxury, the Mandarin Oriental is very much part of the new Las Vegas, a city that is constantly reinventing itself. None of the rooms is under 500 sq ft, the service is faultless and it has a restaurant by three-star Michelin chef Paul Gagnaire.MGM GrandGlowing with the same green as the Emerald City of Oz, the MGM Grand deserves its name: with nearly 7,000 rooms, it is the largest single hotel in the US. All were comprehensively renovated for a more contemporary feel at the beginning of the decade, taking a year to complete in total. It also has the hottest nightclub, Hakkasan, the finest restaurant, Joël Robuchon, and the biggest Las Vegas entertainment legend, David Copperfield. The MirageThe Mirage seems hardly to have changed since it opened in 1989. Granted, there are new bars and restaurants, there’s a terrific production of Beatles Love – recently revamped – and some of the rooms have been refurbed, but the essential structure and vibe remains the same. Given that it set the standard for modern Las Vegas hotels, that’s no bad thing: I’ve come back here again and again over the years. The showstopper is a gigantic central dome filled with lush tropical plants and tinkling water, with one of Las Vegas’s finest pools outside. It hardly needs the giant volcano at the front that erupts spectacularly twice a night, but hey! It’s Las Vegas! Why not have a volcano? Palms Casino ResortThe two tall towers of Palms are located a little way off the main Strip, which means it has to try that bit harder, and boy does it rise to the challenge. Catering to a young, well-heeled crowd, Palms also has some of the most over-the-top, rap-star-awesome suites you’ll find anywhere in the world. A bowling alley in your lounge? Certainly, that’ll be the Kingpin suite. Or perhaps you’d prefer a basketball court in your 10,000 sq ft lodgings? Hardwood suite for you.The Venetian and The PalazzoYou can’t not love The Venetian. Anywhere with elaborately painted ceilings, and gondoliers serenading loved-up couples from the canals on the first-floor shopping mall is all right by me. Although for a good night’s sleep I prefer the all-suite rooms in the affiliated Palazzo, added next door in 2007. Together, they made up the world’s largest hotel complex, until the First World Hotel in Malaysia trumped it in 2015. W Hotel at the SLSTotally rebuilt from the frame of the historic Rat Pack-era Sahara hotel, the SLS is breathing new life into the north end of the Strip. It’s a cab ride, not a walk, or you can take the monorail. One reason to make the detour is the W Hotel, which recently opened as a separate venture inside the SLS. It’s an oasis of quirky, hipsterish good taste, with a number of discreet design touches that echo its Sahara past. The elegant, calming rooms start at a Wonderful Room of 322 sq ft, through Spectacular to Fabulous at 490 sq ft, plus suites ranging from Marvellous through Mega to WOW. W Hotel guests can enjoy all the SLS facilities, including some of Las Vegas’s best new restaurants and the Foxtail pool and nightclub.To find out more about holidays in Las Vegas, check out visitlasvegas"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/feb72ad9c178462b55084ea910852ca85952e510/0_265_4675_2805/master/4675.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6805a1df9d6180027487cc7c52962426","title":"berlin startup offers 1m to save ancient hambach forest from coal mining","story":"Ecosia offers to buy remaining forest from energy firm RWE, which plans to fell most of the treesA non-profit Berlin tech startup has offered to buy the remaining 200 hectares of an ancient German forest to save it from being destroyed for coal surface mining.Ecosia, a search engine which donates the majority of its advertising revenue to conservation initiatives and funded the planting of almost 40m trees across the world, has approached the energy firm RWE with an offer of €1m (£877,000) to secure the final stretch of the 12,000-year-old Hambach forest in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia.“We think that a fair reconciliation of interests can be found between RWE and the people, and with our commitment to buy the remaining stretch, are pursuing the ecological and societal interests of those who have committed themselves to protecting the forest and dedicated themselves to nature conservation,” Christian Kroll, Ecosia’s CEO, wrote to the head of RWE, Rolf Martin Schmitz.Ecosia’s offer was unsolicited. RWE had not sought a buyer for the land, which is believed to have been bought in the 1970s for the equivalent of about €500,000 in today’s money.RWE has plans to cut down the majority of the forest, located close to Aachen, which activists have been fighting for years to save, with many holding out in fortress-style treehouses. In recent weeks tensions have heightened as thousands of protesters and police have confronted each other in lengthy standoffs and scores of treehouses have been destroyed. In one confrontation a journalist died after falling from a treehouse.About 50,000 demonstrators gathered in the forest for peaceful protests at the weekend, calling for it to be saved, and for the government to outlaw lignite, which is also known as brown coal, as an energy source and to accelerate its plans to phase out the country’s dependence on coal.Last Friday a regional court in Münster temporarily ordered RWE to stop felling the forest.Conservationists have urged a rethink of the country’s energy strategy, pointing out that energy companies are making huge profits – from an estimated €1.8bn in revenue – by exporting about 80 terawatts of energy to neighbouring countries.Kroll, who founded Ecosia in 2009, said his company had wanted to use the window of opportunity to place its bid, and was keen to stress it was not motivated by publicity.“Last year for the first time, Germany produced more renewable energy than brown coal energy, and this is the direction we need to keep working towards,” Kroll said. “There is a momentum here that we do not want to see lost and we invite other companies and organisations to join us in our offer for the Hambach forest.”Pieter van Midwoud, Ecosia’s tree-planting officer, highlighted the unusual nature of the Hambach forest, a broadleaf forest which used to typify most of Germany’s woodland but is now rarely seen. “Some of the trees in the Hambach forest are 350 years old and it is home to 13 endangered species,” Van Midwoud added.RWE failed to respond to the startup’s offer by Tuesday afternoon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b99e3198331aa028aaf8dc11da11dd12cead06f/0_48_4011_2407/master/4011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76244641ed4a94cc44abc4c274bf3c10","title":"calvin klein fragrance could be used lure man eating tiger","story":"Officials in India say Obsession cologne may help trap animal that has killed nine peopleWildlife authorities in India trying to catch a tiger thought to have killed at least nine people say they are considering the use of an unconventional weapon: Calvin Klein’s Obsession cologne.The six-year-old tiger, given the name T1, has been accused of preying on people in Pandharkawada, a town in Maharashtra state. Rangers have thrown significant resources into their attempts to capture the animal. One of five elephants brought in to try to corral the big cat reportedly went rogue last week and trampled through a nearby village, killing a woman.Sunil Limaye, a wildlife official involved in the hunt, said his team was still deciding whether to deploy the men’s fragrance, but it was an option.The power of Obsession to lure big cats was first established by experiments at Bronx zoo in New York in 2003. The key ingredient is a synthetic version of the musk secreted by the civet, a small nocturnal mammal whose glandular liquid is prized for its powerful aroma.Limaye said his team was still relying on camera traps, track marks, thermal drones and foot patrols, but would source the fragrance if those options failed.Animal rights activists lost a bid in the Indian supreme court last month to stop officials from killing the tiger. Obsession has been used to catch at least two other tigers in India.The perfume was first used in the country by HS Prayag, a senior veterinarian and former zookeeper who studies large carnivores.“In 2015 there was a man-eater in Tamil Nadu, and so I requested CK Obsession to lure the animal,” he said. “I also tried using tiger urine but CK gave me better results.”Chanel No 5 was also known to work, he said, “but because it is costly I use CK Obsession”.He said he advised officials hunting big cats to try spraying the perfume on their camera traps. “But I always have a word of caution,” he added. “Please use the original Calvin Klein perfume, not the one you buy in the market, because I don’t think they’re original.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/466b63bae5bf391def355cd9cd0352e0e764d490/0_61_2126_1276/master/2126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62ebd3c498b8860aeb33cee63c282de2","title":"hurricane michael florida panhandle","story":"Hurricane Michael continued to plow through the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday, towards a potentially catastrophic landfall along the Florida Panhandle, where tens of thousands of people were scrambling to flee its deadly path.With maximum sustained winds expected to reach 125mph by its arrival on Wednesday, according to the National Hurricane Centre (NHC) in Miami, Governor Rick Scott said Michael was expected to be “the most destructive storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in decades”.The storm has claimed at least 13 lives during its northerly march through the western Caribbean and Central America and it powered up further in the warm waters of the Gulf on Tuesday, to menace Florida’s coastline only 5mph short of category four status. A storm of that magnitude would devastate large areas and leave homes without power for weeks.Authorities warned the 120,000 residents of coastal and low-lying areas under a mandatory evacuation order that time was running out.“Please evacuate now,” the Bay county sheriff, Tommy Ford, said, warning of a storm surge of up to 12ft that would completely engulf many waterfront properties. “I can’t stress strongly enough the importance of leaving as early as possible. Evacuation routes can quickly turn into traffic nightmares.”He said residents “would not be dragged from their houses” but made clear that any who chose to stay would be on their own.Officials including President Donald Trump, Scott and Andrew Gillum, the Tallahassee mayor aiming to become governor in next month’s election, all urged citizens not to underestimate the storm.“Today it is about life and safety,” Gillum said as he helped city residents fill sandbags for flood defences on Monday. “There’s nothing between us and this storm but warm water, and I think that’s what terrifies us about the potential impacts.”Speaking at an emergency management briefing on Tuesday morning, Scott, who declared a state of emergency in 35 of Florida’s 67 counties from the Panhandle to Tampa Bay, said the forecast “keeps getting more dangerous. This storm will be life-threatening and extremely dangerous.”At the White House, Trump told reporters: “We have another one coming, a big one, much bigger than they anticipated a week ago. I heard the first time it was a very small drop of weather.”The federal government, he said, was “very well-prepared”.According to the NHC, the centre of Michael was just 360 miles south of Panama City Beach at 11am on Tuesday and moving north at 12mph. The storm’s maximum sustained winds had climbed to 110mph after sucking heat from the Gulf waters, the NHC said, with hurricane force winds extending 35 miles from its core. Forecasters predicted further strengthening was likely to occur before Michael made landfall around lunchtime on Wednesday, as a category three or four hurricane.Parts of Florida’s marshy, lightly populated Big Bend area could see up to 12ft of storm surge. Michael also could dump up to a foot of rain over some Panhandle communities.In western Cuba, Michael triggered flash floods and mudslides in mountain areas. Disaster agencies in El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua reported 13 deaths as roofs collapsed and residents were carried away by swollen rivers. Six people died in Honduras, four in Nicaragua and three in El Salvador. Authorities were searching for a boy swept away by a river in Guatemala. Heavy rains swamped the region at the weekend after Michael formed of the coast of Honduras.Scott activated hundreds of national guard members and waived tolls to encourage evacuations. He also warned caregivers at north Florida hospitals and nursing homes to do all possible to assure the safety of the elderly and infirm. Following Hurricane Irma last year, 14 people died when a south Florida nursing home lost power and air conditioning.“If you’re responsible for a patient, you’re responsible for the patient. Take care of them,” Scott said.Sheriff David Morgan of Escambia county bluntly advised residents choosing to ride it out that first-responders would not be able to reach them while Michael hits the coast.“If you decide to stay in your home and a tree falls on your house or the storm surge catches you and you’re now calling for help, there’s no one that can respond to help you,” Morgan said.In the small city of Apalachicola, Mayor Van Johnson Sr said 2,300 residents were frantically preparing for what could be a strike unlike any seen there in decades. Many filled sandbags and boarded up homes and lined up to buy gas and groceries before leaving town.No shelters will be open in Wakulla county, the sheriff’s office warned on Facebook, because they are rated safe only for hurricanes with sustained winds below 111mph. With Michael’s winds projected to be even stronger, residents were urged to evacuate inland.“This storm has the potential to be a historic storm, please take heed,” the sheriff’s office said in the post.The entire neighboring state of Alabama is under an emergency declaration. Governor Kay Ivey said she feared widespread power outages and other problems would follow. Forecasters warned spinoff tornadoes would also be a threat.Speaking in Orlando on Monday, Trump said he had made federal resources available to authorities in Florida.“As Hurricane Michael nears landfall we are working with state and local officials to take all necessary precautions. I told Rick Scott that we are ready for you. Looks like another big one, but we’ve handled them well,” the president said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d81eb1bf812032254221e6b4083bd1ad3493686/357_77_2730_1638/master/2730.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f409577e4f3bab29938d6bbf459be3b","title":"i had a moral duty whistleblowers on why they spoke up","story":"They took on warmongers, sexual abuse and tax dodgers. Would they do it again?by Teri Pengilley,  Christopher Thomond ,  Murdo MacLeod,  Sarah Lee and words by Caitlin DiskenIn an age where information is tightly controlled by image-makers, spin doctors and gatekeepers, real scandal can often only be revealed with the help of whistleblowers.To mark the 25th anniversary of the whistleblowing charity Protect (formerly known as Public Concern at Work) – we focus on 12 people who have taken great personal risk to expose everything from warmongers to tax dodgers and sexual and physical abuse.“I could have been fined a million euros,” the Luxleaks whistleblower Antoine Deltour says when reflecting on his ordeal. Since passing information about controversial tax agreements to the French journalist Edouard Perrin, the former PricewaterhouseCoopers employee has faced global media attention and two trials. By 2016, more than 215,000 people had signed a petition pledging support for Deltour.It was in 2011 that Deltour first passed documents to Perrin, detailing how companies such as Amazon and Dyson struck (perfectly legal) deals with Luxembourg to avoid cross-border tax. The International Consortium of Journalists used this leaked data to unveil the extent of the tax avoidance in 2014. Many of the multinational companies involved had managed to reduce their tax to near zero by developing complex strategies with the Grand Duchy.The data leak was denounced by Pierre Gramegna, Luxembourg’s finance minister, as “the worst attack” ever experienced by his country. Indeed, Deltour grimly acknowledges the immense courage needed on his part. In 2016, he was convicted of theft, receiving a 12-month suspended sentence and a fine of €1,500. Even so, he still insists he would whistleblow again.“Democracy demands information,” Deltour says. “I still believe I acted in the public interest.”In early 2018, Deltour was finally acknowledged as a whistleblower, and his conviction was quashed. But in what Deltour describes as a “smart move”, a €1,000 fine against Raphael Halet, who also passed Luxleaks information on, was upheld. “There’s a message there,” Deltour notes. “By recognising me, they’re making out that they’re open. But by condemning Raphael, they’re making sure people think twice before speaking to a journalist.”Katharine Gun was 28 when she tried to prevent one of the deadliest wars of the 21st century.Whilst working as a mandarin translator at GCHQ, Gun and her colleagues received a request from America’s National Security Agency. The email requested an intelligence “surge’ of diplomats attached to the UN security council, to secure crucial information on the voting intentions of member states in the run-up to the Iraq war.Gun, horrified at these “dirty-tricks”, leaked the email to the Observer, and was subsequently sacked and arrested, an ordeal which she describes as “isolating”. “I felt very much alone,” she says. “I didn’t know whether I would be charged.”Although her leak did not deter the war, it did cause worldwide outrage, and a second UN resolution to authorise the war never occurred. Gun’s trial collapsed due to insufficient evidence, and her whistleblowing is now being immortalised in upcoming film Official Secrets. Would she blow the whistle again? “Yeah, I would,” she says. “There is always a need for whistleblowers – we don’t live in a society which is transparent, fair and just. Whistleblowers hold people to account.”As a nurse with decades of experience, Terry Bryan was appalled by the abuse he witnessed at Winterbourne View, a hospital for people with learning difficulties. After his concerns were ignored by management, he raised his claims with the Care Quality Commission. In what the CQC described as an “unforgivable error of judgement”, no action was taken.Bryan then turned to BBC Panorama, whose show Undercover Care: The Abuse Exposed cast Winterbourne’s conditions into the limelight. Bryan’s whistleblowing led to six care workers being given prison sentences, and NHS England developing its 2011 “transforming care” agenda. The agenda aimed to reduce patient admissions to hospitals like Winterbourne.Bryan now works for Care Inspectorate Wales, using his experience to inspect care homes and nursing homes around South Wales. When asked if he would be prepared to blow the whistle again, it was an unequivocal yes. “It’s about following your conscience,” he says. “How would you live with yourself if you didn’t do it?”Awarded whistleblower of the year by Middlesex University in 2014, Osita Mba’s actions have been highly commended. In March 2011, the former HMRC solicitor contacted the National Audit Office, revealing a “sweetheart deal” between HMRC and the investment banking firm Goldman Sachs. Mba alleged that HMRC’s most senior tax official had let Goldman Sachs off paying at least £20m in interest. “I considered it my duty as a public servant to report it,” Mba reflects. After feeling unsatisfied with the NAO’s report in the matter, Mba then took the claims to the public accounts committee of the House of Commons. “Fortunately, my claims were taken seriously and investigated,” he says.In an action widely condemned by MPs, HMRC then used the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act to search through the phone records and emails of both Mba and his wife. “I expected them to do it, so I wasn’t surprised when I found out that they had,” says Mba, who was also suspended from his job. Despite his ordeal, he is able to see the positives: “I have paid dearly in terms of my career so far, but the peace of mind I have enjoyed is priceless.”In 2013, Mba received the equivalent of three years’ salary and pension contribution in a compromise agreement. Looking back, he describes whistleblowing as a “battle of conscience”. “Only the truth will set you free,” he says. “If I find myself in a situation where my conscience tells me that speaking out is the right thing to do, I will do it.”Claire Gilham was a district judge at Warrington county court when she first raised her complaints. Working in family courts, she witnessed hostage-taking and violence, and was even alerted by the police that someone was threatening to kill her. Initially, she was encouraged to speak out, but gradually support for her waned. Isolated and excluded, she recalls telling her human resources team: “I can’t stand this, I’m going to break down.”Gilham’s case remains unique among the other whistleblowers. Judges are not classed as workers, and so aren’t entitled to the legal protections usually given to whistleblowers. “I think it’s dangerous to exclude people from statutory protection,” Gilham says, when asked about her determination to take her case to the supreme court. It was previously dismissed by an employment tribunal and the appeals court, which upheld the ruling that judges are not workers.Working with Protect (formerly Public Concern at Work) throughout her case, Gilham remembers their ability to reflect critically on her case. “It was reassuring to find that whistleblowers aren’t crazy, resentful people,” Gilham adds. Rather, they are simply people unwilling to assist in the concealment of mistakes.“If judges, the most privileged people in the country, can’t speak out, then who can?” says Gilham, who feels a sense of responsibility for those less able to speak out. She is adamant that she would be prepared to blow the whistle again. “You have to reflect on what you’re doing and walk forward. You have to be ethical.”In a 2016 speech in the Lords discussing his whistleblowing experience, the Conservative peer Kevin Shinkwin described it as the saddest moment of his career. Does he still view it this way? “Yes, it still is the saddest moment,” he says. “It completely shattered my trust.”The incident in question happened in 2010, before Shinkwin entered the Lords and\u0026nbspwhen\u0026nbsphe\u0026nbspwas working, when Lord Shinkwin was working as the head of public affairs and communication at the Royal British Legion. He was asked to sign an invoice of £10,000 for work done by an MP’s researcher, who was using his privileged access as a passholder to moonlight as a public affairs consultant. Shinkwin\u0026nbspand his then boss both refused to sign it and\u0026nbsprecommended\u0026nbspit\u0026nbspshould not be paid.\u0026nbspThey were over-ruled by the then Director General who only informed them he had personally approved payment retrospectively. “The issue of trust was paramount,” he says. “People give money to charities in the good faith that it will be spent properly.” Although Shinkwin notes that there is no evidence the money was ever paid, he emphasises that the way he was treated for raising concerns is what matters. He was bullied by a senior director, who demanded that he approve the invoice. The then director general even led Shinkwin to believe a payment had been made. He says he was eventually eased out of his role at the Legion. “I knew that by speaking up, I was sacrificing my career,” he says.Shinkwin is keen to emphasise that the Royal British Legion is a different place today. “I don’t believe what happened to me would happen at the Legion now,” he says, noting\u0026nbspthat the Legion has a completely new senior management team.The past few months have been rough for Shahmir Sanni. Since March, he’s been alienated by those he trusted, fired from his job at the TaxPayers’ Alliance and outed as gay by Downing Street. All this stems from an interview published in the Observer – an interview in which Sanni alleged that the leave campaign broken campaign rules to win the Brexit vote..“I was traumatised,” says Sanni of the moment that a rival revealed his sexuality. “I thought, you know what, screw these guys. I realised I had a moral duty to bring light on each and every inidual. It was about justice for the British electorate, but also justice for LGBTQ+ people and people of colour, bigger than Brexit.”Sanni’s interview revealed that Vote Leave were close to exceeding their £7m spending budget. They received a donation of £1m a couple of weeks before the referendum that would have tipped them over. They decided to “donate” £625,000 to BeLeave, a youth group founded by Darren Grimes. Initially ecstatic, Sanni quickly realised they would never see any of the money. Instead, it was ploughed back into Vote Leave’s campaign.“What’s the point of democracy if you’re going to cheat?” asks Sanni, who still remains a committed Eurosceptic. “Justice comes when people are being investigated and fined.”When asked if he would blow the whistle again, Sanni is unsure. “Short answer: yes. But I do often say probably not.” Sanni advises those who have had any minor or major mental illness, particularly people of colour, to think twice before whistleblowing.“When you whistleblow as a minority, there are massive implications,” says Sanni, who recalls both Brexiters and remainers doubting his integrity. Despite this, he remains upbeat. When asked for a final statement, he jokes: “Follow me on Instagram.”Quickly becoming serious again, he is keen to emphasise the gravity of the situation. “It was a huge electoral scandal. It’s about more than Brexit now. It’s about ensuring that our democracy is retained.”When the media mogul Robert Maxwell died in 1991, he was mourned as the Daily Mirror’s “saviour”. Yet, in the wake of his death, a vast pension fraud was revealed. In all, some £400m was found to have been taken from the Mirror’s pension fund, leaving employees facing a bleak future. For Harry Templeton, who initially blew the whistle on this in 1988, the revelations came “too late”.Templeton, a printer for the Mirror Group newspapers, sat on the board of trustees for the Mirror’s pension scheme. A union-approved trustee, he challenged Maxwell about the way he planned to use the pension funds. In a vote about the scheme, Templeton found himself outnumbered 13-1. The seven management-approved trustees on the board wouldn’t dare vote against Maxwell, Templeton recalls. The six other union-approved trustees were simply “very naive”.“I had to bring my problems home to my family,” says Templeton, remembering his experience as demoralising. “It was like banging your head against a brick wall.”Shortly after, he was fired from the company under the pretext of threatening another worker. “You have to remember, companies don’t sack someone for blowing the whistle,” Templeton says. “They find other reasons to, and they offer people incentives to keep their mouths shut.”Templeton recognises the challenges that whistleblowers and their supporters face. “You have to try to do something about it, but the other side doesn’t stick to the rules, they find every method they can.”Howard Shaw, a former detective sergeant at the politan Police, describes his experience as a whistleblower as a “lonely two years”. Now chief compliance officer at Joules Africa, Shaw blew the whistle after alleging that a former colleague cheated in a job interview that led to his promotion.Shaw raised concerns with his superiors that the colleague had seen interview questions in advance. His claims were ignored and the inidual was then appointed as his line manager. Shaw was subsequently removed from his unit.“I was under the care of my doctor and on medication, I had counselling,” Shaw remembers. Unprepared to leave the unit quietly, Shaw brought the case to an employment tribunal, which awarded him £37,000 damages and £1,000 costs after finding that he did have legal protection as a whistleblower.Despite his success, Shaw says regrettably that he would not blow the whistle again, but instead calls for reform of whistleblowing laws. “The law needs to be more user-friendly, more accessible and less judicial.”Chris Day was a junior doctor on the way to becoming a consultant when his career progress was cut short. While working on a south London hospital’s intensive care unit, Day became increasingly concerned regarding staffing levels. “One of my principal disclosures was made in real time at the beginning of the night shift,” he remembers. “I had no choice – the consequences of not making the disclosure might have been even more scary.”Yet Day’s allegations had lifechanging consequences for him. His whistleblowing cost him his consultancy career and he has been working as a locum doctor in A\u0026ampE departments, while he fights his case.  Instead of acting on his safety concerns, Health Education England attempted to argue they were not his employer.“I don’t know why there is such resistance to culture change and meaningful legal protection for whistleblowers,” says Day, whose case has since succeeded, granting 54,000 junior doctors whistleblowing protection. “Maybe they think the public cannot cope with the truth about what is happening in the NHS.”Day remains a vocal supporter of the NHS, and he has since mounted campaigns to keep it public. Reflecting on his experience, he says: “I would only whistleblow again if a person’s life was in immediate danger. Politicians want healthcare staff to keep quiet and get on with the job.”From humble beginnings in Liverpool, Michael Woodford quickly rose through the ranks at digital camera company Olympus, before becoming the company’s first non-Japanese president in 2011. Just weeks later he became suspicious of several acquisitions the company had made in what turned out to be a £1bn fraud scandal. “I could look away, but if I did that I would become part of it. Once you’ve crossed that bridge, there’s no going back.”However, the meeting Woodford called to address the claims quickly backfired. The board turned on him and he was fired. But when the fraud was linked to the Japanese mafia, Woodford realised his problems were only just beginning.“I thought I was going to be assassinated,” recalls Woodford, who was forced by the company to give up his apartment and return to the UK. “At times I felt I was in Alice in Wonderland and I questioned my sanity. I was completely isolated.”Fearing for the lives of both himself and his family, Woodford decided to seek safety through publicity. His actions led to two senior Olympus board members being sentenced to three years in prison. In 2012, Woodford won a £10m out-of-court settlement after suing Olympus.Now a patron of the whistleblowing charity Protect, Woodford recommends that whistleblowers act with caution. “If you are going to take on a large company, make sure you seek advice, talk to people you trust and seek legal advice,” he says. He admits that whistleblowing isn’t easy, but is adamant he would be prepared to do it again.Maggie Oliver remembers her experience as a whistleblower as one defined by stress, sleepless nights and fear. “They were the worst two years of my life,” says the former detective constable. “I truly believed I may be prosecuted for simply telling the truth and trying to expose the neglect of the authorities.”While working with Greater Manchester police (GMP), Oliver had been central to uncovering a Rochdale paedophile ring. By interacting with the group’s victims nearly every day for six months, Oliver gradually gained the trust of the vulnerable girls. The girls eventually agreed to come forward, which led to nine members of the gang being sentenced in 2012.For Oliver, though, the actions of the police were not sufficient to safeguard the victims. One of the girls, who had been abused since the age of 14, was named in court as someone who had helped the groomers. Disgusted, Oliver took her complaints to various departments of GMP, and even the Home Office, before resigning in 2012.“I have no regrets about the action I took,” she claims. “I feel proud to know I was strong enough to stand up for what I believed in, and fight to give these kids a voice.”Louise O’Neill at Protect helped secure these interviews.Produced by Joanna Ruck and Matt Fidler"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d90ab85ab649ed97dc0f79deda418a68245b9c79/214_0_3270_1963/master/3270.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5569589f0cd5b19af27d4e810b4c17fb","title":"khashoggi case cctv disappears from saudi consulate in turkey","story":"Security footage removed and Turkish staff told to go home on day missing journalist visitsSecurity camera footage was removed from the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and Turkish staff were abruptly told to take a holiday on the day the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi disappeared while inside the building, Turkish authorities have claimed.A week after Khashoggi vanished in the heart of Turkey’s biggest city, details of the investigation into his disappearance continued to point towards Riyadh having ordered Khashoggi’s seizure.Jamal Khashoggi is one of the Arab world’s most prominent journalists and commentators. He is an outspoken critic of\u0026nbspSaudi Arabia\u0026nbspwho has dared to defy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler.While living in Saudi Arabia, Khashoggi was told to stop writing or posting on Twitter, where he has more than 1.6 million followers. He moved to the US more than a year ago, where he continued to comment on his country both in print and on television. He wrote columns for the Washington Post and\u0026nbspthe .His message struck a nuanced tone in the US, where he tried to acknowledge the reforms undertaken by Bin Salman while also highlighting the flaws.Khashoggi previously had close links with the Saudi royal family, including having served as a media aide to Prince Turki al-Faisal, when the latter was director general of the Saudi intelligence agency.He is also a former editor of the Saudi newspaper al-Watan and had worked with Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a grandson of the first Saudi king who was detained last year as part of what the authorities said was an anti-corruption campaign.Investigators believe the squad responsible for his disappearance from the Saudi consulate spent several hours at the nearby consul general’s house before leaving for the airport in a convoy of six cars, one of which is thought to have carried the missing dissident or his body.A still-frame image emerged on Tuesday of Khashoggi striding towards the diplomatic mission before he disappeared. The black van that was allegedly used later to smuggle him away was parked next to the front door.Details of the planes used to fly 15 Saudi officials from Riyadh to Istanbul have also been confirmed. Two corporate jets rented from a company frequently used by the Saudi government arrived in Istanbul on 2 October and left separately the same evening. One jet, with the tail registration HZ-SK1, left for Cairo, and the second, HZ-SK2, flew to Dubai. Flight tracking records show they both later continued to Riyadh. Turkish investigators believe the CCTV footage from inside the consulate was onboard.A Turkish police team entered the consulate building on Tuesday after being given access by Saudi officials. Journalists had been allowed into the building on Saturday.However, despite a circumstantial case being established that blames Saudi Arabia for Khashoggi’s abduction, there were signs that Turkish officials were unwilling to further incriminate the kingdom, with which Turkey has lucrative trade ties and attempts to maintain a delicate regional relationship.Political leaders have not delivered on pledges to supply video footage that purports to show heavy bags being carried from the consul gate to the waiting cars. Officials who had offered glimpses into the investigation for the past week were no longer prepared to talk.Yasin Aktay, an adviser to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, claimed “the Saudi state is not blamed here”, a marked shift in rhetoric that had earlier called for the kingdom to explain what had happened.“We have our own problems with a deep state,” he told al-Araby in an interview. Earlier, Aktay had pointedly claimed that Khashoggi had been murdered by people sent from Riyadh.In a further sign of an apparent climbdown, the pro-government newspaper Daily Sabah suggested that the focus of the investigation had moved towards the possibility that Khashoggi was smuggled alive on to one of the planes. Turkish officials had been adamant that the journalist was killed inside the consulate a claim they repeated to US authorities who began asking questions about Khashoggi’s disappearance at the weekend.Privately, senior officials have told counterparts in the US and Europe that they still believe Khashoggi was killed, but that political leaders are willing to make a climbdown for Riyadh in return for concessions.The spectre of a political dimension to the investigation has raised the prospect that evidence that could establish Khashoggi’s fate may never be disclosed.The disappearance of the acclaimed columnist and senior adviser to previous Saudi regimes has rocked Washington, where he had been based for the past year as a columnist for the Washington Post, and struck fear through establishment circles in Riyadh, where the 59-year-old had been a popular figure. He was one of the few public intellectuals to openly critique the new administration of the crown prince, and heir to the throne, Mohammed bin Salman.Erdoğan, who is returning from a visit to Budapest, has insisted he is personally interested in the case and has demanded a transparent inquiry. US officials told the  that Turkey had earlier put the evidence it had gathered directly to Saudi officials and had authorised a series of state-sanctioned leaks intended to pressure Riyadh when those officials had refused to respond.The change in tone from Ankara would suggest that attitudes had also shifted in Riyadh, which has strenuously denied any role in Khashoggi’s disappearance and insisted he walked freely from the consulate, which he had attended to sign orce papers to allow him to marry his Turkish fiancée.“The Turks need to continue to be transparent about this,” a senior US official told the . “They have the Saudis in a delicate position here and know more than they’re letting on. This matters to the current administration. This guy can’t be allowed to vanish.”Britain, France and the EU have also called for an urgent, credible investigation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c0f882fa9b692f56dfb885601203d54916e3315/0_111_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b998304796192f60a5733d8f92412ac2","title":"the horror we live in journalist viktoria marinova shocks bulgaria","story":"Killing reopens debate over journalist safety, though it is not clear whether victim was targeted for her workDevotion, glow, faith and kindness. These were among the English words that Viktoria Marinova had jotted down on notepaper that lay untouched on her desk at the TVN studios in Ruse three days after her body was found in parkland beside the Danube.The words seemed appropriate, given that all those who knew Marinova spoke of her warmth, determination and devotion to social justice. The 30-year-old journalist disappeared after going for a run by the river on Saturday, and her body was found later that day. Bulgarian police confirmed she had been raped before she was killed.It was the third murder of a journalist in an EU country within the space of a year, reopening debates about the dangers of reporting, as well as the particular perils faced by female journalists. Last October Daphne Caruana Galizia, a Maltese investigative journalist, was killed when a car bomb planted in her car detonated. In February Ján Kuciak, a Slovak journalist, was shot dead along with his girlfriend.Nobody in Ruse, Bulgaria’s fifth largest city, expected that the next killing would be here. The attack has ided Bulgaria’s journalistic community, with some viewing it as a dark omen about press freedom in the country and others saying it was a tragedy but unlikely to have been linked to her journalism.Authorities have said they are investigating all possibilities but say they are cautious about linking the murder to Marinova’s work. As of Tuesday evening police had yet to charge anyone with the murder. Earlier in the day a spokesman announced that a Romanian citizen had been detained, but police later said there was no apparent connection with the case and he would be released. It was not clear whether they had any other leads.Marinova worked for TVN, a small regional channel based in Ruse. Her new show was called Detektor. The first episode, which also turned out to be the last, featured interviews with two investigative journalists working on a corruption investigation into misuse of EU funds, led by the Bulgarian investigative outlet Bivol.During the broadcast, Marinova lamented the state of media freedom in Bulgaria and promised her show would continue to discuss corruption scandals and carry out its own investigations. Transparency International ranked Bulgaria 111th out of 180 countries in its most recent press freedom index, the lowest of any EU country.“Viktoria Marinova was not a professional investigator but she dared to speak about this and give others the possibility to discuss it,” said Atanas Chobanov, of Bivol. He condemned Bulgarian authorities for immediately dismissing the possibility of a contract killing and claimed police had not even studied CCTV footage from around Marinova’s workplace to see whether she was being followed.He said Bivol journalists had received “credible threats” related to their investigation in recent weeks and had passed them on to police.However, some of Marinova’s own colleagues were not convinced the killing was related to her work. Ivan Stefanov, the channel’s chief producer, who worked with Marinova on Detektor, said she was not working directly on any investigative reports. He said she had not reported any threats before the attack, nor had she spoken of noticing anyone following her or of having any personal problems.Among those mourning Marinova were a group of activists attempting to change legislation to improve rights for disabled children and their families. She had devoted much attention to the issue in recent months, both in her reports and through charitable work.“Viktoria gave people a voice. I can say only good things about her. I am grateful to her for her support,” said 44-year-old Nadezhda Dimova. “She inspired me not only as a journalist, but as a human being. People are dying because this legislation has not been changed.”On Tuesday evening more than 100 joggers, some of them carrying flowers, gathered by the Danube in Ruse to run 5km to the spot where Marinova’s body was found. Before the run, its organiser Velizar Tashev read out a list of demands, including for authorities to install CCTV cameras along the embankment and improve police patrols.The killing fits into a pattern of violent attacks on female reporters. Last October a Russian radio journalist, Tatyana Felgenhauer, was stabbed in the neck at her station’s Moscow studio by a 48-year-old male intruder who had monitored her broadcasts and written blogposts about her. Last August the Swedish journalist Kim Wall was sexually assaulted, murdered and dismembered by a Danish inventor, Peter Madsen, while onboard his miniature submarine. Madsen was jailed for life for the attack.“The fact that a woman has been killed in such a brutal manner – which is, by the way, happening on a daily basis – is what matters,” said Ivan Enchev, an IT specialist who attended a vigil for Marinova in Sofia on Monday evening. “It doesn’t matter whether it was a punitive action for her work or an attack against a woman, there is no positive aspect to this story. I want to express my disgust with the horror we live in.”The sentiment was echoed by Irina Nedeva, a radio journalist and head of the Bulgarian office of the Association of European Journalists. “This is a nightmare for Bulgarian journalists, regardless of whether she was killed because of her last aired show or whether it was about violence against a woman,” she said.Additional reporting by Martin Dimitrov in Sofia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ea5d4f57de3c91093118477935544519ff2976e/0_945_4724_2834/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d27e13ce6ea3175cc5c52518cdbc875","title":"ataturk turkey photography ersoy emin","story":"It’s 75 years since Atatürk died, but he remains the poster boy of modern Turkey.

Photograph: Getty images More than 630 Irish people have been deported from Australia over the last two years according to figures released by the Australian Department of Home Affairs.Overstaying a visa, having a visa cancelled or invalid visas were the most common reasons for their deportation.The Irish Australian Support Association in Queensland (IASAQ), a group that helps Irish people in Australia, said changes to visas had left people in “a grey area” and they were not surprised by the figures.A spokesperson for IASAQ, Paddy Farrelly told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland the changes came as a “shock” and some Irish people in Australia have “fallen between stools”.Earlier this year, Australia scrapped its skilled 457 visa programme, which had allowed tens of thousands of Irish workers to enter the country legally. The visa changes were announced in 2017 by then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull who said he wanted “to put Australians first.”There were allegations that the 457 visa was being misused by employers to import workers “on the cheap” and not to fill genuine skill shortages.The 457 visa was replaced with the Temporary Skill Shortage Visa (TSS), however, the list of occupations that qualify for TSS, was significantly reduced.Mr Farrelly said the transition from the 457 to TSS can be difficult as the new visas are limited, expensive and have an intimidating amount of paper work.He said dozens of people are turning to the Irish Australian Support Group looking for help with visa issues.Melbourne-based Immigration law expert Rick Gunn also told Morning Ireland many people are taking a risk and living undocumented. He said the Australian government was deporting immigrants if they believe they do not have “good character”.Mr Gunn said he recently represented an Irish man held in immigration detention for two months after authorities discovered he did not disclose a minor conviction in Ireland.“The incident was very upsetting for the man and his family.”He urged people to be “upfront and honest” about prior convictions, no matter how minor, when entering Australia.The Irish Australian Support Group urged anyone experiencing visa problems to contact them."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3657767.1539112008!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"defence forces to get extra money for purchases of new equipment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish Army Mowag personnel carriers loading  onto a ship in Dublin  on their way to Chad for a UN mission The Defence Forces has received significant extra money for purchases of new equipment next year across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.Morale in the Defence Forces has been hit in recent times because of complaints about wages, shortages of key staff across the forces and the effects of resignations and retirements.Defence spending next year will increase by €47.5 million to almost €1 billion, though most of the €994 million is absorbed by the pay bill, which will rise €18.5 million. Capital spending will jump €29 million to €106 million.Minister of State for Defence Paul Kehoe said the upgrading and replacement of equipment would help ensure the Defence Forces could meet its peace keeping obligations on United Nations missions.“This allocation of almost €1 billion emphasises the importance attached by the Government to ensuring that the Defence Forces have the resources necessary to deliver on all roles assigned by Government, both at home and overseas.” .Irish troops served with distinction overseas, and Mr Kehoe said the country was proud of them. “The Government remains committed to returning to and maintaining the agreed strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500, and I have ensured that the Defence vote is fully funded to meet the costs for the full establishment figure of 9,500”. Mr Kehoe added that the additional monies for capital expenditure in 2019 would allow for the upgrade of Mowag armoured personnel carriers vehicles that allow Irish troops move around in conflict zones.Light tactical armoured vehicles would also be purchased, and the Air Corps Cessna aircraft would be replaced.He added that the Naval Service’s LÉ Róisín and LÉ Niamh would undergo a mid-life refit. Defence Forces buildings would also be improved. These included including accommodation, catering, workshops, secure storage and training facilities.Projects to upgrade these facilities across the Defence Forces would commence next year, including at the Curragh Camp in Co Kildare and Casement Aerodrome in Baldonnel, Co Kildare.An upgrade of the fuel storage safety system in the Naval Base, Haulbowline, Co Cork, would also commence in 2019.The pensions provision will be increased next year by €10 million to be the projected demand during the year of €249 million.How will it effect you and your finances?

However, he would prefer to be earning the same as his colleagues.Employed after 2011, he is on a lower pay scale than colleagues recruited earlier, which creates “laughable” outcomes on days when when, as sometimes happens, pupils have more than one teacher in the room.“I don’t expect to get back the tens of thousands of euro I have lost in the intervening years, but I would like to be paid the same as my colleagues for doing the same job.“If I am in the room with another teacher in a team, I could be earning €5,000-€6,000 less than my colleague” he said, though he knew that pay was not going to be addressed in the budget.The “refusal” of the Government to sanction pay equality was already known, so he was not that interested in Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe’s budget speech. “I looked at the main bits online,” he said.Noting the extra education funding that will see the recruitment of 1,300 extra teachers, Mr Waters said it would merely cover rising student numbers rather than bringing about an increase in spending on each student.Overall, he said the budget had failed to arouse his interest as it was not addressing the pay issue, which he had been working on for years. “I’m sick working on it,” he said.Mr Waters does not smoke, so he is not affected by the 50 cent increase, but he does drive a diesel car. The 1 per cent vehicle registrations tax surcharge imposed on new diesels will delay changing it.The continuation of incentives for electric cars, and new ones for gas-powered vehicles, are not enough to encourage him to change. “It is an expensive thing to change, so I think I’ll probably stay with my diesel,” he said.How will it effect you and your finances?

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsA special EU summit will likely be needed next month to strike a deal to avoid a hard Border and agree a Brexit withdrawal agreement, Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said. Speaking at the launch of a suite of Budget 2019 measures to prepare for Brexit, Mr Coveney, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, said the UK was expected to introduce a text on their proposal for the so-called backstop guarantee to maintain an open Border shortly but that this was unlikely to be published.He said he recognised that businesses were unsure about how to invest to prepare for the fallout from the UK’s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019 and want “a bit more certainty from the negotiations”.“I hope that they will get that over the next six weeks or so,” he said, referring to the EU-UK negotiations this week which he sees continuing until a special Brexit summit in Brussels in mid-November. Against the backdrop of deadlocked Brexit negotiations, the Government announced measures in the budget worth more than €770 million, including loans for business, supports for the Border and customs training, to prepare for Brexit. This is on top of a new €2 billion “rainy day fund” that could be tapped post-Brexit.“I hope that we negotiate a Brexit that doesn’t require us to dip into the rainy day fund at all and I am pretty confident that we can do that,” Mr Coveney told reporters at a post-budget press conference.The Tánaiste detailed the “Brexit-readiness” measures from Budget 2019 alongside Minister for Business Heather Humphreys, Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed and Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee.The measures include a new €300 million “Future Growth” scheme through which businesses can apply for eight- to 10-year loans of up to €3 million, including unsecured loans of up to €500,000, and educational spending of €300 million to train people in areas vulnerable to Brexit. Mr Creed announced a total of €78 million in Brexit-related funding for agriculture, including for beef farmers, horticulture (where the mushroom industry is particularly affected by Brexit) and Bord Bia. There is also €5 million being provided for customs training for local businesses, €13 million for customs and IT staff for Revenue and animal health and agricultural inspectors for post-Brexit Anglo-Irish trade. He described next week as “a big week” in Brexit negotiations and said he hoped enough progress will have been made for the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to recommend a November meeting on the issue at next week’s EU summit. “I suspect November will probably be needed as well as October to get agreement on that,” he said.He said he anticipated that the legal text the UK would introduce on the backstop – the last-resort option to avoid a hard Border should a future EU-UK trade deal not produce a better solution – would be kept private amongst EU-UK negotiators.“It is unlikely that anyone is going to publish that text. I think when text gets introduced, it will be introduced in the negotiating rooms of Brussels, where both teams will want to try negotiate a position that can be supported by both sides,” he said. Mr Coveney said there would be “carnage”, particularly for Britain, if the UK crashed out of the EU without a deal, but he added that this scenario was “very unlikely” because there was no majority for it in Westminster.The Tánaiste said that the negotiations were at “a very crucial point” and described the intensification in talks this week as “a good thing”, but added that they were “far from complete”.This was why the Government was announcing preparations for Brexit and spending hundreds of millions of euro on the issue in next year’s budget as the negotiations continued.“There is an expectation that the UK side will introduce some legal text which I hope can be helpful in moving this process forward,” he said.How will it effect you and your finances?

Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand via APDUP leader Arlene Foster has reiterated to EU Brexit negotiators that her party rejects any form of barrier to trade between Northern Ireland and Britain. These barriers, she said, include both regulatory or customs, and any potential measures on the Irish Sea or in the market place.Speaking at a meeting in Brussels, Ms Foster said these were her party’s only “red lines”, clarifying that her recent reference to “blood red lines” meant that they “mattered very greatly” and were “deep red” as opposed to “pink” lines. She said she was firmly opposed to any separate EU customs deal for the North because that would prevent the region from participating or benefiting from any future trade deals negotiated by the UK. “We could not support any arrangement that would either give rise to customs or regulatory barriers .”The party’s unbending line was a firm warning that it cannot support moves believed to be under way by the British government to reach a compromise on the Northern Ireland backstop that would involve some regulatory checks on the Irish Sea and others in the market place. Ms Foster, on whose party’s votes the Conservatives depend for their majority, would not be drawn, however, on whether she is prepared to vote down any such package in the House of Commons.Ms Foster and DUP MEP Diane Dodds met the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his deputy Sabine Weyand on Tuesday morning. Ms Weyand also had a separate meeting with Ulster Unionist MEP Jim Nicholson. The DUP delegation was also meeting members of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group group for a working dinner on Tuesday, and will hold talks with the Irish Ambassador Declan Kelleher on Wednesday. Responding to questions about existing animal checks on the Irish Sea, Ms Dodds insisted this was a “misconception” of what was checked. “Live animals have to have veterinary certificates, and they have to be judged suitable and healthy and fit to travel,” she said. “Currently all that happens is that those veterinary certificates are checked and perhaps only 10 per cent of those checks are actual physical inspections.”Under EU proposals, she said “those checks would become 100 per cent, although with a veterinary agreement in a future trade agreement that might be reduced somewhat”. “We are not saying that the checks on live animals should be discontinued. But you could be in the rather ridiculous position where milk produced in Northern Ireland by NI farmers is processed in England but has to be checked as it comes back as yoghurts or protein drinks. That’s the disruption that that would mean within the UK’s internal market.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Nick BradshawOverseas aid is set to increase by almost €110million, bringing the State’s overseas development assistance to its highest level in 10 years. Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said the allocation is a “credible step” towards meeting the Government’s commitment to dedicate 0.7 per cent of gross national income to Official Development Assistance (ODA) by 2030. Mr Coveney said about €45 million of the €110 million of new money will go towards Irish Aid, the bilateral aid programme managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. “Our investment in international development and in the collective response to humanitarian disasters is an important statement of who we are as a people,” Mr Coveney said. “It is also clearly in our interest to contribute to global solutions for global problems. As a small state, as an island and as an open economy, we are better off when countries work together.” Concern said the announcement is to be commended for being the Government’s biggest year-on-year increase in spending on ODA since 2006. “Ireland has a long-standing reputation globally as a leader in international development and Concern looks forward to working with the Government as we help those most in need,” said chief executive, Dominic MacSorley. Dóchas, the Irish Association of Non-Governmental Development Organisations, said the Government’s continued commitment to overseas aid was vital. “We are extremely pleased to see this increase in the overseas budget for 2019 - the most significant budget increase for ODA in over a decade,” said Suzanne Keating, chief executive of Dóchas. “This is the credibility injection that we have been seeking and demonstrates the Government’s continued commitment to overseas aid is vital.”Oxfam Ireland also welcomed the announcement and said the increase in the aid budget shows “strong commitment” to delivering its ODA target. Fianna Fáil’s spokesperson for foreign affairs and trade Niall Collins TD said the Government must set out a “roadmap” if Ireland is to deliver on its commitment to reach the 0.7 per cent ODA target.

Photograph: Eduardo MunozReutersThe United States’ ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has resigned. Speaking in the Oval Office beside Ms Haley, US president Donald Trump said Ms Haley had told him six months ago that she may consider leaving the post. She would be leaving the position at the end of the year, Mr Trump said. The hastily-convened meeting was announced shortly after 10am (3pm Irish time) by the White House. Mr Trump said he will appoint Ms Haley’s successor “in the next two or three weeks – maybe sooner”.Speaking alongside the president, Ms Haley said she wanted to thank him for the opportunity to serve at the United Nations. “It has been an honour of a lifetime. I am such a lucky girl to leave the state that raised me and serve a country I love so very much.”She said that under the Trump administration, the United States was now respected again. Other countries now knew that “if we are going to do something we will follow it through”.In particular, she highlighted the fact that the US had tackled the “anti-Israel bias” at the United Nations, praising the “strength and courage” of Mr Trump for moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. “We will put our embassy where we want to put our embassy,” she said. She also praised Mr Trump’s daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, who both work for the president, describing Mr Kushner as a “hidden genius”. She said she would be campaigning for Mr Trump ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Ms Haley is the latest senior figure to depart the Trump administration. She was one of the few women to hold a senior position within it. Ms Haley was seen as a rising star within Republican politics. Just two weeks ago she attended the annual meeting of the UN Security Council alongside Mr Trump and senior members of the administration. While she has consistently said that she enjoys a strong working relationship with the president, she has also placed herself at odds with him. In December last year she said that women who had accused Mr Trump of sexual misconduct “should be heard”.“They should be heard, and they should be dealt with,” Ms Haley told CBS. “And I think we heard from them prior to the election. And I think any woman who has felt violated or felt mistreated in any way, they have every right to speak up.”A newcomer to foreign policy when she was appointed by Mr Trump as UN ambassador last year, Ms Haley entered the House of Representatives as a member of Congress for South Carolina in 2004. She then became governor of the state in 2010. She rose to national prominence in 2016 after she ordered the confederate flag – a controversial symbol with strong links to slavery – to be removed from the state capitol following the shooting dead of nine African-Americans in a church in Charleston.Though regarded as a politician on the right – her affiliation with the Tea Party helped secure her election in 2010 – she is viewed as a more moderate influence in the White House. She initially opposed Mr Trump when he ran for Republican nominee for president, supporting Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. She in particular criticised Mr Trump’s proposal for a Muslim ban during the presidential election campaign. Ms Haley was born in Bamberg, South Carolina in 1972 to Indian-Sikh parents. Her father was a doctor, her mother a teacher-turned-businesswoman.Since assuming the role of UN ambassador, Ms Haley has taken a strong pro-Israeli line. She also advocated a withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement. However, she has also taken a strong line against Russia, calling out Moscow for electoral interference and its role in Syria in support of the Assad regime.

The majority of these are in low-income countries where health care workers have poor access to testing and treatment facilities.The research team has come up with a system which enables doctors or other health workers to detect TB-specific antibodies in a patient’s sputum. The patient produces a sample of sputum - this is put onto a tiny biosensor device which produces a colour, depending on whether it is positive or negative for TB.Via a smartphone\u0027s camera the app then analyses the colour and delivers a diagnosis within seconds.TB incidence is highest in sub-Saharan Africa and South East AsiaAlamgir Hossain, director of the Anglia Ruskin IT Research Institute, said analysis of colour samples using the naked eye alone was notoriously difficult. “By using the phone’s camera to capture the sample, rather than manually using colour charts, it eliminates human error and avoids any subjectivity around interpretation.  It also means that positive and negative samples do not need to be distinguishable to the human eye or depend on perfect colour vision,” said Prof Hossain.“This system wouldn’t be used instead of seeing a physician but would be a first port of call.  If the app detects tuberculosis it would instruct the user to contact a medical professional,” he added.The scientists hope to eventually add in DNA sequencing to enable the diagnosis to be more robust, said Prof Hossain.“If you add in the DNA sequencing on top of the biosensor the overall framework for the diagnosis will be much better and doctors will be able to consider this as a primary diagnosis. Many remote areas have limited testing facilities so if you can develop a mobile system it will really help,” he said.As well as a smartphone the health worker needs to purchase a small biosensor which has been developed by Universiti Putra. No additional hardware is needed and the system works offline so can be used in areas without internet connection.\u0026#039A quintessential disease of poverty\u0026#039 | The push to free Papua New Guinea from TBProf Hossain believes that the final cost for the system - downloading the app and purchasing the biosensor - could be as little as £2 to £3, depending on funding and uptake.The scientists hope that the diagnostic test, developed with a £129,000 grant from the Newton Fund, will be ready to launch in two years.Prof Hossain is currently supervising three PhD students looking at the use of mobile apps to diagnose diseases such as diabetes and coronary heart disease.“Mobile apps are a growing market in the UK and they have a lot of potential for diagnosing disease,” he said.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security  District nurses spend more time doing computer admin tasks than looking after patients, NHS chief saysFlorida braced for \u0026#39monstrous\u0026#39 Hurricane Michael heading towards coastComment: We used to have no plan for Brexit.

I don\u0027t believe that in a modern play you could write that now. And there\u0027s something so visceral in the way Shakespeare has Lear saying it, that I began to wonder if there was some autobiographic stuff there - whether he had some problem with women, he said.Ian McKellen as King Lear Prof Bate said: I have to be very wary about speculating and projecting Shakespeare\u0027s autobiography on his plays but I do think you\u0027re on to something around that.There are just little bits of circumstantial evidence: a couple of the late sonnets have reference to the mercury baths which is where you went when you caught syphilis. There\u0027s a whiff of scandal around Shakespeare in the end of King James\u0027s reign. His hair falls out it\u0027s also the case it seems that he wasn\u0027t at court much with the actors and there was a law that if someone was suspected of being infected with syphilis, which was endemic at the time, they weren\u0027t allowed within 400 yards of the monarch.So it is just possible that he got up to no good somewhere in the East End of London and caught that.The key misogynistic lines in King LearProf Bate said it could explain the outbursts of anger and also outbursts of sexual disgust in the play. It\u0027s painful to read, especially so nowadays where we\u0027re so attuned to misogyny.Syphilis arrived in England at the end of the 15th century and was known as the pox or the French disease. By 1548 around a quarter of patients treated at St Bart\u0027s were reported to be syphilitic.Please review our commenting policyDistrict nurses spend more time doing computer admin tasks than looking after patients, NHS chief saysFlorida braced for \u0026#39monstrous\u0026#39 Hurricane Michael heading towards coastComment: We used to have no plan for Brexit.

The regulator will also examine\u0026nbspthe risk that each of the Big Four is “too big to fail”, potentially threatening long-term competition.Another question the CMA\u0026nbspwill seek to answer is whether the fact that companies pick their own auditor results in a lack of incentive to produce challenging performance reviews.Some critics have suggested that shareholders - as the outsiders who rely on an audit to assess the health of a company - should have a role in choosing the auditor.CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said: “High-quality audit work underpins a successful economy and benefits us all.

The relationship between the UK and the Netherlands has traditionally been close, and will remain so in the future, but the Dutch view Brexit as a ‘lose-lose’ operation, Mr Blok told reporters at a briefing in the Hague. However, he added: “There’s a famous saying by Johann Cruyff - ‘Every disadvantage has its advantage’. In the case of Brexit this means a number of companies are considering or have already decided to leave the UK, and of course we are in the race to welcome them.“The Dutch population is English speaking, open-minded, we have deep harbours, wide highways, and a very good airport at Schiphol. We are a very attractive location, and we are not shy to promote it.”Davis says Tories will lose election unless Brexit plan scrappedFears rat hair and maggots may appear in UK food after BrexitBoE warns of \u0027pressing\u0027 need to protect financial products from BrexitThis is how Europe\u0027s national borders could be redrawn after Brexit He noted that many financial firms have already made the decision to move “at least part of their operations” out of the UK to mainland Europe, because “they are insecure about the effects of Brexit”.“As long as there is not a Brexit agreement there can be nothing but insecurity and they are spreading the risks,” he said. “I understand Amsterdam will host quite a number of specialised training companies. Of course we welcome these companies but we would rather there was no Brexit - but it’s too late for that.”Mr Blok said he was more hopeful that an agreement could be reached following Theresa May’s speech at the recent Tory conference, but added: “A hard Brexit is still possible, the Netherlands is also preparing for a hard Brexit. Not because we hope for it but because we are not sure it won’t happen.“We are an extremely important trading partner (for the UK), with Rotterdam Harbour, the largest European harbour, facing the UK. There is very intensive trade, so we are preparing in a very practical way, engaging customs officers, engaging phyto-sanitary personnel, but also thinking about parking space at the ferry terminals in the Hook of Holland - because we have to.”In terms of the Netherlands’ approach to the Brexit negotiations, Mr Blok said: “We have no negative intentions whatsoever towards the British.”While ‘it was a UK decision to start the Brexit procedure’, the Dutch regret that decision but respect the referendum result. However, he said: “During negotiations we will act within one unified European combination, and that’s not because we want to ‘gang up’ on the UK, but because we are one trading bloc negotiating with a new trading bloc in the making, and trade negotiations within the EU are always done on behalf of the whole union.”Mr Blok’s comments come after King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands said he still regrets the UK’s vote for Brexit.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The regulator will also examine\u0026nbspthe risk that each of the Big Four is “too big to fail”, potentially threatening long-term competition.Another question the CMA\u0026nbspwill seek to answer is whether the fact that companies pick their own auditor results in a lack of incentive to produce challenging performance reviews.Some critics have suggested that shareholders - as the outsiders who rely on an audit to assess the health of a company - should have a role in choosing the auditor.CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said: “High-quality audit work underpins a successful economy and benefits us all. Given the in-depth thinking already done by the CMA and the Competition Commission before it, we plan to move swiftly and to issue our provisional findings before Christmas.”The Financial Reporting Council, the accountancy watchdog, which has been calling for an inquiry, welcomed the CMA\u0027s announcement.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The relationship between the UK and the Netherlands has traditionally been close, and will remain so in the future, but the Dutch view Brexit as a ‘lose-lose’ operation, Mr Blok told reporters at a briefing in the Hague. However, he added: “There’s a famous saying by Johann Cruyff - ‘Every disadvantage has its advantage’. In the case of Brexit this means a number of companies are considering or have already decided to leave the UK, and of course we are in the race to welcome them.“The Dutch population is English speaking, open-minded, we have deep harbours, wide highways, and a very good airport at Schiphol. We are a very attractive location, and we are not shy to promote it.”Davis says Tories will lose election unless Brexit plan scrappedFears rat hair and maggots may appear in UK food after BrexitBoE warns of \u0027pressing\u0027 need to protect financial products from BrexitThis is how Europe\u0027s national borders could be redrawn after Brexit He noted that many financial firms have already made the decision to move “at least part of their operations” out of the UK to mainland Europe, because “they are insecure about the effects of Brexit”.“As long as there is not a Brexit agreement there can be nothing but insecurity and they are spreading the risks,” he said. “I understand Amsterdam will host quite a number of specialised training companies. Of course we welcome these companies but we would rather there was no Brexit - but it’s too late for that.”Mr Blok said he was more hopeful that an agreement could be reached following Theresa May’s speech at the recent Tory conference, but added: “A hard Brexit is still possible, the Netherlands is also preparing for a hard Brexit. Not because we hope for it but because we are not sure it won’t happen.“We are an extremely important trading partner (for the UK), with Rotterdam Harbour, the largest European harbour, facing the UK. There is very intensive trade, so we are preparing in a very practical way, engaging customs officers, engaging phyto-sanitary personnel, but also thinking about parking space at the ferry terminals in the Hook of Holland - because we have to.”In terms of the Netherlands’ approach to the Brexit negotiations, Mr Blok said: “We have no negative intentions whatsoever towards the British.”While ‘it was a UK decision to start the Brexit procedure’, the Dutch regret that decision but respect the referendum result. However, he said: “During negotiations we will act within one unified European combination, and that’s not because we want to ‘gang up’ on the UK, but because we are one trading bloc negotiating with a new trading bloc in the making, and trade negotiations within the EU are always done on behalf of the whole union.”Mr Blok’s comments come after King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands said he still regrets the UK’s vote for Brexit.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As well as the two phones – the smaller and bigger version – there was\u0026nbspa new version of the Google Home voice assistant that has a screen, as well as a\u0026nbspnew tablet.Most of the new devices had already been leaked ahead of the official unveiling, but Google still managed a few surprises, especially with its exceptional camera.A full round-up of the event can be found below.As we wait for everything to get started, perhaps it\u0027s worth taking a trip down memory lane to where it all began: the original Pixel. I reviewed it in glowing terms all the way back in 2016, and I think the phone has kept up the promises it showed at that time.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s that original review.With the launch of Indy Minds, we\u0027re offering editors\u0027 letters, which offer a little peek behind the scenes here. And I\u0027ve written today\u0027s, which covers the Google launch as well as our preparations and thoughts. You can take a look at here if you like.Google has lots going on today, not all of it quite as fun or as exciting as the Pixel. For instance, it just disclosed there was a major hack of Google+, and that it\u0027s shutting down.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s why that\u0027s important, even if you don\u0027t consider yourself a Google+ user (which, well, who among us does).We\u0027re starting off with a bit of an unusual video about all of the leaks there have been relating to the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. And there have been a lot.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe soundtrack\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsp\u0027Help\u0027 by The Beatles – a hint for things to come perhaps? Google Assistant anyone?Rick Osterloh comes on stage to tell us that 2018 marks the 20th anniversary of Google. It\u0027s fair to say the company has achieved a lot in that time, but Osterloh doesn\u0027t have time to tell us about all of that. He\u0027s here to talk about the Pixel.\u0026nbspMany of you in this room say last year\u0027s Pixel 2 still takes the best photos even after a year with so many amazing phones, he says, before moving on to the AI technology that makes this possible.From out of a pedestal in the middle of the room, appear three devices: The Pixel 3, Pixel Slate and Google Home Hub.\u0026nbspEager reporters are crowding around to get a picture, as Osterloh races through the announcements.\u0026nbspThe Pixel Slate apparently brings the power and productivity of a desktop to a tablet, according to Osterloh. Google definitely isn\u0027t the first to make that claim.\u0026nbspThe Google Home Hub, as you might imagine, is for the home. The smart home in 2018 is too complex, he says. I dunno if a brand new device is the way to make things any clearer.Diya Jolly, Google\u0027s vice president of product management, comes on stage to talk about the smart home, revealing that queries to Google Home has gone up 400 per cent in the past year.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNow imagine not just hearing\u0026nbspa response, but being able to\u0026nbspsee\u0026nbspa response. That is the power of Google Home Hub, she says, referencing the screen that accompanies the hub, as she refers to it.It\u0027s a bit like the Portal device that Facebook unveiled this week, however there is one key difference.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWe\u0026nbspconsciously did not put a camera on the Hub so that is comfortable to use in private spaces like the bedroom, she says.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s\u0026nbsplots\u0026nbspof digital wellbeing here. It\u0027s been a major part of every announcement. The Hub, for instance, can be put into a special downtime mode so that it won\u0027t bother you the Slate will start to go to sleep at night time. Like Anthony said about the Hub\u0027s lack of cameras, it\u0027s hard to read Google and Apple\u0027s focus on this stuff as anything but a shot at people like Facebook, even if they aren\u0027t doing it consciously.Please allow a moment for the live blog to loadShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Last month, a driver of the Lyft\u0026nbspride-hailing service discovered a high-end Android device that had all the hallmarks of being the next flagship Google Pixel.The leaked images shared by the Lyft driver revealed that Google is planning\u0026nbspa dual-lens camera at\u0026nbspthe front of the device – presumably for improved selfies.The rear camera, however, bucks the trend of other high-end smartphones by sticking with a single-lens setup.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

By Patrick KingsleyClick to followThe IndependentAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, the number of children receiving at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled in the last yearIt’s half past eight, and the school day is just starting at Morecambe Bay Primary, a state-run\u0026nbspschool in northwest England. Siobhan Collingwood, the headteacher, points\u0026nbspto a cheerful boy munching his way through two slices of toast – his first meal of the day.Teachers, she says, sometimes find him sifting through trash cans for discarded fruit. “He’d eat his way through whatever we put in front of him.”Some students trickle\u0026nbspthrough without stopping they’ve\u0026nbspalready eaten. But a few dozen head\u0026nbspstraight to the food counter. Of 350 students, roughly one in three would not have breakfast unless the school provided it, Collingwood reckons.Brexit wasn’t caused by austerity, and here’s the proofDuring Collingwood’s 13 years as headteacher at Morecambe Bay Primary, there have\u0026nbspalways been a few hungry children. But two years ago, the staff noticed an increasing number of youngsters returning undernourished after spending school breaks at home.Initially, Collingwood and her staff were puzzled.\u0026nbspMany parents held jobs, even if they struggled to cover the bills. Then it dawned on them that the rising number of hungry children at Morecambe Bay coincided with sharp reductions in welfare benefits associated with the clumsy introduction of a new welfare programme.“As we spoke to parents,” Collingwood says, “it became clear that for many of them, it was caused by changes to the benefit system rolled out in recent years, which were forcing families into crisis.”Across Britain, the number of children living in poverty has jumped sharply in the past six years, a trend that critics blame in part on the\u0026nbspgovernment’s policy of austerity, the budget-slashing response to the 2008 financial crisis\u0026nbspsteadily reshaping British life.And there is no immediate relief on the horizon. The County Councils Network, a group of local governing bodies, warned recently of £1bn\u0026nbspin budget cuts nationwide next year, draining more money from social services, including some for children.To be clear, Britain is not Venezuela. Reports of hungry children showing up in Morecambe doctors’ offices with rickets have proved false. But that is cold comfort in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one that over the years has made a strong commitment to child welfare.While hunger is not the only social pathology associated with childhood poverty, it is perhaps the hardest to conceal. In that respect, it is a flashing signal of a deepening problem.For children, the consequences of poverty can be severe. In the short term, poverty elevates the risk of illness, hunger and social stigma. In the long term, it can create a vicious cycle from which a child struggles to escape, especially in class-conscious Britain.British teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are roughly a third as likely to achieve good GCSE\u0026nbspgrades, according to government statistics.They are then roughly half as likely to go to university, according to a separate set of government data. Those who do make it are less likely to get a better paid job within six months of graduation than those from more privileged backgrounds. And they are less likely to make it into high status professions, such as finance, law or medicine.Even those who do crack the “class ceiling” earn an average of 16 per cent less than more privileged peers, researchers at the London School of Economics found.The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the pastAnd those from poorer backgrounds are likely to die around five years earlier than those who are not, government data suggests.Before the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent budget squeeze, successive British governments, both Conservative and Labour, achieved progress on childhood poverty. The number of minors living in “relative poverty” – families with an annual household income less than 60 per cent of the national median, after housing costs – fell by roughly 800,000\u0026nbspto 3.5 million\u0026nbspbetween 1998 and 2012, or 27 per cent of all Britons aged 16 or younger.But the same year that parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act, a central plank of the austerity programme, the trend began to reverse.\u0026nbspSince 2012, about 600,000 children have fallen back into “relative poverty”. During the same period, the number of children requiring food handouts from the Trussell Trust, the country’s largest network of food banks, more than tripled, to over 484,000 from nearly 127,000.Overall, since returning to power in 2010, the Conservatives have announced more than £30bn\u0026nbspin benefit cuts and abandoned prior targets to substantially reduce child poverty by 2020.By 2021, roughly 35 per cent of all minors in Britain are predicted to be poor, according to forecasts by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And the country’s pending departure from the European Union may deepen the problem, because of rising living costs and the sudden loss of funding from Brussels for young people, according to a joint assessment by seven leading children’s charities.In November, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty\u0026nbspPhilip Alston will make an official visit to Britain to research the connection between the austerity programme and the rise in poverty – the first such visit to Britain by a United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty.“It’s increasingly evident, particularly to people working with children, that we’re in a child poverty crisis,” says Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, a British charity. “And it is primarily to do with the massive cuts to benefits.”The Conservative Party leaders who pushed through the austerity programme\u0026nbspdispute that it is the cause of rising child poverty, or that child poverty is increasing. They argue that universal credit – the\u0026nbspnew system that bundles most payments into one –\u0026nbspis an improvement.The new system is “infinitely better than what it replaced”, says Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister who oversaw the changes. “The process of stepping into work is easier.”That rationale is being questioned. Though unemployment has been more than halved under the Conservatives, the overall child poverty rate has risen. And roughly two-thirds of poor children have at least one parent who works, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.“We tell ourselves completely the wrong story about poverty in the UK,” Garnham says. “The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the past.”Created with Sketch.Greeks slide deeper into poverty Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Working, but poorJust outside Morecambe, a tourist town that no longer draws so many tourists, George McCullough, a single parent to a six-year-old son, is\u0026nbspin financial meltdown. His rent has\u0026nbspfallen into arrears, and he can\u0026nbspno longer pay the family’s utility bills. He’s started\u0026nbspto dip into his overdraft, incurring further bank charges.He’s\u0026nbspstopped socialising and sometimes skips\u0026nbspmeals to ensure that his son eats\u0026nbspthree times a day. But he can\u0026nbspno longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.“He basically can’t go to any of his mates’ parties or houses,” McCullough says. “I literally can’t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.”What\u0026nbspthrew\u0026nbsphis affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, McCullough received around £685\u0026nbspevery month to supplement the roughly £500\u0026nbspa month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.It’s\u0026nbspnot just that he now receives\u0026nbsproughly £40\u0026nbspless a month, though for a family that was already struggling to stay above the poverty line, the cut – the cost of a week’s groceries – was painful. (Others have experienced worse: the average working family has lost more than £75\u0026nbspa month, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group.)What has really hurt McCullough\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphow that loss is\u0026nbspcompounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment –\u0026nbspa dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In McCullough’s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre“If this is going to be a regular occurrence,” McCullough asked, “where is the incentive to work?”McCullough’s experiences are not unique. The government’s own research into the system found that nearly half of claimants needed help to fill out the application form, while four in 10 were still facing financial difficulties eight months into their time on universal credit.Duncan Smith, who was the secretary of state for work and pensions between 2010 and 2015, acknowledges\u0026nbspproblems with the way the system has been put into effect.\u0026nbspHe even resigned in 2015 because the finance minister at the time, George Osborne, cut an additional £4bn\u0026nbspfrom the welfare budget. “I thought that was too much,” Duncan Smith says.But “the system itself is the right system,” he adds. “Though a large number of working families are still in poverty, they were in deeper poverty when they were out of work. As they move into work, they’re better off.”Back at McCullough’s, the father’s eyes well\u0026nbspup as his phone buzzes\u0026nbspwith debt notices from the local water board, and he describes\u0026nbsphow he struggles\u0026nbspto provide his son with some of the basic things in life – like fresh vegetables, new clothes and haircuts.McCullough voted Conservative in past elections and says he would do so again if an election were held tomorrow. Despite his travails, he supports the party’s cautious approach to state spending, and he thinks there are too many people expecting handouts for nothing.But he no longer believes that restructuring benefits will get more people into work, or more children out of poverty.“Until you walk a mile in someone’s shoes, you can’t know,” McCullough says. “Until you’ve seen how it works, you don’t understand.”In Morecambe, the area’s Conservative MP\u0026nbspDavid Morris\u0026nbspsays in an email that child poverty had fallen in his constituency, and blames\u0026nbsp“left-wing political activists” for any suggestion to the contrary. In previous interviews, he has accused headteacher Collingwood of having political motivations for speaking out.But the demand for free breakfasts at Morecambe Bay Primary is not the only warning sign.The relative child poverty rate in Morris’s constituency rose to 25.9 per cent from 2013 to 2017, up from 24.2 per cent, according to research by the Centre\u0026nbspfor Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. That may not sound like much, but the rise has produced marked changes on the ground.How social supermarkets are filling a gap in austerity BritainAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, for instance, the number of children who received at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled to 1,229 in 2017-18, from 656 in 2013-14. At the local branch of Citizens Advice the number of food vouchers distributed to children in the same period increased sixfold, to 1,336 from 222.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre, where social workers would work with children and parents to solve their problems.Since 2010, however, roughly 1,000 of these centres have been closed across Britain after about £990m\u0026nbspin funding cuts. Those that remain – such as those in the Morecambe area – have substantially reduced their capacity.“The caseload is growing, and the system\u0026nbspby which we would have supported them is diminishing,” Collingwood says. “We feel much more like an island.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That is certainly the case where me and Rupert Murdoch are concerned.I was a young, new journalist on The Sunday Times. I’d been charged with “gutting” an official report into a business deal – the buyer was thought to have covered up the source\u0026nbspof his money. It was a big story at the time. I was called to the editor’s office\u0026nbspand told, to my shock, that I was not only going to cover the findings, but I was writing that week’s leader.Just at that point, as the news sank in, the editor suddenly rose. Behind me, a familiar figure had walked, unannounced, into the room. It was Murdoch, the proprietor. He gestured to sit down, and asked what we were discussing.Rupert Murdoch may be revitalised by his exit from SkyThe editor told him, and explained that it was going to be the subject of an editorial\u0026nbspand that I was putting it together. Whereupon Murdoch turned to me, fixed me with a stare, and asked: “Why does it matter?”I stammered some sort of reply about the importance of knowing where people’s funding originated – this was well before money laundering became a hot topic. Murdoch wrinkled his face. I was on shaky ground, clearly he did not think it of any importance at all. Then, another man who was standing in the doorway, who was accompanying him, spoke. He reminded Murdoch that they’d done a deal with the subject of the official inquiry, which had gone sour. Murdoch listened, and nodded. “That’s right, I remember.” He looked at me. “Son, write it as hard as you like.”Down the years, the memory of that short encounter has stuck. Murdoch was not physically large, but he conveyed immense power. His energy was obvious. He was naturally combative, constantly seeking to challenge.Back then, the basement under The Sunday Times building in\u0026nbspWapping was a store room. It was full of satellite dishes. Sky TV was in its infancy, and it relied on the newfangled device of a dish rather than the traditional aerial. If I’m honest, I doubt if many of us gave the fledgling venture much of a chance. Terrestrial broadcasting, led by the BBC, was so entrenched in the UK, that the prospect of it being seriously taken on seemed fanciful. Not only that, Sky would have to rely on a pay-per-view model, while the BBC was funded by the government, and by what was effectively a tax in the form of the annual licence fee.The amount the Murdoch family is said to have made from selling their 39 per cent stake in Sky to ComcastSome 30 years later, Murdoch has sold his remaining 39 per cent stake in Sky to the US company Comcast, in a deal that valued the UK firm at £30bn, and which netted the founder and his family £12bn.The company statement which accompanied the deal showed I was not alone in my scepticism. “When we launched Sky in 1989 it was four channels produced from a prefab structure in an industrial park on the fringes of west London,” it said. “We bet – and almost lost –\u0026nbspthe farm on launching a business that many didn’t think was such a good idea. Today, Sky is Europe’s leading entertainment company and a world-class example of a customer-driven enterprise.”While that hints at the risk Murdoch took –\u0026nbspand gives some indication of his resulting emotional attachment to the company, and pride in his achievement\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspit does not say what Sky also did: transforming English football rivalling the mighty BBC for news coverage with Sky News and taking on broadband providers by offering internet services. And as it says, the company spread across Europe, in Italy and Germany. In the process, Sky also grew to become a central component in the Murdoch global empire.Rupert Murdoch may be revitalised by his exit from SkyComcast beats Rupert Murdoch’s Fox in Sky takeover battleMPs vow to defy ‘threatening’ newspaper headlines on Brexit voteTony Blair: closeness to the Murdoch press was a ‘necessary evil’Now, it’s gone. Not only that, Murdoch has previously sold much of 21st Century Fox’s film and TV production assets to Disney in a $70bn (£54bn) deal, leaving him and his family with the Fox sports and news channels, and the News Corp newspaper and publishing businesses in the UK, US and Australia.That’s still a massive undertaking, and one that would keep most people fully engaged. But Murdoch is not most people. Even at 87 years of age he exhibits the ambition and drive of someone much younger.There have been signs in recent years of Murdoch slowing down. But it would be wrong to suppose these latest developments\u0026nbspwill see him signal the end. When he gave evidence to the House of Commons select committee on phone hacking by his newspapers in 2012\u0026nbspthe slowness of his answers, containing numerous pauses, shocked many.Not those who know Murdoch. He’s always spoken like this, particularly in a situation where he is being confronted and put on the spot. His tactic is to buy time, to speak after a considered silence, to be drawn out, and careful.He is extremely happily ensconced\u0026nbspwith his new wife, Jerry Hall, 25 years his junior. At a recent party, attended by media and arts folk, their arrival drew the usual sarcastic whispers, along the lines of what does the tall, former supermodel see in the much older billionaire. My wife, who was observing, said it was obvious – they were very much in love, you only had to look at their body language, and their attentiveness towards each other, to realise that.She had a point: they did indeed appear infatuated, moving away from the crowd to sit,\u0026nbspchat and laugh together.These days, Murdoch is more likely to be found in suburban Richmond, in southwest London, where Jerry has long maintained a glorious home, than in one of the world’s business centres. Early mornings often find him taking a constitutional walk in nearby Richmond Park. But that does not mean the friendly old cove – several journalists have declared their astonishment at seeing the feared media titan strolling along, smiling and relaxed – is not pondering as he goes.It’s too easy to suppose the phrase “clogs to clogs in three generations” applies to Rupert and his offspring. On the face of it that might appear so – he spends three decades building up Sky, longer where his newspapers are concerned\u0026nbsphis progeny are not up to the task of grabbing the steering wheel and pushing the businesses on to even greater heights.It’s true that they might lack their father’s hunger and clarity of vision. It’s impossible for instance to imagine James, Lachlan or Elisabeth (Prudence, their elder half-sister, is not so business-oriented) having the courage to buy a fading paper like The Sun, and to turn it into the self-styled “People’s Paper”, challenging the orthodoxy every inch of the way. Or being prepared to tilt at BBC News. Or\u0026nbspdisrupting the established order by forcing up the price of live sports rights.Neither, though, are any of the three exactly business schmucks. Each has proved themselves to be successful, capable of guiding and leading. They are however very different characters, with specific interests and qualities. Broadly, James is into distribution and technology, Lachlan loves news, Elisabeth is adept at developing new TV content. Ideally, possibly, Murdoch might have hoped for one of them to emerge as a Rupert Mk2, but that has not materialised.According to Murdoch’s biographer, Michael Wolff, he was desperate for his children to take over –\u0026nbsp“taking pride of place even over profits.”It was not to be.The fact is that with the sales, Murdoch has seen the threat posed by the digital juggernauts, realised he was embedded predominantly in legacy media, as it’s somewhat disparagingly referred to by the onliners, decided it was going to be tough\u0026nbsp(and get even tougher)\u0026nbspto compete – so stayed in the game, but readied to sell up if the price was right.Murdoch’s passion is in power, in the nexus of politics and business – and that is in newsThat moment has been reached, but while it must rankle that his interests have shrunk, he can take satisfaction from the realisation that the price paid is far higher than anyone foresaw. He may be emotionally attached, but price will always win out. Indeed, he can allow himself a wry smile that Comcast may turn out to have overpaid.Meanwhile, the pressure of combatting the tech behemoths is off, and all he has to do is count his winnings. Murdoch’s situation is akin to that of a poker player getting out while on top. Yes, he may have gone on to chalk up yet more brilliant hands, but equally he may not have been dealt any more. Better, surely, to duck out now, and leave the agony of battle, and watch how the cards fall to the other players in future.There were opponents –\u0026nbspJames, in particular, is believed to have been resistant (as he should have been, since it was James’s part of the Murdoch business mass that was being offloaded).In the end, says Wolff:\u0026nbsp“It is Hall who is said to have given voice to the obvious: just sell and be done.”But it’s not as if the Murdochs are quitting completely. Not only do they retain Fox News and their other sports channels and Fox assets\u0026nbsp(now repackaged in New Fox, to be run by Lachlan), but they have some of the world’s leading print titles with their attendant websites, to be going on with. And bags of cash.They’re now able to pick and choose what they want to buy, where they want to go. One assumption is that they will bolster New Fox’s presence in sports by purchasing more live TV rights. Another is that they will seek to get back into content creation by making their own programmes for the Fox TV networks. Already, names like Sony Pictures Entertainment and Lionsgate are being mentioned as possible acquisition targets. Or, New Fox might decide to start from scratch and develop its own version of Netflix.Tony Blair: closeness to the Murdoch press was a ‘necessary evil’Lachlan takes the tiller at New Fox, answerable to his father. James is going off to pursue other interests – he is a director of Tesla, and a close friend of Matthew Vaughn, the film producer and director, and the possibility of James and Matthew hooking up in business together has been rumoured.Of course, it won’t be the same, but consider: New Fox alone should generate more than $2bn a year in cash, and that’s without dipping into the proceeds from the sales of Fox’s entertainment and production arms, and Sky. Murdoch and the younger Murdochs, in short, are not leaving the global media stage. Not yet.It may just be that the sell-offs allow Murdoch to return to his first love: newspapers. He was never that much interested in producing entertainment shows and films. His passion is in power, in the nexus of politics and business – and that is\u0026nbspin news. And that means Fox, but it also means newspapers, where he began, in Australia, all those years ago.In Australia, his newspapers played a pivotal role in the\u0026nbsprecent putsch against the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, criticising his energy policy. In the UK, his company has moved into news and current affairs radio, adding Talk Radio. Meanwhile, his News UK newspapers continue to enjoy prominence and influence, setting the agenda for TV and radio newscasts.Gove and Rupert Murdoch’s relationship should be investigated, says Private Eye editor Ian HislopIn the US, Murdoch finds himself in a curious position. He’s not thought to have much regard for Donald Trump, although he is close to Ivanka, Trump’s daughter, and her husband, Jared Kushner.Trump, though, is a Republican, and a maverick, someone who likes to shake up the established way. In that sense, he is just like the head of the Fox channel –\u0026nbspTrump’s favourite and, in turn, a strident supporter of the president –\u0026nbspand the newspapers, The Wall Street Journal and New York Post.Murdoch may have little time for Trump. For all his directness, and for all the cheekiness of some of his titles, notably The Sun, Murdoch remains a serious man at heart, reserving his favour for conviction politicians. But even if Trump does not qualify for praise\u0026nbspin Murdoch’s eyes,\u0026nbspthe media chief still remains a hugely vital figure, right at the centre of the daily cut and thrust surrounding the president.There is much, then, for Murdoch to relish. A chapter or two has been brought to a close, but the story of Murdoch and the Murdochs is far from over.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns and strategic communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

disarray’\u0026nbspas British project leaders have their positions handed to European partnersClick to followThe IndependentProfessor Peter Coveney is concerned about the fate of medical research in the country following BrexitA top British scientist has called the government “totally chaotic” as he stands to lose\u0026nbsphis leadership of major European projects after Brexit.\u0026nbspProfessor Peter Coveney heads up three EU projects with a total value of around £15m, and he says work like his will be compromised if a deal is not agreed before March.His research, which aims to create a “forecasting system” that predicts disease, involves scientists working across Europe but is led from University College London.A no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK science communityWhile the government said\u0026nbspit will fund British scientists participating in European projects if they lose out on money post-Brexit, it has not promised to support entire projects with UK scientists at the helm.The EU currently hands British project leaders millions of euros to distribute among their partners, but it will not do this if the UK is relegated to a so-called “third country” after Brexit.“The big thing that is unclear is that there is no agreement from the government here to continue to support projects that are led by the UK,” said Professor Coveney.“So leadership of projects – big ones that are influential – is thrown completely into disarray.”Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with

simulate human bodies and plan people’s medical treatments and surgeries in advance.Due to limited British capacity to undertake such projects, he said this kind of research is totally dependent on European collaboration.His criticism comes after Royal Society president Venki Ramakrishnan\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspTV particle physicist Professor Brian Cox voiced their concerns about the impact of Brexit – particularly a no-deal outcome – on British science.Many leading scientists, including two Nobel prize winners, have backed The Independent‘s campaign for a Final Say on the Brexit vote.Leading scientists back call for Brexit deal voteThe UK is currently positioned as a European leader, home to many of the EU’s most prestigious research institutions and receiving 15 per cent of the funding from the flagship European funding programme Horizon 2020.However, this status will be threatened if the nation’s top scientists are forced to hand over the reins of their research to partners.Such an outcome now seems likely, as the government expects the UK to become a third country without a deal, and the prospect of a no-deal Brexit now looks more plausible than ever before.He wants reassurances that his projects and the livelihoods of lab members who are paid with this funding are not jeopardised.Professor Coveney contacted Mr Gyimah to voice his concerns, and received an assurance that the government was “seeking discussion” with the European Commission concerning a no-deal scenario.“This would need to include projects where the UK participant is responsible for coordinating funding,” Mr Gyimah wrote.Scientists fear loss of half a billion pounds of funding after no-dealDismissing this response as “merely regurgitating” information from the government’s official no-deal planning documents “that was unhelpful in the first place”, Professor Coveney said he needs the government to guarantee it will replace any lost funding in its entirety. He has laid out his case in a blog post for the campaign group Scientists for EU.“The picture is as follows: if you were to be a third country following midnight on 29\u0026nbspMarch and you wanted to continue to run these big projects, it would be incumbent on you to fund the entire thing,” he said.This would mean committing to funding not only the British scientist in charge of the project, but also the international team working with them.Despite the expense, he said this was a price worth paying to maintain UK leadership in science and protect the health of its citizens by funding medical research.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Surprising everyone with a measured, thoughtful and carefully worded post on Instagram, the 28-year-old pop star has endorsed not one, but two Democrat candidates for the upcoming mid-term elections – to the horror of Republicans everywhere.Country artists, even ones who are global pop stars, aren’t supposed to be progressive (as the\u0026nbspDixie Chicks found in 2003 when they opposed\u0026nbspthe Iraq War). So much so that when Swift refused to endorse a presidential candidate during the 2016 election, everyone assumed she’d voted for Donald Trump. Critics used “evidence” like her blonde hair to align her with\u0026nbspthe far right, while one publication went so far to run an editorial accusing her of being “an envoy for Trump’s values”, because her songs apparently echoed Trump’s obsession with “petty score-settling” – forgetting it’s a bit different when said score-settler is running the most powerful nation on earth. Anyway, Swift is clearly fed up of everyone’s rubbish guesswork.Events in the past two years have changed her view on voicing political opinions, Swift explained. She didn’t specify, but you can fairly assume those events include winning a sexual assault case against a radio DJ accused of groping her being caught up in a feud with Kanye West and his wife Kim Kardashian and having to watch a misogynist, neo-Nazi apologist become president of the United States.Swift has previously been criticised for her apparent lack of self-awareness over the privileges she enjoys as a wealthy, young white woman – one of the most notable being when she responded to Nicki Minaj’s frustration at not being nominated for video of the year at the VMAs in 2015. Another was when she was accused of playing the victim after being name-dropped in West’s track “Famous”, where he called her a bitch and claimed credit for her fame. Kim Kardashian branded Swift a “snake”,\u0026nbspand Swift was besieged by an army of West and Kardashian fans posting snake emojis on her Instagram.How might Kavanaugh shape abortion, gun control, and impeachment lawTaylor Swift gets political: Reactions to her Democrat endorsementBut over the last two years, Swift appears to have gone to enormous lengths to educate herself about representation and inclusivity. Her Reputation world tour stars\u0026nbspa wealth of dancers and backing musicians from a range of ethnicities, backgrounds and body types, and she used her massive platform to speak clearly and passionately about LGBTQ+ rights. Her friend, the singer, producer, actor and dancer Todrick Hall, praised her for taking the time to “actively listen to me, her queer friend who also happens to be a person of colour”. Meanwhile, Kanye is parading around in a MAGA hat and endorsing Trump in off-script speeches on Saturday Night Live.Kanye West \u0027Being mentally ill is not an excuse to act like a jack*ss\u0027While it’s still not clear how much of an impact Swift will have on the Tennessee mid-term results, Swift has made it clear she will never be pressured into doing or saying something that others want her to. This statement was on her own terms, from her own platform, made when she was ready. And that, in itself, is an inherently political act:\u0026nbspSwift grew up amid the rise of a social media age where your past views often come back to haunt you – where an old tweet can get you fired, or a misjudged remark from a decade before can still ignite a baying mob. It\u0027s no surprise that she was previously reluctant to say anything.\u0026nbspBut by referencing how her views have changed, and also acknowledging how she may not agree with everything her chosen candidates do, she allows room for nuance. Which, in this day and age, is too often absent from political discourse.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

I asked them repeatedly to send help for her. One of them made a phone call about her.”Later that night, Ms Shawo told Ms Dagnachew she had made it out of the tower with her husband and son, Lucas, but she had lost her five-year-old, Isaac, during their desperate escape bid.“She asked me if I knew where Isaac was, I was distraught when she told me that Isaac was missing and I had to pass the phone to someone else, I was in pieces,” she said.Survivor who fled Grenfell recalls realising father was still insideKensington council spends almost £30m on hotels for Grenfell survivorsKensington council spends almost £30m on hotels for Grenfell survivorsEach time I called her, she kept saying, ‘I cannot find him.’ She was totally distraught and was screaming. It was so painful and awful.”The family later learnt the five-year-old had died in the tower’s staircase.From the grass outside the tower, Ms Dagnachew\u0026nbspsaid she saw Behailu Kebede, who lived in the flat where the fire broke out on the fourth floor. She had lived in the tower for around 25 years and had known Mr Kebede since she was a child, she said.“Behailu was in shock. No one was with him ... he was clearly very shaken,” she said. Mr Kebede’s friend Berkti and her son Biruk lived on the 18th floor, she said, and he later learned they died in the fire.Reflecting on the effect of the fire has had on her, Ms Dagnachew said: “I keep seeing those who have died in the faces of people in the street. I still walk in the direction of home to the tower and when I get there I see that it has been boarded up.”She had been plagued by feelings of guilt over not doing more to alert her neighbours, she said.“I was in a state of panic and shock getting out of the tower and I have since had terrible guilt feelings for not knocking on our neighbours’ doors and for not bringing my phone out with me as that would have allowed me to call people I knew in the tower to tell them to get out,” she said.The feelings of helplessness and guilt “will stay with me forever”, she added.In her final remarks to the inquiry, Ms Dagnachew said: “There’s been one burning question which has been with me since I have heard the earliest firefighters’ evidence.“How is it that the incident commander did not know that fire was raging through flats as well, not just on the outside?” she asked.The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has been criticised for initially telling residents to remain in their flats despite the speed and ferocity of the blaze’s spread.The basis of the stay-put policy is that fire should not spread between compartments, so a person in an unaffected part of the building should be able to remain in their flat and await rescue safely.This was changed almost two hours after the fire started.Hiwot Dagnachew crying at the Grenfell Inquiry when she asks why the stay put policy was not changedMs Dagnachew said she first became aware of the fire at about 1.15am and had fled the building within minutes, telling a firefighter on the way down that it had spread to her flat.She continued: “This was very early in the night and so many people could have been evacuated.“We’ve lost so many people because they were told to stay put.”“I was waiting for my friends, for my neighbours to come out.“Why was the policy not changed early on? Why were no people evacuated early on?”Inquiry chair Sir Martin Moore-Bick responded: “Well it’s an important question and one which we will do our very best to answer.”Created with Sketch.Grenfell Tower Inquiry: photos of inside the flat where fire began Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Kitchen in flat 16 where the fire startedThe kitchen from flat 16The kitchen from flat 16Hallway in flat 16, leading to the kitchen where the fire startedThe kitchen from flat 16The kitchen from flat 16Bedroom in flat 16Living room in flat 16Toilet in flat 16Living room in flat 16Bedroom 2 of flat 16Bedroom in flat 16Bedroom 2 of flat 16The kitchen from flat 16Kitchen in flat 16 where the fire startedDoor to flat 16 from the lobby on floor 4Living room in flat 16Hallway in flat 16Kitchen in flat 16 where the fire startedThe kitchen from flat 16The kitchen from flat 16Hallway in flat 16, leading to the kitchen where the fire startedThe kitchen from flat 16The kitchen from flat 16Bedroom in flat 16Living room in flat 16Toilet in flat 16Living room in flat 16Bedroom 2 of flat 16Bedroom in flat 16Bedroom 2 of flat 16The kitchen from flat 16Kitchen in flat 16 where the fire startedDoor to flat 16 from the lobby on floor 4Living room in flat 16Hallway in flat 16The inquiry also heard from Maher Khoudair, who was given a ninth-floor flat in the council block, despite needing crutches to walk.\u0026nbspHe recalled people pushing past him as he struggled to get out of the tower on the night of the blaze.“No one helped me. I was sitting on the stairs to rest before carrying on. I made sure my back was away from the stair rail so people could get past and not push me,” he said in a written statement that was translated from his native Arabic.He said he thought:\u0026nbsp“‘I am going to be pushed and fall head first on the stairs and be trampled on.

They kicked the door down.\u0026nbsp“They led me out in handcuffs and put me in a detention centre for two days. Obviously I was frantic.\u0026nbspI had panic attacks in the car.“For the next eight months I wasn’t allowed to work.\u0026nbspI had to go and sign on every two weeks. I got into\u0026nbsprent arrears. My mum had to take on another job to help me.\u0026nbspWe were frantic. We were paying solicitor fees, lawyer fees, trying to get it sorted.”After eight tumultuous months,\u0026nbspMr Azolukwam was told the letter had been a mistake. His first priority was to start working again – but his optimism was short lived.“I hadn’t been working for so long. I wasn’t trying to get out there immediately, get a job, try sort my life out,” he said.\u0026nbsp“And then all of a sudden, two or three weeks ago, they sent me a letter again. It said you’re not allowed to work, you are notified you don’t have indefinite leave, you’re not allowed benefits. The exact same letter as before.“It was like deja vu.\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspdidn’t know where to turn.\u0026nbspI thought it was all going to happen again. I just felt like I was being targeted.He added: “The amount of stress it’s caused me. I’ve got very high blood pressure. I just want it all to stop. I just want them to\u0026nbspleave me\u0026nbspalone,\u0026nbsplet me\u0026nbspcarry on with my\u0026nbsplife. I’ve never had a\u0026nbspproblem\u0026nbspgetting jobs\u0026nbspI don’t have a criminal record or anything like that. But I now have £5,000 worth of rent arrears because of the eight months when I wasn’t allowed to work.Government admits 63 Windrush citizens could have wrongly deportedThe most humiliating thing was having to rely on my mum.\u0026nbspThere’s nothing worse than this. She had to take on two jobs.\u0026nbspI just want to be left alone and live my life. I don’t want police kicking at my door, I don’t want any of this. Even now, to this day, until I see another letter confirming, I’m still worried it\u0026nbsphasn’t been sorted out.”Mr Lammy, whose intervention prompted the Home Office to admit they made an error on both occasions, said the way the 36 year old\u0026nbsphad been treated\u0026nbspwas “beyond comprehension”.“Following his incorrect imprisonment in a detention centre, and an apology from the Immigration Minister, Franklin had begun to stitch his life back together, said the Labour MP.\u0026nbsp“To receive yet another letter, after this, declaring him invalid to work or study in the UK and threatening yet more detention, tore his life into pieces once again.Even despite numerous scandals this year, the Home Office continues to be rotten with incompetence. Franklin deserves another apology and serious compensation for the trauma he has been put through.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Scotland\u0027s First Minister and leader of the Scottish National Party, Nicola Sturgeon acknowledges the applause as she delivers her keynote speech to delegates on the final day of the SNP annual conference in Glasgow Anna Richardson and Alastair Campbell pose with their portraits at Let\u0027s Talk, a photography exhibition created in partnership with Mental Health UK at Regent\u0027s Place in London.

As well as Ms Coffey, Claire Perry, a middle-ranking minister at the business department who oversees climate change policy also attended.\u0026nbspBut Mr Gove\u0027s\u0026nbspnon-attendance at Tuesday’s important meeting following the IPCC report recommending “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society” angered environmentalists, who said his “failure to engage” was damning and showed the limited extent of the government\u0027s ambitions.European ministers used the meeting to adopt a tougher position on climate change emphasising “the unprecedented urgency which is needed to step up global efforts to avoid the dangerous effects of climate change” and to work on new CO2 emissions standards for cars across the bloc.Michael Gove\u0027s failure to engage with the EU Environment Council tells us everything we need to know about whether they plan to take the urgent action necessary to avoid disaster.It came after Monday’s report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said\u0026nbspthat the planet would reach the crucial 1.5C warming as early as 2030 under current greenhouse gas emission levels: risking wildfires, extreme droughts, floods, and serious famine.Green MP Caroline Lucas told The Independent: “Yesterday\u0027s IPCC report exposed the Government\u0027s approach to tackling climate change as completely inadequate. Michael Gove\u0027s failure to engage with the EU Environment Council tells us everything we need to know about whether they plan to take the urgent action necessary to avoid disaster.“With just 12 years left to turn things around, we need an environment secretary dedicated to working across borders to create a fairer, healthier, safer society – not a self-promoting architect of an environmentally destructive Brexit.”Dave\u0026nbspTimms, Friends of the Earth’s head of politics,\u0026nbspsaid: “Hopefully Mr Gove is reading in-depth the hundreds of pages of evidence the IPCC published yesterday.“He would do well to give particular consideration to achieving net zero greenhouse gases, and the critical role that afforestation and farming has to play in achieving that.”The Environment Secretary\u0027s poor reputation at\u0026nbspEU level\u0026nbsptraces back to\u0026nbsphis conduct during the 2016 referendum campaign. In June,\u0026nbspthe EU\u0027s agriculture commissioner, Phil Hogan, who works on the same policy patch as Mr Gove, accused the minister by name of “deception and lies” during the EU referendum campaign.Arriving at the summit in his absence, Mr Gove’s counterparts from around the EU warned that Monday’s IPCC report showed the continent needed to step up its ambition.Stientje van Veldhoven, the Dutch cabinet minister for the environment, said:\u0026nbsp“I think it’s very clear that the\u0026nbspIPCC\u0026nbspgave us a very strong signal. If we want to attain the Paris goals then we need to step up our ambitions.”Created with Sketch.

The electoral consequences could be dire.“So it is in both the party’s interest, and crucially the national interest, that we reset our negotiating strategy immediately and deliver a Brexit that meets the demands of the referendum and the interests of the British people.”Later on Tuesday, Mr Raab told MPs\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbsptalks with Brussels have “intensified” in recent weeks, with both sides are “closing in workable solutions” to all the outstanding issues, including the deadlock over the Irish border.He stood firm against Brexiteers who urged him to ditch the Chequers plan in favour of their preferred Canada-style model, which he claimed was a “shortcut” to crashing out of the EU without a deal.However he faced criticism from former Tory\u0026nbsphome secretary Amber Rudd over\u0026nbspthe government’s\u0026nbsp”gung-ho approach” to no deal, as she warned that security matters are not yet in place to keep the UK safe.Fears rat hair and maggots may appear in UK food after BrexitMordaunt said Brexit was ‘a noble and hopeful act’. Come off it22 Brexit terms everyone’s using but you were too afraid to ask aboutDowning Street says EU too ‘optimistic’ that a Brexit deal is closeAt the Tory conference last week, the prime minister – for the first time – opened up the possibility that Brexit could be halted, unless the Tories stopped fighting each other.But Mr Davis urged her not to make “preposterous threats” that a refusal by Tory MPs to back her could result in Brexit being lost altogether, or watered down by the need for Labour votes.Although the EU has offered “Canada-plus-plus-plus”, it has insisted Northern Ireland would then have to stay in the customs union and part of the single market\u0026nbspto avoid a hard border – a suggestion that Mr Davis and other pro-Brexit Tories would never accept.Earlier, Steve Baker, Mr Davis’s former deputy, repeated his warning that up to 80 Tories are ready to vote down the government’s proposals.Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, said: “David Davis’s letter highlights the growing panic rippling through the Conservative party that Theresa May’s Brexit is going to cause nothing but misery for the country and the Tory party.“People should not have to cross their fingers and hope for the Tory party to sort out this terrible mess they have got the country into.“Instead the people should get the final say on the deal and the option to remain in the EU.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Thanks for following!That\u0027s the end of Dominic Raab\u0027s statement in the Commons.\u0026nbspThe best bits were when he categorically ruled out an indefinite customs union to resolve Irish border difficulties in the Brexit talks.The Brexit Secretary told MPs that talks with the EU have intensified in recent weeks and the two sides are closing in on workable solutions to all of the key outstanding issues before urging Brussels to match the UK\u0027s ambitions and pragmatism.Labour accused Mr\u0026nbspRaab\u0026nbspof pretending that everything is going according to plan and urged him to scotch rumours that the Government is not intending to publish an Irish border backstop proposal by next week, before questioning if an indefinite UK-wide customs union would be part of the offer.Boris Johnson is in the chamber for Dominic Raab\u0027s statement but he is not seeking to catch the speaker\u0027s eye to ask a question.\u0026nbspPerhaps he has run out of things to say on Brexit?Pro-EU Labour MP Chris Leslie asked if the prospect of a blind Brexit was being ruled out. This is the scenario\u0026nbspwhere the broader exit terms are agreed but the detail is left until later, which Brexiteers hate.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMr Leslie asks if the meaningful vote in parliament will have precise information on the deal.\u0026nbspMr Raab said there must not be a \u0027blindfolded Brexit and said the government wants MPs to have the right information to make a decisions.DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds declared it was\u0026nbsp“rubbish” to say a backstop was needed to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. He repeated his stance that the DUP\u0026nbspwill not tolerate anything that separates Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.Mr Raab said the government will honour all the commitments it made in December and pledged not to\u0026nbspdo anything that would threaten the integrity of the UK.Several senior\u0026nbspTory MPs have raised concerns about the Brexit preparations.\u0026nbspEx-home secretary Amber Rudd warned about\u0026nbspthe “somewhat gung-ho” approach to security matters in a no deal\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspthat the government is adopting.Mr Raab replied that the UK could impose new border checks because it would no longer be bound by EU rules.Raab said Brexit negotiations with the EU had intensified in recent weeks.He added: On the withdrawal agreement, while there remains some differences, we are closing in on workable solutions to all of the key outstanding issues, building on the progress we made during the summer on issues such as data and information, the treatment of ongoing police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters and ongoing union judicial administrative procedures after the date of exit.We have also been discussing our proposals on the linkage needed between the withdrawal agreement and the future relationship, and the EU is engaging constructively.Raab says it is not protocol for the PM to update the House. He adds the October council will be an important milestone and some important progress will be made.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspKeir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, says can he politely point out that it would have been better for the PM to be in her place providing the update on the Brexit negations.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt should be the PM in Parliament this afternoon explaining what went wrong, he says.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe says the statement is like groundhog day with no substantive progress outlined in Mr Raab\u0027s comments.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSir Keir says the secretary previously said a deal would be reached by the October summit - next week. He asks when the government will lay a meaningful vote on the deal before Parliament so MPs can vote.\u0026nbspHe says he would happily swap sides and take control of the negotiations. Emily Thornberry shouts move over\u0026nbspBrexit secretary, Dominic Raab, is now speaking in the Commons. He says over the recess break we have been engaging constructively with Brussels.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe says he will not accept any deal that damages the constitutional integrity of the UK - repeating Theresa May\u0027s earlier remarks about any customs barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\u0026nbspWe understand the EU raised some concerns, he says. We continue to engage constructively with the EU.\u0026nbspWe should hold our nerve, he adds, claiming the government hopes to achieve a deal this autumn.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt\u0027s time for the EU to match the ambition and pragmatism we have shown, Raab says.\u0026nbspHe says the government has published 52 technical notes over the summer, outlining preparations for the potential of no-deal scenarios.Labour\u0027s Melanie Onn, who secured the urgent question, asked why environment secretary Michael Gove was not in the Commons to defend the policy if the government consider it so important.\u0026nbspShe asks \u0027Must it always take a tragedy to affect meaningful change from this government?\u0027\u0026nbspBetter food labelling needs to be at the top of his to do list, she says.Jumping back to the Commons, MPs are just moving onto an urgent question on allergy-related\u0026nbspdeaths. It comes after two people are believed to have died after suffering a reaction to Pret A Manger sandwiches.\u0026nbspEnvironment minister David Rutley said the deaths of Celia Marsh and\u0026nbspNatasha Ednan-Laperouse were deeply upsetting and said his heart went out to their families.\u0026nbspInvestigations are ongoing into Ms Marsh\u0027s death so it would be inappropriate to comment he said, but the government takes food labelling extremely seriously.\u0026nbspHe said the parents of Ms Ednan-Laperouse have made a powerful case for change and the government is working \u0027at pace\u0027 to review the current rules.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The electoral consequences could be dire, Mr Davis wrote.So it is in both the party\u0027s interest, and crucially in the national interest, that we reset out negotiating strategy immediately and deliver a Brexit that meets the demands of the referendum and the interests of the British people.President of the European Council Donald Tusk and Theresa May at Downing Street (Image: Leon Neal - WPA PoolGetty Images)Mr David\u0027s letter urged the Prime Minister to dump the proposals for a deal agreed by the Cabinet at her Chequers country in July and push for a deal similar to Canada\u0027s free trade arrangements with the EU.He said the Chequers proposal fails to take back control of our laws, money, borders and trade because was based on a common rulebook for trade in goods, close customs links and effective subordination to the European Court of Justice.Brussels had already offered a Canada-style deal, the former Cabinet minister said.The prize is on offer and the EU is saying it is ready to make that deal, Mr Davis wrote, adding that the row over the Northern Irish border was a red herring because nobody in the negotiations wanted full border checks imposed between the province and the Irish Republic.It is clear that a deal which honours the referendum result, is negotiable with the EU and which would reunite our party is within our grasp with political will and imagination, he said.In response Mr Davis\u0027s letter, the Prime Minister\u0027s spokesman said: The simple point I would make is that a Canada-style deal for the entire UK is not on offer from the EU. What is on offer is free-trade agreement that covers Great Britain only - Northern Ireland would be kept inside the customs union and parts of the single market, effectively iding the UK in two.As the Prime Minister and many others have said, that is unacceptable.Prime Minister delivers her speech at the Conservative Party Conference (Image:  Christopher FurlongGetty Images)Earlier yesterday, former Brexit minister Steve Baker warned that at least 40 Tory MPs were ready to rebel against the Prime Minister\u0027s Chequers plans.He feared the proposals would leave the UK half in, half out of the EU.Such a revolt would lead to the plans being rejected by the Commons unless dozens of Labour MPs could be persuaded to support the Prime Minister\u0027s plans.Mr Baker, a senior figure in the hardline Brexiteer European Research Group, told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: The whips would be doing incredibly well if they were to halve the numbers.My estimate is that there are at least 40 colleagues who are not going to accept a half-in, half-out Chequers deal or indeed a backstop that leaves us in the internal market and the customs union, come what may.Tory former chief whip Mark Harper warned that relying on Labour voters would not work.Mr Harper, who was a Home Office minister during Mrs May\u0027s tenure in the department, said: We are going to have to carry this deal on our own benches. If you\u0027re the Prime Minister, you do have to listen to colleagues.In a sign of Cabinet isions over the Chequers proposals, International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who campaigned for Leave in the referendum, yesterday suggested the plan could be changed as the negotiations reached a climax.Theresa May in the cabinet (Image: hristopher Furlong - WPA PoolGetty Images)We don\u0027t know where this is going to end up, she said.Answering questions following a speech in London, Ms Mordaunt said: The Prime Minister can count on my support.But what I would say is that we don\u0027t know where this is going to end up. We are at a critical moment now. The ball is firmly back in the EU\u0027s court. We are waiting for them to respond.\u0026nbsp            "},{"url":null,"title":"royal","story":"THE second royal wedding of the year is just around the corner, as Princess Eugenie prepares to...PRINCESS Eugenie could have saved the taxpayer £2million by holding her wedding at a royal...MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry managed to fight against the odds and maintain a long-distance...A ROYAL reunion between Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew could hinge on their daughter\u0027s wedding...PRINCE Harry “wants a baby” etiquette expert Liz Brewer has claimed, as both he and Meghan...PRINCE Harry and Meghan Markle can finally move into their sprawling 21-room Kensington Palace...The Duchess of Sussex rushed to the aid of a young girl who stood crying after being pushed over...MEGHAN Markle has been married to husband Prince Harry for almost 5 months now and royal fans...SARAH Ferguson has been sharing her excitement at her daughter Princess Eugenie tying the knot...MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry are set to make a very significant visit during their first..."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/590x/the-queen-eugenie-1028979.jpg","title":"the queen news london buckingham palace princess eugenie royal wedding","story":"Ladbrokes has officially released odds on what colour the Queen\u0026rsquos hat will be  (Image: )The 92-year-old monarch was back to work at Buckingham Palace today following her annual break at Balmoral in the Scottish Highlands.Though the yearly holiday is not entirely a break for Her Majesty, who is known to spend much of her time avidly reading Government papers on a daily basis.The Queen\u0026rsquos return to London comes as wedding fever hits Windsor in the days leading up to Princess Eugenie\u0027s upcoming nuptials.Royal Windsor has since been peppered with Union Jack bunting in a bid to welcome not onlythe Queen\u0027s 28-year-old granddaughter and her future husband Jack Brooksbank, to St George\u0026rsquos Chapel, but also the thousands of royal fans who will line the streets to bid them congratulations as they ride a horse and carriage down the cobbled streets.

I believe in the UK and therefore I want to protect that.\u0026ldquoWhat happens in five years, 10, 20 years, we do not want Northern Ireland going off in a different direction than the rest of the UK.Prior to her meetings, she said: \u0026ldquoWe want the June 2016 referendum result to be respected and implemented.\u0026ldquoA majority of people throughout the United Kingdom voted to take back control of their money, laws, and borders. Whilst many in Brussels may not agree with the referendum outcome, the result must be respected.\u0026ldquoAs we leave the EU, we should do so as one nation.

But this is the reality of trying to save up for a house.They work hard each month. They’d love to put something aside to save up for a home.But to live where there are good jobs, they have to spend so much on high rents that there’s nothing left over.So they can never save enough to break out of the cycle. No wonder they are frustrated.New figures show how bad things have got. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says four out of ten people in the  to -year-old age bracket couldn’t afford the mortgage on even the cheapest house in their area, eventhey had a deposit.The gap between prices and normal people’s earnings is just too big, because since  house prices in Britain have gone up more than in any other developed country.Expensive housing has meant that the proportion of young people on middle incomes who own their own home has collapsed: down from nearly two thirds  years ago, to just over a quarter today.We have to turn this round and restore home ownership.Many people feel they can’t get on and start a family until they have a nest of their own. Their lives are on hold.Politically it’s vital too. If young people don’t feel they’ve got a chance to get on in le, they are more likely to gamble and vote for extreme, disastrous politicians like Jeremy Corbyn.Even younger people who are earning decent wages feel squeezed, because they face a combination of high house prices and chunky repayments on their student loans.The Prime Minister is acutely aware of this. That’s why she’s set up a review of student fees, and moved to make housing her Number  priority other than Brexit.Hence her announcement of massive funding to build more affordable housing for people on lower incomes. But there’s much more to do.Building more homes for people to buy is a big part of the answer. Since  we have built only half as many houses as France each year, and so house prices have gone up twice as fast.Some people say building more means we must tear up the planning system and concrete over the countryside.But we know that approach won’t work. When Gordon Brown was PM we tried setting each area massive housing targets. All those targets built was resentment. We need a smarter approach to tackle the reasons people often oppose new housing.We build in the wrong places. Instead of tacking on new estates to existing towns and villages without enough new school places or parking places, let’s get back into the business of building planned new cities and towns.Let’s build upwards in our city centres with taller buildings, rather than just sprawling cities outwards.What drives people mad is seeing developers make massive windfall profits when they get planning permission, but then not sharing those benefits with local residents.Imagine instead,new houses being built next door always paid for people in neighbouring streets to get cheap homes for their children to buy. People would feel much better about development.Restoring the dream of home ownership isn’t just about building more houses though.We need to think about the balance of rented properties and home ownership. Over the last ten years we’ve built many new homes each year, but the number of homeowners fell. How come The reason is that the number of properties being snapped up by buy-to-let landlords has grown faster than we have built new ones.Don’t get me wrong. Landlords, who have themselves worked hard, weren’t doing anything wrong.Butwe want to get home ownership growing again we need to encourage savers to put their money into shares and into growing businesses rather than just bidding up the price of houses. The think tank Onward proposed this week that we should offer a tax break to landlords who sell their homes to their tenants.This “Chance to Buy” would be a bit like the Right to Buy Margaret Thatcher introduced for council tenants. It could be paid for by tax changes which would discourage people from buying up new buy-to-let properties.So fewer landlords, more homeowners.Young people just want the same chances previous generations enjoyed. So let’s build more by building smarter, and give a new generation the chance to buy a home.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you’re the Prime Minister you do have to listen to colleagues.With just days left to go for Mrs May to get a deal with the bloc, there was hope at the end of last week that an agreement was close.However, Mrs May put on the brakes yesterday, accusing the EU of blocking progress.“Big issues” still remain to be resolved and that still “requires movement on the EU side”, No insisted.Which would mean Britain would have to secure an extension to Article  to make it work.The country is set to officially leave the EU on March  next year, when a transition agreement is set to kick in.The boffins at UCL say there are several points another referendum could happen - but it wont be able to happen until at least May .Any chance of another vote to delay our exit will infuriate Brexiteers - and the  million Brits who opted to quit the bloc back in the historic  referendum.Theres still the possibility that a deal cant be reached between Brussels at the UK.Today the International Monetary Fund demanded that Philip Hammond loosen the purse strings and get spending in the event that happens.The IMF said: At a time of heightened uncertainty, monetary policy should remain flexible in response to changing conditions associated with the Brexit negotiation.The guidance from the fund contradicts what the Chancellor has told the rest of the cabinet - that there isnt much he can do to stop the fall outwe were to leave the bloc without an agreement.Mrs May is holding out for “a precise future framework” from Brussels over the shape of the UK-EU trade deal to avoid a ‘blind Brexit’.She needs to get an agreement  by next weeks European Council Summit to try and get the deal signed off by all the other EU nations in time for our official exit in March .But an emergency summit has already been pencilled in for next month in case the details cant be ironed out.The thorny issue of the Northern Irish border after Brexit is causing the biggest headaches - as ministers try to ensure there is no hard border, but also allow Northern Ireland to leave the EU too.Ireland and the UK are in a common travel area of passport-free movement.And as they are both in the EU single market, there is no restriction on goods and no tarfs.Leaders in London, Belfast, Dublin and Brussels are keen to avoid a hard border after Brexit — when the UK has vowed to leave the single market and customs union.This would mean border checks being reintroduced to monitor movement between jurisdictions operating under the two dferent regulatory systems.There were fears this could have jeopardised the Good Friday Agreement peace deal.But putting Northern Ireland under a similar regime to the rest of Ireland would split the North up from the UK.The DUP - Theresa Mays close allies - wont stand for this and would withdraw their support for her governmentshe abandoned them.Today Mrs Mays Northern Irish allies, the DUP, travel to Brussels to meet the EUs chief negotiator Michel Barnier for further talks on how to resolve the impasse.They wont accept anything which involves new checks and splits them up from the rests of the UK and puts a virtual border in the Irish sea.The United Kingdom single market must be protected with no new borders between Northern Ireland and Great Britain being created, she said last night.

Last week, Banksy destroyed one of his prints via a remote device seconds after it sold in London. Auction house Sothebys admitted being Banksy-ed when a canvas of Girl With Balloon self-destructed the moment it sold for pound. million on Friday night. The art collector hoped by copying the prank, he would double the prints value.  But it has now been valued to be worth less than pound. And experts have now warned people not to repeat the prank. A blog post on MyArtBroker reads: Weve had a number of Banksy print owners contact us today askingthey shred their artwork will it be worth more. Please, please dont. The events of the last hrs are a very unique piece of art history. On Saturday evening, Banksy posted a video on his Instagram page which showed a shredder being fitted to the frame of his painting. It opened with the caption: A few years ago, I secretly built a shredder into a painting.  The clip shows a hooded figure putting the finishing touches on the device, before text appears on the screen saying: In case it was ever put up for auction. Camera-phone footage from inside the auction house in London then follows, capturing the moment a beeping siren sounded as the gavel hits. The stencil spray paining - which depicts a girl reaching towards a heart-shaped balloon - suddenly passes through the covert shredder and hangs limply from the bottom. Two attendants are shown rushing over to remove the painting from its fitting and take it away. Earlier on Saturday, Banksy had posted a picture of the stunts aftermath with the caption: Going, going, gone...  The pound. million sale of Girl With Balloon was the last lot of the night and equalled Banksys previous auction record.

The Bristol-born artist is revered for his subversive work, but, despite rampant speculation, has never officially revealed his identity. He came to prominence through a series of satirical graffiti pieces that appeared on buildings across the country.

Claudia Patatas, , and Adam Thomas, , gave their son the middle name ‘Adolf’ in tribute to the Nazi leader, it is claimed. They allowed a National Action member to pose next to the newborn tot holding a Swastika flag and making a “Hitler salute”, jurors were told. The couple, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, are accused of having a “fanatical and tribal belief” in white supremacy. National Action was founded in  and deemed a terrorist organisation by then-Home Secretary Amber Rudd in .  She describ British baby named after ADOLF HITLER by parents who were members of banned neo-Nazi group National Action ed it as a “racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic organisation” which promotes a “vile ideology”. Patatas, Thomas and fellow defendant Daniel Bogunovic, , are alleged to have been members before and after its ban. Prosecutor Barnaby Jameson told jurors at Birmingham crown court the trio believed in “White Jihad”. He said: “This case is about a specic type of terror. It is a terror fuelled by hatred and ision. “It is a terror born out of fanatical and tribal belief in white supremacy, spread by a small cell of fanatics. “It is a terror that regards anyone who falls outside a cult of violent white racial supremacy as ‘sub-human.’ “Those that fall into the ‘sub-human’ category are primarily blacks, Jews and Asians. “Others include gays, communists and feminists. The cult had particular venom for female Labour MPs perceived as sympathetic to migrants.  “It is a terror that can be summarised in two words: ‘White Jihad’ – a white holy war. “The world into which this case will take you is a world in which any right-thinking person would wish did not exist. “It is a world beyond casual racist abuse. It is a world of banner-carrying para-militaries aping Hitler’s SS. “It is a world of Swastikas and the burning crosses of the Ku Klux Klan. It is the world a group called ‘Nation Action’. “It is the world of a group so extreme and violent the government banned it.” Mr Jameson said Patatas and Thomas’s son was born in late  - nearly a year after National Action was banned. He told the jury: “The couple have a small male child. One of his middle names was ‘Adolf.’ “Given the child was born almost a year after the ban, you may think the use of the name ‘Adolf’, even as a middle name, was of signicance.” Jurors were told about a photo of convicted National Action member Darren Fletcher posing with Patatas’s baby while making a Nazi salute. Mr Jameson said: “Fletcher was a vehement Nazi.  “In  he went on stage at an extreme right event dressed in KKK robes hanging a golliwog from a noose. “He placed the footage on YouTube. That stunt earned him a conviction for stirring up racial hatred. “He was a close friend of Thomas and Patatas. “The case ultimately is about a group that, in a convicted member’s own words, shed one skin for another. “When National Action was banned it simply rebranded and continued in the shadows. It put on disguise after disguise. “It is a group of vehement Neo-Nazis, glorying Hitler and the Third Reich. “Openly and aggressively Nazi, it is anti-black, anti-Semitic, anti-Islamic and anti-gay. “National Action is the only fascist group to be banned since World War II.” The court heard how the defendants were in close contact with National Action members Alexander Deakin, , and Mikko Vehvilainen, . They were also allegedly associated with “zealot” Jack Coulson, , who branded the killer of Labour MP Jo Cox “f ** legend”. He wrote on Facebook about Thomas Mair: “He’s a hero. We need more people like him to butcher the race traitors.” Patatas and Thomas were arrested at their home under terrorism legislation in January. The couple and Bogunovic, from Leicester, deny being members of a proscribed organisation. Thomas also faces a charge relating to possessing items which could be used to commit a terrorist act. Jurors were told Bogunovic was convicted of stirring up racial hatred after defacing a university with National Action stickers. The trial continues.

Caragh Walsh died in Belfasts Royal Victoria Hospital two days after paramedics were called to her home on February , . Her father Christopher ONeill always denied harming his daughter and was cleared of murder by a jury in . Coroner Joe McCrisken found that the cause of death had been hypoxic ischaemic necrosis due to cardio-respiratory arrest, cerebral oedema and spinal haemorrhage due to violent shaking. Caraghs mother Tammie-Louise Walsh and a number of other family members wept as the findings were read out. Mr ONeill also attended the hearing. Mr McCrisken warned those present at Belfast Coroners Court that he intended to read his y findings to silence, and that anyone who interrupted risked being held in contempt of court and taken to the cells.  He described the inquest as sensitive and distressing. The events of  February  have irrevocably changed the lives of the Walsh and ONeill families for the rest of their lives, Mr McCrisken told the inquest. A tiny baby closed her eyes forever and that tragedy shall weigh heavily on both Mr ONeill and Ms Walsh for the rest of their lives. Neither will fully recover from Caraghs death. Mr McCrisken cautioned that an inquest in Northern Ireland cannot apportion blame, express any opinion on civil or criminal liability, ora finding of unlawful killing. An inquest is a fact-finding inquiry and not a method of apportioning guilt, he said. This inquest is not a retrial of Mr ONeill. Mr McCrisken summarised evidence that Caragh had woken and fed as normal before being left in the sole care of her father.  Hetold the jury at his trial that Caragh was asleep in her bouncer while he was watching a DVD, Mr McCrisken said. He said that she woke up crying. He described a painful cry. He lted her and rocked her gently in his arms. At some point during this he said he noticed that Caragh was having dficulty breathing. He gave police a detailed account of how he shook Caragh in an attempt to rouse her. He described the force used as a five on a scale of one to . Mr ONeill called  for an ambulance. The inquest heard a recording of the call. Caragh died two days later in hospital. Mr McCrisken dismissed a suggestion made during Mr ONeills trial by a medical witness that Caragh had suffered from rickets. He accepted medical evidence that Caraghs bones had been healthy. He also said he was satisfied that Caragh had suffered injuries to her rib, leg and elbow approximately seven to  days before her death. He noted in particular that the injury to her elbow was extremely serious and must have required an exceptional degree of force.  Mr McCrisken found that Caragh had suffered a cardio-respiratory arrest on February  due to being shaken violently and with extreme force. There was no other reason for the cardio-respiratory arrest. I am satisfied that Caragh was shaken at least once, but probably on more than one occasion, he said. The injuries to Caraghs brain and eyes required a rapid and substantial acceleration and deceleration of her head and neck. I am satisfied that violent shaking caused bilateral bleeds to Caraghs brain as well as severe retinal bleeding and bleeding around the optic nerve. The subsequent lack of oxygen and blood flow cause cerebral oedema and irreversible brain damage. Mr McCrisken paid tribute to the medical staff who tried to save Caragh as having delivered exemplary care. Over the past four years they have been questioned about their actions and behaviour, subjected to cross-examination about their observations and treatment and criticised about their motivation, he said. In my opinion, no criticism of the medical team at the Roya Victoria Hospital or those paramedics who treated Caragh is justied.Speaking outside court, Stephen Tumelty, counsel for Ms Walsh, told the Press Association she and her family were happy with the findings. They feel that justice has been served at last, he said.

Martin says the family will be holding a private memorial for Corrie in the near future. It came after police released a statement saying they believe Corrie was taken away in a Bfa bin and to the rubbish tip in Milton, Cambridgeshire, after climbing into a skip and falling asleep.  Mr McKeague said on Facebook yesterday: The police have confirmed the Bfa bin weight that suggests my son ended up in the Suffolk waste disposal system. They also confirmed that there is no new evidence whatsoever. Whatever anyone has read in the newspapers to suggest otherwise is a lie. My son is gone and the McKeague family in Scotland will be holding a private memorial for him in the near future. Thank you all again for standing up and standing by us.  Suffolk Police recently attended a meeting with Bfa, which confirmed the weight of the bin that was picked up from outside Greggs in the Horseshoe area of Bury St Edmunds on September  when Corrie went missing. They believed he climbed into the waste bin and fell asleep and the data showed the bin weighed kg - much higher than bin collection weights from the same place normally. In a statement Suffolk Police said: We reviewed the data for September  in particular and I remain confident that the bin did weigh kg as previously stated. We then went onto identy the weights of the Greggs bin which was collected each Saturday during the period of January  and February .  Our findings were that the weights of these bins were consistently lowand it was extremely unusual for the Greggs bin collection on a Saturday to be anywhere near KG let alone over this figure. In the whole of this yearly period we identied only one other occasion where the weight exceeded kg, other than a date where a system error had occurred which recorded a weight in excess of KG which is known to be impossible. As stated earlier, all this information has been held within this enquiry and previously reviewed. There is no new evidence that has come to light as a result of this meeting.  As the SIO for the investigation into Corries disappearance, I am now completely satisfied that the data provided by Bfa can be relied upon, as can the kg recorded weight of the Greggs Bin collected on September . This investigation has found no other reasonable explanation for that unusually high bin weight, thus when this data is considered alongside the other evidence held within this enquiry it confirms and consolidates my view that the preferred outcome and finding of this investigation is that during the early hours Corrie came to be in the bin that was collected by the Bfa lorry and was transported away.  Meanwhile, Corries mum Nicola Urquhart revealed this afternoon her disappointment police took so long to eliminate McDonalds man - a man they released CCTV pictures of in March  entering the fast food restaurant - from their enquiries. Nicola said: I do not know how long ago the police decided this person was no longer of interest and they dont want them identied. I do believe they have had no interest for over a year. I am going to try and find this person myself as the police obviously felt there was a reason to share the photo of this person and ask for help at one point.  It feels to me that a reasonable thing to do was follow up on information provided. Suffolk and Norfolk police previously spent  days looking for Corrie at the Milton tip and trawled through more than , tonnes of rubbish. In March this year they announced his disappearance had been moved to the major investigation cold case team.  Corrie was last seen in the area of Bury St Edmunds known as the horseshoe where there was a bin lorry collection at around .am to .am on Saturday,  September, . Only one bin was collected from the area that morning. Waste from it was initially taken to a transfer station at Red Lodge and then to the Milton landfill site. Milton landfill site is around , square metres. The original -week search for Corrie was stopped in July  after nothing was found. Officers searched through more than , tonnes of waste during this time, at a cost of pound.million.

After its closure, Earlham Primary declared itself spider free and has since reopened. A Newham Council spokeswoman said last week the affected schools were being treated and cleared. She said: We are working with them to ensure children continue to get an education while their schools are closed. We are asking all our schools and nurseries to proactively check their premises carefully for these spiders. If they see any signs, then contact environmental health or pest control as well as notying the council.  David Cross, head of Technical Training Academy at Rentokil Pest Control, said the spiders have been around for some time. He said: False Widow Spiders have brown bulbous abdomens with pale markings, and the females can grow up to mm. The spiders will only bite humansthey become frightened, orthey are accidentally provoked or squeezed. Their venom can make children ill, but bites in adults will usually only cause a temporary pain and swelling.

But in  another of the Queens daughter-in-laws was making headlines around the world - and Dianas cheeky response sums it up perfectly.Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, and Prince Andrew had announced their separation in March . She remained firmly part of the family and was staying at Balmoral with the Queen, her children Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, and other Royals when compromising photographs of her were published in the Daily Mirror . In the images, Fergie, as she is more commonly known, was having her toes kissed and sucked by her financial advisor John Bryan, a Texan billionaire. The photos, taken at a villa in the south of France, show the couple frolicking in the pool and kissing. A young Princess Eugenie, then just two years old, watches on as Bryan plants a kiss on her mothers lips.  The scandal was a headache the Royal family did not need in a year the Queen dubbed her annus horribilis. But Princess Diana had a cheeky reaction to news of the images existence the night before they hit newspaper stands. She reportedly sent a message via pager to royal reporter and author Richard Kay, which consisted of just four words: The redheads in trouble.  One might argue Princess Diana was responsible for the marriage between Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew. The couple had known each other as children, with Sarah revealing in an interview they were two like-minded truants who would play tag. But they grew apart as they got older - until Princess Diana invited her friend Sarah to a party and she was reunited with Prince Andrew once again, which led to the pair dating and later marrying. Five years after the photo scandal, and just months before her tragic death, photographs of Diana on holiday in St Tropez with lover Dodi al Fayed were circulated in the worlds press, echoing those of Fergie and Bryan.

School chiefs claim they want to help cash-strapped families save money by telling all parents to kit their children out in casual sportswear. If the plans are approved, pupils will wear blue-and-white tracksuit bottoms and a hoodie top emblazoned with the school crest. The current policy of pupils wearing black shoes will also be ditched in favour of non-branded white or black trainers. Parents have been asked to vote on the proposals - which have the backing of governors - which could come into force next year. Telford Junior School, in Leamington Spa, Warks., says the new unorm would consist of tracksuit bottoms, trainers, white sports socks, hoodie or zoodie in school colours with the school logo.  Last week headteacher Richard Siviter wrote to parents, saying: This unorm would be worn throughout the day, without the need to change into games kit for PE games lessons. Lists the advantages of the sportswear unorm, Mr Siviter claims it simplies the school unorm and reduces costs to families. It also says it will save valuable lesson time and overcomes the issue of changing in school and reduces lost property while maintaining a unorm code.  But parents have reacted with outrage at the plans, saying tracksuits will lower standards and sends out the wrong message to pupils. Mum-of-two Michelle Jackson, , fumed: Tracksuits are fine for PE but not appropriate for a classroom. Whats wrong with wearing a unorm  Children should learn how to look smart and take a pride in their appearance. Unless were preparing for the next generation to be PE teachers or drug dealers then I think a traditional unorm is best.

I save up because Im a pensioner so when Ive got enough money I go and get one done. I like them so Ill get a few more but I wont have loads. I want a werewolf on my back and then Ill leave it for a little bit. Glenys got her first of tattoos - two hearts on her neck, a beauty spot on her face, two swallows on her hands and a devil and rose on her back - in .

But for the people watching at home, their presence might prompt memories of a more troubled time for the royal family. The Duke and Duchess of York , now both aged , tied the knot in  - but just six years later their marriage ended in scandal. Ferguson, more commonly known as Fergie, and Prince Andrew announced their separation in March . Five months later, the Duchess was embroiled in arguably the Royal familys biggest ever scandal when compromising photographs with her financial advisor, taken at her holiday villa in St Tropez, were published in the Daily Mirror.  The intimate pictures, shot with a telephoto lens as the couple lazed by the pool, show Texan millionaire John Bryan kissing and sucking the Duchess toes and the arch of her foot. They also showed the couple kissing and embracing, and frolicking in the pool. In one image, two-year-old Princess Eugenie watched on as Mr Bryan kissed her mother on the lips. Never before had a Royal been seen in this light.  On the morning the photographs were published, Sarah Ferguson was staying at Balmoral with the rest of the royal family. Royal writer Richard Kay claimed in the Daily Mail that he received a message via pager from Princess Diana the night before the photos hit the newspaper stands. Dianas message was simple: The redheads in trouble. He then got a call from John Bryan askinghe could obtain an early copy of the Mirror so he could see what was being said. Kay obliged, rushing to Bryans flat just as he received a call from a concerned Sarah Ferguson.  Bryan promised her everything would be fine, but I could see in his face that he didn’t really believe it, Kay wrote. In a few short hours, those pictures were going to be on the breakfast room sideboard in the Queen’s castle. They would also be winging around the world to be pored over by millions. But there was one thing in particular that annoyed Bryan as he surveyed the media coverage. According to Kay, he said: I wasn’t sucking her toes, I was kissing them! Fergie hastily left the Scottish holiday home in the morning and drove the  miles to Aberdeen airport with her children and nanny.  But when she eventually arrived at her Surrey house, there was more embarrassment for the Duchess as nobody was there to open the gates. Instead of shooting past the reporters and photographers lining up outside, she was forced to sit while a detective got out of the car to unlock the barrier. After four years of separation, Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew officially announced their decision to orce in May .  She has retained her title Duchess of York but ceased being a Royal Highness. Should Sarah marry again, she will also lose her Duchess title. Years after their split, Fergie claimed the marriage was troubled due to her husbands prolonged periods away from home. She explained: What I got was not the man, I got the palace and didnt get him. Sarah still attends s with daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie and in  was invited to stay at Balmoral as a guest of the Queen.

The storm strengthened to a Category  storm today as it moved towards the Florida Panhandle, where residents were ordered to get out of harms way ahead of le-threatening waves, winds and rains. Tens of thousands of people were told to evacuate the coastal areas in nine counties as the storm approached. Michael could grow to a Category  storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale before it makes landfall on Wednesday, potentially the most powerful storm to strike the Panhandle in at least a decade.  Florida Governor Rick Scott told ABCs Good Morning America that the effects of the storm would not be felt for another  hours and warned of the potential deadly impact of what could be a -footcoastal storm surge. Askedthere would be more evacuation orders, he said officials were monitoring the situation but that people in potentially affected areas should not take any chances against such a large storm surge. No ones going to survive such a wall of water, Scott said. Dont take a chance.  The storm was forecast to make landfall along a -milestretch of the Florida coast with Panama City at the centre, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Residents along more than  miles of coastline, from the Alabama Florida border to the Suwannee River in Florida, have been told to brace for hurricane conditions, forecasters said.  As much as one footof rain is also forecast across Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, the NHC reported. It warned that both could trigger deadly flooding, adding that residents within the hurricane warning zone should also prepare for le-threatening winds. Scott declared a state of emergency in  counties along the Panhandle and Floridas Big Bend regions. About , National Guard soldiers were assisting and more than , troops were placed on standby. We havent seen anything like this in the Panhandle for decades, Scott told ABC, adding that water could come miles inland.  State offices, schools and universities were closed through the end of the week in Panhandle counties. Lines at gas stations grew as people left. Those who stayed emptied grocery store shelves of water and other supplies. In neighboring Alabama, Governor Kay Ivey declared an emergency for the entire state on Monday, anticipating wind damage, heavy rains and power outages. Hurricane Michael would be the first major hurricane to hit the Panhandle since Hurricane Dennis in , which made landfall near Pensacola, according to hurricane center data. Torrential downpours and flash flooding over the weekend caused  deaths in Central America after Michael formed off the coast of northern Honduras.  After striking Florida, Michael is forecast to move up the East Coast on Wednesday and Thursday through the Carolinas, which are still recovering from Hurricane Florence.

The video reportedly captured on Sunday shows a white light moving from right to left before it speeds up and disappears. The uploader then replays the video in slow motion, which appears to give the white light a more triangular shape, asa shield has formed around it.  The video was picked up by UFO researcher Scott C. Waring who commented on his UFO sightings blog: This video was made by a UFO researcher in Australia watching the live Mexico City cam. He is famous for his hard work in the field and this time he caught an amazing Pyramid UFO that is semi cloaked moving through the clouds. I have heard of pyramid clouds, but very few legit reports come in like this one, his blog post continued. As you see the cam takes a photo every few seconds so there is a jump in-between, but the UFO is seen in many still shots.

The -storey Ponte City tower in Johannesburg, South Africa, looms over the city from the rough suburb of Berea. Soaring to m , the building has been used as a location for the sci-fi thriller District  and horror film Resident Evil. Architect Dimitar Karanikolov captured this series of sublime images in May after a trip to the country to photograph wildle. The -year-old, from London said: Ponte City tower is probably the most amazing and also terrying piece of dystopian architecture Ive ever seen.  Built in , the cylindrical skyscraper was intended to be a prime location in what, at the time, was an up-and-coming area of the nations largest urban centre. But a steep rise in crime in the s saw gangs move in, turning Ponte City into a vertical slum. As the building fell further into decay and disrepair, its hollow centre was reportedly filled with so much rubbish that it reached to the fth floor.  At one point, there were even proposals to turn it into a high-rise prison. Although the building has been renovated in recent years - with residents gradually ing - the area still has its problems. Dimitar said: We were told we should not go alone in this neighbourhood and especially this building as it is too dangerous. Even our taxi driver was surprised we wanted to get to this part of the town.  He eventually arranged to go with Dlala Nje, an organisation that works with children in the area and does guided tours of the tower. Dimitar said: I was sure it would be a very photogenic space and an exciting place to see. I specialise in architectural visualisation, which is more or less virtual photography. The same principles of composition, light and colour apply in my daytime job as in classic photography.  Images taken on his Leica Q with a mm lens show the circular floors ascending towards the blinding daylight from the darkness of its base. One vertigo-inducing picture taken from one of the upper floors makes the interior look like a bottomless well. Others show his guides posing on the unfinished rock of the ground floor, craning their necks upwards. Dimitar said: Ponte city is a photographers dream - a surreal space with great textures, light and context.

The heartstopping footage shows the plane coming into land, before it descends towards the runway and brushes past another parked plane. A child could be overheard screaming as the DC approached the runway in South America near Colombia’s border with Brazil. While some screamed in disbelief, one bystander could be heard whooping with joy at the devil-dare flyover instead of running for his le. Regional newspaper El Morichal posted the footage on a social media feed alongside the strapline: “Skill or recklessness ” Local reports said Civil Aviation authorities had launched an investigation into the incident at Taraira’s airstrip, where DC planes carrying cargo and passengers land three times a week from larger cities in Colombia and tractors are used to take passengers’ luggage from the hold.  Colombian daily El Pais described it as an “extraordinary manoeuvre which almost caused an air accident” Argentinian pilot Manuel Mazzucco, commenting on the footage, said: “It’s impossible for this pilot to calculate whether his landing gear is going to hit the plane below. “I’ve been flying for  years and spent the last ten working for an airline and my opinion is definitely that this is recklessness.” Colombian teacher Jose Ramirez Bedoya added: “The question is not one of whether it’s recklessness but the fact that this is not an airport with proper security and those planes are from the s.”  But Francisco Hurtado wrote: “The pilot can see there’s a plane at the top of the runway and even then he continues with his approach. “For me it’s skill but with a controlled amount of risk.” The town and airport of Taraira are just . miles west of Colombia’s border with Brazil. It is part of the department of Vaupes, which is in the jungle-covered Amazonas Region of the country. Its main economic activities are logging and fishing. The vast majority of the population consists of indigenous inhabitants. Princess Juliana Airport on the Caribbean island of St Maarten is famed among pilots who often have to fly close to holidaymakers packing Maho Beach to land.  Thrill-seekers have also been known to hold on to the fence of the airport when a jet is getting ready to take off so they are blasted when the engine kicks in, lting them off the ground. A sign next to the beach warns people they can be killed by the jet blast from landing planes. Lukla Airport in Nepal usually tops the list of the world’s most dangerous airports.

kid Roarie Deacon’scoincided with Dundee’s first league victory of the season – could he be the piece that’s been missing from their Premiership jigsaw The -year-old, who signed from English National League side Sutton United last summer, has missed the entire start of the season after having ankle surgery.Picking up the injury in the final game of last season, the enigmatic attacker ed for the final six minutes of the club’s first league win of the season – at the seventh time of the asking – at Hamilton and, in the process, set up the second goal.And hiswas hailed by manager Neil McCann.He said: “Roarie Deacon I am really pleased about getting back in because we have suffered some real injury problems of late.“He hadn’t featured at all, he’d only had  minutes of football all season before Saturday but I knew putting him on he could secure the ball because he is so strong.“You can’t get close to Roarie and he turned the boy beautully, then he had the composure.“I have to commend the other boys as well because they were still trying to get into the box at that stage to get the killer goal.”Deacon himself was delighted to be back in action after his y spell out.A process that was extended after an older injury reared its head once more.His debut season was also curtailed by injury with a troublesome thigh problem picked up in December at Hearts keeping him out of action for a big chunk of the middle of the campaign.And, on histo training this season, he hurt the same thigh once more.Deacon said: “I had ankle surgery the first week into pre-season.“I twisted it and damaged ankle ligaments in the game against Partick and through the summer it didn’t heal itself.“The surgeon didn’t want to operate initially but it didn’t heal itself so we made the decision to go under the kne to sort it out.“I was supposed to be back a little earlier than this but on the first session back I re-injured my thigh, a problem I had last season, so I needed a bit of intense rehabilitation on that to get back.“Now, though, I am ready to go and I’m fit.”With goals being a real issue for the side – just four scored in their seven league games and half of them against Accies at the weekend – Deacon’sis a timely boost for the Dark Blues.In fact, he’s only played around six minutes this season but has already had a hand in a quarter of their league goals.Coming into the side struggling for goals and points, though, hasn’t ruffled Deacon in any way.And Dundee fans will be hoping his direct running and ability to go past people is the key that unlocks defences with tough matches against Kilmarnock on Saturday and then Livingston, Hearts and Celtic in the next month.The former Sutton man admits he’s surprised the Dark Blues find themselves bottom of the table as he s to fitness and has backed them to get up the table,they keep doing what they’ve been doing.He added: “I am very surprised, everyone is surprised.“No way we thought we would come in, do well in pre-season, and then come in and after six games not have a point on the board.“However, after Hamilton everyone is positive, you can’t not be because the way we’ve been playing it’s not like we’ve not created chances or played well despite not getting points.“Everyone is buzzing about in training, raring to go and wanting to do well for Dundee.”"},{"url":null,"title":"local economy could get

stores from across the UK set to close.It is thought around  jobs in Inverness alone will be lost when it shuts by early . Job losses nationally are said to be in the region of  after Homebase entered into a company voluntary arrangement following \"under-performance of the business\".The applicant outlines that there is no demand for the store to be re-let as a single unit and iding the unit into two would help avoid the potential for a long-term vacancy.It is thought splitting the space would make it more appealing to potential tenants.Inverness economist Tony Mackay said: \"If iding the unit into two makes it more attractive then that is a good move to make.\"I believe one of the occupiers is likely to be another DIY store but I do not know what the other store would be.\"The main problem for the retail park has been the increase in online shopping. This has been the same problem for retailers in the city centre.\"In light of a \"city first policy\" which encourages businesses to establish themselves in the city centre rather than out-of-town locations, Mr Mackay does not believe this will give the retail park an unfair advantage over more central stores.He said: \"More needs to be done about the problem of online shopping on retailers. For a store like Homebase people were likely to drive there to get whatever they needed.\"The applicant suggested that despite the \"centre first\" policy this move would not be a problem because no new floor space is being created.The existing floor space would simply be split into two separate retail units.Mr Mackay said: \"It is not the type of store you would be likely to find in the city centre. I would be surprisedthe council were to reject this application.\"Mike Smith, manager of the Inverness Business Improvement District , does not support the proposal.\"In my personal opinion I do not think the plan should go ahead,\" he said.\"One of the restrictions of the retail park was that there were only to be single units in section  of the Town and Country Planning Act. To ide the unit into two is going against what has already been established.\"This is my opinion within my role as manager and not that of Bid.

Despite suffering the dislocated shoulder the teen was still able to talk to the Evening Express immediately after his memorable first start.He said: “It is the first time I have done my shoulder.“It popped out when I went down. It wasn’t nice and was pretty sore.“I was just lying there on the pitch and thankfully it popped back in itself when I stood up so hopefully it is not too bad. I can move about so hopefully I will be okay as we have the international break coming up.”McLennan made his Dons debut in a - away defeat to St Johnstone in April  when coming off the bench late on.He featured as a substitute in the - Betfred Cup defeat of St Mirren last month. That was the only game time for the Reds until his start at the weekend.Now that he has made that breakthrough the teen is determined to fight to retain his spot in McInnes’ starting line-up.He said: “This is a massive club with massive players so there is competition day in, day out.“There is so much talent and depth in the squad but hopefullyI get the chance again I will go on and take it.”McLennan underlined his potential by netting a sublime solo goal in the - Scottish Youth Cup final defeat to Hibs at Hampden last season when he beat three challenges to score.Confirmation of his first start came just hours before the St Mirren game when strikers James Wilson and Stevie May were both ruled out late on by injury.McLennan said: “I only found out before the game that I was going to start so there wasn’t time to get nervous.“I turned  on the day before the game – I’m feeling old now.“For my goal the ball came through and I thought I would just hit it. I didn’t really see the ball go in to be honest as the defender was blocking me.“The main thing was to get three points and get ourselves back up the league table.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

It means the state-of-the-art school is well on track for opening its doors to pupils and staff in October . Built in the grounds of the existing academy, the new school is keenly anticipated as it’s set to not only transform learning and teaching, but will also signicantly enhance facilities for the local community. The new building will have space for up to  young people, with modern classrooms, massive games hall, two all-weather pitches, games courts and a host of other exciting facilities which are sure to impress pupils, staff and the wider public. Kier Construction is building the school, which is being delivered by South Ayrshire Council in partnership with hub South West. The project is part of a poundmillion programme of works delivered across South Ayrshire with the aim of boosting education standards through targeted investment in schools and communities. Councillor Peter Henderson, the council’s resources and performance portfolio holder, said: “Our new, extended and refurbished schools are completely transforming learning across South Ayrshire and the new Queen Margaret Academy is shaping up to do more of the same. We’re committed to creating modern learning environments that not only inspire children and young people, but provide an important hub and network for the local community. “We want those attending our schools to achieve their full potential when they move on from school and our focus on providing the best education possible, with the best facilities, means we are on our way to achieving this ambition. “Our schools always play a key role in local le so we’re ensuring that their excellent sports facilities can be accessed by the wider public. We also ensure there are areas of our schools that can be used by community groups and the new Queen Margaret Academy will be no dferent.” Michael McBrearty, chief executive of delivery partner, hub South West Scotland, said: “The new school will be a fantastic contemporary and innovative learning environment that will create an abundance of opportunities and benefits to the entire community.” Brian McQuade, managing director of Kier Construction Scotland  north-east England, said: “Up to  people have been on site during peak periods of activity and to date we have created one apprenticeship, seven work placements and three student summer intern placements. This has provided young local talent the opportunity to gain valuable experience working on a state-of-the-art building and a unique insight into the built environment and the erse range of roles available.” Oonagh Browne headteacher at Queen Margaret Academy said: “It’s exciting to see our new school taking shape. Parents, young people and staff were crucial in planning the facilities for our new school, so it’s very much their project and this only increases their anticipation”. The Bishop of Galloway, Right Reverend William Nolan said: “While the ground works were taking place little seemed to be happening on site but in recent months the structure of the building has sprung up, giving a sense of excitement and anticipation as we look forward to the completion next year of a centre of learning that will inspire our young people.” When the new school opens, the old building will be demolished and the site fully landscaped.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"60k christmas lights up grabs","story":"Alexandra McCready switches on the lights with the help of the cast of the Ayr Gaiety pantomime Cinderella.\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pound, Christmas lights fund is up for grabs in villages and towns needing an illumination boost. But where the cash goes will be decided by South Ayrshire council officials depending on the needs of dferent areas. The move was approved at the full council meeting last week after a heated clash between rival councillors. Councillor Hugh Hunter put forward a motion for pound, cash to be distributed with a maximum of pound going to each town and pound for villages. He said communities faced a major challenge to raise money for lights. He said the council’s “huge” underspend should be used to pay for the festive displays. But his seasonal gesture was snubbed by ruling councillors who backed an amendment from Councillor Alec Clark to make pound, available instead. Independent Councillor Clark said: “We will try and bring some joy into people’s lives.” His amendment said: “With this fund it is important that the funding does not supplant or compete with the work that has been taking place over a number of years.” Conservative Councillor Hunter questioned how communities were supposed to apply for the cash but was told there wouldn’t be an application process. Labour Councillor Brian McGinley said: “There has been an issue with Christmas lights over a number of years.” He added: “We don’t want to undo the good work already going on in the community.” Responding to probes from the conservative opposition, he said: “We will talk to people about the current arrangements and do what we can.” Councillor Hunter said: “I can’t support the amendment. I ask councillors to support the clear motion.” Speaking after the meeting, Councillor Hunter said: “It wasn’t clear how communities could access it. It is really foggy and disappointing that we couldn’t get to the bottom of it.” Councillor Bob Pollock said he is concerned “some areas may miss out.” He said there was “no coherent explanation” on how the money would be “decided or managed” with only six weeks left until switch on. In a press release Councillor McGinley said: “We obviously have a finite amount of resources, so we know that we won’t be able to do everything that communities want right away, but it’s a terric starting point that will support people and places right across South Ayrshire at this special time of year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilChristmasAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayr seafront street cordoned following","story":"NewsAyr seafront street cordoned off following major police presenceIt is believed a man is attempting to jump off a roof on Queen Terrace in Ayr.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsQueens Terrace\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA young man threatened to jump -feet to the pavement in an astonishing roof-top stand-off in a street full of guest houses.

Arnold Clark took the decision to shut the twin showrooms and workshops in the town’s Lochside. The big transporters moved in to clear the stock and the famous yellow signage was quickly taken down. The old premises in Galloway Avenue sold cars for generations and was probably best known as the home of Robert McCall Fiat and Alfa Romeo. But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road. Arnold Clark also runs separate Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises in the town as well as a car and van hire centre. A long-time customer in Galloway Avenue said: “It is a real shame, but I guess dealerships want to be on busy roads in more modern buildings. Sadly Galloway Avenue would have needed a lot of investment and a member of staff said it simply was not in the right location any more. “Staff think the site could be flattened or put to another vehicle use.” Arnold Clark was unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsMotoring NewsAlfa RomeoFiatJaguarJeepPeugeotFishingPrestwickGalloway"},{"url":null,"title":"gymnastics club tries takeover council","story":"NewsGymnastics club tries to takeover council activity centre in TroonMuirhead Activity Centre is the target of Dundonald Gymnastics ClubShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA plan by a gymnastics club to take over Muirhead Activity Centre has met hostility. Secret talks have been taking place since the summer but have only just surfaced. Dundonald Gymnastics Club is ready to take control and turn the popular sports hall into a specialist centre. It would mean no more sports lets of the main hall for football, badminton and handball, the squash court would shut and the property would be shted from South Ayrshire Council ownership. Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association fired the first warning shot over the takeover. Chairman Frances Carson said: “The answer is no. If the council have pulled a fly one over this then they will never hear the end of it from this community.” Scott Telford, head coach of the gymnastics club, promised this week he will speak to the community about his ambitious plans. But Tory councillor Peter Convery slammed the secrecy, saying: “This came out of the blue to all the councillors and community and is an utter disgrace. “People at a meeting on Friday night were flabbergasted the hall could be taken out of council ownership. “The acid on the cake is the council has been speaking to the group without anyone knowing. “The council should not be treating its citizens this way.” Scott Telford said he has a full business plan for the centre and believes it can work. The club has  members and a waiting list of  more. He said the club have restricted facilities at their present base Dundonald Activity Centre, where five adults spend hours setting out and dismantling equipment. As a result they cannot develop youngsters to elite performance level and lose talented performers at an early age. Former top gymnast Scott, who lives in Muirhead, said: “The community will still get use of the centre for things like meetings and birthday parties and we would look to develop that. “There will also be the chance for the community to take part in gymnastics. “I appreciate people don’t like change but we can make this work. We could even look at parkour gymnastic sessions with teenagers on Friday night. “There is also a lot of outdoor space which we could change for other activities, depending on what the community want.” The dad first started helping at Dundonald when there were only  kids and ten mats. He added: “At the moment we get about  inquiries a week and just cannot cope. “I want to work with the Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association and want to hear all views. “We will be running a seven-day-a-week facility but it has to be financially sustainable and work with the community.” Councillor Craig Mackay said he wants full transparency when consultation starts. He said: “The onus will be on the gymnastics club to demonstrate the wider support of the community. “I am relaxed about the process and will very much wish to take on board the community’s views on this once we know the details of what is proposed. “I am concerned about how any potential transfer would impact on the use of the centre by the wide range of groups who currently use it. “The centre currently runs at a small but manageable loss and in my view any decision must be made on what is best for the community and not on the very minimal cost savings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsGymnasticsSouth Ayrshire CouncilBadmintonTroonDundonald"},{"url":null,"title":"shops replace homes new ayr","story":"NewsShops to replace homes in new Ayr town centre regeneration plansPeople to have their say on radical proposalsShareBySarah Hilley:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShops are to be replaced with homes in Ayr town centreradical new plans get the go-ahead. Proposals also include the High Street being coated with a new easy clean surface and bins being kept out of site. A great shop clearance has been proposed to regenerate the ailing shopping strip. South Ayrshire Council wants empty retail units to become homes at the bottom of the town. Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Internet shopping has signicantly altered the landscape in the town. “We need people back staying in the towns.” SNP Councillor Campbell took to his feet at week’s full council meeting to talk through the complete overhaul of the town centre. Conservative Councillor Ian Davis askedshop owners would be consultedthey are forced to move. He said: “This could mean some businesses will have to move. I want reassurances for businesses thatan area is to be reused for a dferent purpose that they are well consulted.” The meeting heard businesses would be consulted. The cleared Riverside block, which included Woolworths, would become a public square. The original proposal for a huge office block has been shelved. Commenting on the cleared site, Councillor Campbell said: “None of us expected the vista.” But he conceded how homes of some description could be erected on the site. He said: “Some sort of building on the site will be necessary.” A report submitted to council said: “There will also be the potential for a small number of residential units on the Riverside sitethis proves desirable through the public consultation exercise.” Council staff from soon-to-be demolished Burns House are likely to move into the Clydesdale Bank Building, the Town Hall and County Buildings instead. The Citadel is to be replaced with a brand new state-of-the art leisure centre on the High Street. A new streetscape surface could also be on the way. Councillor Campbell said: “If we are going to revamp the High Street we need to do it in a signicant way to keep it tidy. “During the main shopping times all the bins should be off the street.

Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September . The practice is optimistic that works will commence in early Januaryplanning permission is granted.” In other NHS news, it is understood community midwives have had to change their base from the Barassie Street clinic to Prestwick. One source said: “All that is left at Barassie Street seems to be podiatry. “The community nurses have to start their sht in Prestwick before coming to Troon for their first appointment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonNHS ScotlandAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"melrose-group-welcomes-post-office-plans","story":"MEMBERS of Melrose community council have welcomed plans to move the townrsquos post office to Market Square.As previously reported, the Post Office hopes to relocate the branch to Masons of Melrose bookshop.The townrsquos postmaster, John Collins, was hoping to retire at the end of last year.But he was forced to put his leaving plans on hold after proposals to move the provision to Abbey Mill in Annay Road were abandoned ndash following objections from the local community.William Windram, chairman of Melrose and District Community Council said: ldquoIrsquom sure everyone will have now seen there are plans to move the post office to Masons of Melrose.ldquoI havenrsquot yet heard anyone say they think the move is a bad idea.

phone calls from concerned constituents about the recent building work in Bowmore.It has seen a footpath being built over one side of Bowmore#s rugby pitch.I had a meeting with the Islay rugby team and heard directly about their concerns.I have also contacted Argyll and Bute Council#s planning department numerous times, and, on September , I spoke with James Macintyre of Macleod Construction and made my views very clear on this matter.The potential new G pitch and footpath are much needed and more than welcome.That said there have clearly been large failings in the consultation process and this must not happen in future.In order to find the best way forward MacLeods will need to move rugby posts to new positions, using new sleeves and with an Islay Rugby presence during the operation.Leveling off of the west side of the pitch must be carried out using good soil with a view to extending the level pitch by several meters.Material for a ryelock fence should be provided by MacLeods and or others, and permissions given for construction of a standard fence.This fence should run between the timber fence at the rear of the housing estate and the timber fence at the car park, in a line running along the pitch side edge of the new path across the rugby pitch.This should make the extended area as near dog-free as possible and solve the serious fouling problem which unfortunately continues to exist.Regardless of how many of my fellow Ileachs feel, about where this pathway has been built and the lack of proper communication, the hard working front line workers, of Macleods are only following orders and any hostility directed towards them is unhelpful and unfair.If these changes and additions to the building works are made all parties will be happy and Islay will have a terric rugby pitch.Bowmore locals will have a new foot path and Islay can hopefully look forward to the prospect of a wonderful new G pitch in the future.Despite the upset caused by this

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere.

Nicola Sturgeon said on Sunday that support for independence was at historically high levels, but in early September  a YouGov poll showed support for yes at  per cent this weekendrsquos survey for The Sunday Times on the other hand shows that, even with a no-deal Brexit, support for independence would be lower than that, at  per cent. ldquoHistorically pretty much the same might be a better description.However, itrsquos worth taking a look again at exactly what the new polls say. The first one, by Survation, found that,there were an independence referendum tomorrow,  per cent would vote yes and  per cent no. Butthe UK leaves the EU as planned next year, that changes to  for yes and  for no ndash and it changes againtherersquos a no-deal, with  per cent backing yes and  per cent no. The other survey, by Panelbase, found a similar rise:the UK left the EU without a deal, support for independence would increase from  per cent in  to  per cent, while support for the Union would fall from  to .On the face of it, these look like encouraging figures for the SNP, with Brexit pushing support for independence in the right direction. ButI were a Scottish Government strategist, I might privately be a bit worried. In fact, I might even have suggested to my bosses that they keep quiet about the Survation poll, which was commissioned by the SNP, for the simple reason that it doesnrsquot show enough of what they need it to show.The problem is that the surveys do indeed appear to indicate support for the SNP and independence going up. But they also demonstrate something more disturbing for the party, which is that the expected Brexit effect on support for independence simply isnrsquot happening, or at least it isnrsquot happening to the extent that Nicola Sturgeon needs it to.This lack of a signicant Brexit bounce also emphasises the dilemmas faced by Ms Sturgeon. The party members who traipsed into the conference on Sunday and marched through Edinburgh on Saturday are nationalists because their heart tells them to be, but the First Minister takes a much more mathematical approach to the situation, led by the numbers and the probabilities.This is why we saw her shting her position on a second EU referendum at the weekend. The dficulty for Ms Sturgeon is that shersquos a declared supporter of the EU, but the very thing she appears to be fighting ndash Brexit ndash may also offer her the best chance of getting what she really wants: Scottish independence. This means she has to be careful not to fight Brexit too hard, and yet she can see that a consensus is building for a second EU referendum that it would look odd for the SNP to oppose. And so Sturgeon the mathematician nudges forward and says her MPs would support it in the Commons. Their leader there, Ian Blackford, gave the game away when he addressed the subject. ldquoWe will not obstruct a second vote on Brexit, he said ndash hardly the words of a passionate anti-Brexiteer.The weekendrsquos opinion polls throw up similar strategical problems on when to hold a second independence referendum. They do appear to show a small Brexit effect and, anecdotally, Irsquove noticed it among friends and family. Quite a few who voted no in  have told me, over a coffee , that Brexit means they might vote dferently next time. But a hypothetical vote in the pub, or indeed in an opinion poll, is not the same as the real thing, when all the old economic realities would come back. Indeed, they might be even more intense in a post-Brexit world with switherers asking themselves whether, having come out of one economic union , they want to risk coming out of another .The fact that the small rise in support for independence is based on these hypotheticals leaves Nicola Sturgeon with three equally risky options. The first is to call a referendum before the next Scottish elections in  but that would be rejected by Theresa May and probably even Jeremy Corbynhe were PM given the pressure he would face from his Scottish wing. The SNP might be able to gain some traction by fostering a grievance about the referendum being rejected in this way, but option one is essentially a dead end.The second option is one that no one expects to happen ndash a Catalan-style, unofficial referendum ndash but itrsquos the third ndash delay the referendum until after  - that is the most likely. The theory behind it, as far as some SNP strategists are concerned, is that this allows more time for Brexit to convert more no voters. The aim would also be to win the  election based on a promise to hold another independence referendum, which would make it impossible for a Prime Minister to say no.This is Nicola Sturgeonrsquos preferred option ndash she just hasnrsquot said it yet. Indeed, itrsquos never going to be easy for her to say it as long as thousands of nationalists are marching through Scottish cities. She also knows that delaying is risky ndash the Panelbase poll predicts that the independence-supporting parties will lose their majority in  there is also a danger that voters will simply get used to being outside the EU Brexit will become the new status quo.And then therersquos the awkward reality that, whatever your analysis of the new polls, there is still a working majority in Scotland opposed to independence. Ms Sturgeonrsquos gamble ndash as yet undeclared ndash is that this will change by . The problem is that, even in the face of a Tory-imposed Brexit, both sides in Scotlandlook pretty resistant to change."},{"url":null,"title":"lovely-jubbly-musical-version-of-only-fools-and-horses-created","story":"The creator of the long-running sitcom died aged  in , before work on a musical retelling of the Trotters misadventures could be completed.His son Jim has partnered with comedy writer Paul Whitehouse to pen Only Fools And Horses The Musical and fulfil his fathers wishes for a stage production.The show took five years to complete and features an original score which includes contributions from Hodges, who died in September.Whitehouse told the Press Association the feel-good stage show aims to protect the legacy of the BBC series, which first aired in .He said: \"It was John Sullivans project, and it was what he was writing when he very tragically died.\"I spoke with Chas Hodges about doing some stuff with this.

On top of that, most of the additional cases in Scotland are equal pay and we are right down the middle of that - rooting out discrimination.\"The rise in equal pay cases is particularly appropriate since it was equal pay in Dumfries  Galloway that the Supreme Court used as an example of how free access to justice for one worker seeking pay equality brings benefit for many thousands.\"The judges were right in their analysis back in  and this data shows how big landmark cases reverberate in workplaces across the entire country.\"When the fees were introduced in July , The Herald reported a drop in cases of almost  per cent year on year.This prompted claims from employment experts that thousands of workers, especially women, who had been unfairly sacked or discriminated against, were being denied access to justice.The current figures from the UK Government show a complete turnaround, with equal pay cases - including a large scale claim against Glasgow City Council - accounting for the bulk of the cases with an increase of  per cent.Unfair dismissal claims also increased by  per cent over the period, while sex discrimination claims went up by almost  per cent and disability discrimination claims almost doubled.Brian McLaughlin, an employment lawyer with Unionline Scotland, which represents members of the GMB and Communications Workers Union, said: \"This is a signicant increase which is obviously welcomed by Unionline Scotland and the GMB and CWU trade unions.\"These fees were a barrier to justice which created a signicant problem for unfairly treated employees for the best part of four years.\"This upsurge in cases shows that the fees were a clear denial of access to justice.\"Jim Stephenson, convener of the Law Society of Scotlandrsquos Access to Justice committee, added that the increase showed \"a very real need for an accessible, impartial system to resolve workplace disputes\".While David Martyn, an employment specialist with Thompsons solicitors, claimed that the fees proved to be a \"massive disincentive\" for workers.\"For someone who was only claiming say pound, and having to pay out pound in upfront fees, the risk to reward ratio really didnt make any economic sense,\" he said.He also claimed that the scrapping of the fees has had a \"signicant impact\" on the employment tribunal service in Scotland, which he described as \"stretched\".A total of  new judges have been appointed in Scotland to meet the increased demand for hearings, while several tribunal rooms at the main hearing centre in Glasgow, which were converted into office space while the fee regime was in place, have had to be reinstated.Mr Martyn said: \"The tribunal service is struggling to cope, it was almost inevitable when the fees were stopped. The staff are doing their very best but theyre certainly stretched.\"These concerns were echoed by employment specialist Stephen Miller, of Clyde  Co, who claimed the tribunal service \"has been overwhelmed by the numbers\".He added that the increase in claims would also result in businesses and organisations facing signicant costs in defending the actions."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-councils-invest-20m-to-modernise-library-service","story":"The Scottish Library and Information Councilsaid the investment showed the strong commitment of councils to public library services.Earlier this month, figures showed a dramatic increase in the number of libraries being shut - with  closed in the past two years alone.However, the latest figures show council investment has led to the building or refurbishment of  libraries since March last year.Additional funding has also been provided to modernise library services with the introduction of free public wi, D printing resources and a film education programme.Fiona Hyslop, Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, welcomed the investment - announced in Libraries Week.She said: ldquoThis week celebrates the vital role of our libraries in Scotland and the fantastic service provided by staff and volunteers.ldquoI welcome this yearrsquos focus on wellbeing, which fits in well with the Scottish Governmentrsquos commitment to promoting social wellbeing and tackling social isolation and inequality through increased access to library services.ldquoSince , we have invested more than pound million to help re-invigorate the role of public libraries, providing funds to support local and national activity.ldquoI encourage local communities throughout Scotland to continue to use and benefit from the wide range of services that our local libraries provide.Pamela Tulloch, chief executive of SLIC, said a national libraries strategy had provided a framework for the ldquotransformation of services in the st century.She said: ldquoIn some areas, this has led to some venue closures to make way for a more relevant and flexible model of delivery.ldquoHowever, local government has continued to invest in the estate, demonstrated by the signicant capital spend.ldquoPublic libraries have faced a challenging time in recent years amidst public spending cuts.ldquoHowever, they have shown tremendous resilience and are adapting services to meet the needs of modern users.The latest figures show there is still a strong commitment to public libraries from the public with premise and virtual visits increasing from .m to over m since .Earlier this month, there was concern that the service was under threat with figures showing  libraries have been closed in the past two years.Figures form SLIC showed said  libraries closed last year, up from  the previous year.Closures have remained in single figures for most of the previous decade.There are fears libraries are seen as a ldquosoft touch for councils looking to make cuts in a climate of falling budgets.The former Scots-based Gruffalo author Julia Donaldson hit out at the scale of the closures, saying libraries served a vital role as community centres.A spokesman for the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals in Scotland said: ldquoWe recognise that recent years have seen huge local authority budgetary cuts.ldquoThe fact the number of people using libraries has increased in the same period highlights their popularity, the changing ways people access services and the vital contribution they make to community cohesion, social and economic wellbeing, digital skills, literacy and more.ldquoWe urge local authorities to think very carefully and consult residents fully before closing any libraries."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-let-us-stand-together-against-the-scourge-of-toxic-masculinity","story":"Thatrsquos not to say no woman has ever committed a violent or sexual offence ndash an infinitesimally small proportion of women have ndash but to compare such offences by women to offences by men, is to weigh a gnat against a mammoth.Irsquom not even going to rehearse the lsquonot all menrsquo argument ndash that lsquonot all menrsquo are abusive or predatory. I detest those three malignant words ndash they are a great wall standing in the way of men confronting the problems of their sex. Those words prevent our betterment as men.

Caitie, a university student, ran to her place of work, Silverburn shopping centre in Glasgow, and rang the police. The offender had mental health problems and police would not interview him. As a result, he was never charged or prosecuted. To compound her anguish, the man stalked her at work.

But I was astonished. Hundreds of women contacted me through social media or by email to offer their love and support to my daughter, many said they empathised with her because the same, or worse, had happened to them. These were women Irsquove never met, that I do not know ndash they had no reason to share their suffering with me, a man.

Some women spoke of being victims of sexual offences but keeping silent because they believed the police would not help them, due to the experiences of friends and family. A woman even said that a police officer asked her for oral sex and then told her he knew where she lived. A psychologist said they had heard many stories of police failings by victims of sex crimes.One terrible story was of a disabled woman being sexually assaulted and the case quickly closed. In one of the most distressing stories, a woman reported being sexually assaulted by a man in a town street while police watched, and did nothing. One mother told of police humiliating her teenage daughter during an interview after she was the victim of an offence ndash in the end there was no prosecution either.The dreadful truth, though, is that none of this is new. It wasnrsquot new last year when a predatory president walked into the Oval Office with a string of sexual assault claims hanging around his neck, and it wasnrsquot new millennia ago either.

The reason, Sir Howard is reported as saying, is that as the bank has staged ldquoone of the biggest corporate turnarounds in history it is now ldquofully focused on building a much better bank for our customers.It is not the first time that the bank has tried to distance itself from the RBS moniker, with a  decision seeing it drop the name from  branches across the UK in favour of Royal Bank of Scotland north of the Border and NatWest south of it. The plan now is to stop using it in a corporate context, which essentially means when trying to find institutions interested in buying its shares.The thing is, RBS has come a long way in the past  years. Having grown into an unwieldy international behemoth under the leadership of former boss Fred ldquothe shred Goodwin, the business has slimmed down into something far more recognisable as a mainstream British bank. It has also taken some steps to right past wrongdoings by paying compensation to certain shareholders and customers who were affected by its actions.Signs that RBS was finally starting to emerge from the wilderness came earlier this year when the institution made a profit then paid a idend for the first time in a decade. When, in August, it agreed to pay pound. billion to settle a US Department of Justice investigation that had hung over it for the same period of time, RBS was able finally to draw a faint line under its past misdemeanours.To rebrand now, just when City analysts think the bank is starting to look investable again, would seem almost as wacky as taking part in the poundbn take-over of a Dutch bank on which limited due diligence had been done. Indeed, while RBS may have been well advised to reinvent itself in the immediate aftermath of its bailout, it would seem there is no pressing need for it to do so now.Sure RBS continues to be dogged by problems, as evidenced by it being labelled Britainrsquos worst bank for customer service by the Competition and Markets Authority and the worst for handling PPI claims by consumer group Which .Its decision to plough ahead with branch closures in the face of a signicant public backlash has also done its reputation no favours, with the fact that other banks are doing exactly the same thing having no truck with a public that feels it has a vested interest in RBS thanks to the Treasury retaining a signicant shareholding in it.But these issues are small fry compared to what RBS has been through over the past  years, and as it is facing them from a position of relative corporate strength they are hardly worth reinventing itself for now. As brand expert Marc Cloosterman wrote in US publication Branding Strategy Insider in June, a business with a bad reputation may use a rebranding exercise to ldquoameliorate or dispel negative associationsthat reputation is ldquohaving a serious impact on its operating results.But with RBS seemingly well on the road to recovery the pressure on its brand has eased and, with investors liking nothing better than a company that is clearly on the up, surely it is only a matter of time before its brand is rehabilitated too.That it is given the chance to do this is important not just for the bank but for Scotland as well. Like brand identity, national identity is a tricky concept to pin down, but it essentially revolves around how disparate groups of people use symbols and ideas to bind themselves to one another in an image of togetherness.Being measured in our financial dealings has long been seen as an essential part of what it is to be Scottish, with the way we behave as iniduals shaping our institutions and informing the way we are viewed by others. It is fair to say that RBS has been a huge embarrassment to Scotland, and rightly so, but that is because the country helped shape the bankrsquos reputation for canniness in the first place.Planning to get rid of the RBS brand may be more about a bank that is now run from London wanting to distance itself from the nation whose image it helped to tarnish. But to obliterate a name we were once so proud of just when the institution behind it is starting to emerge as something better would be to do a disservice to all of us."},{"url":null,"title":"david-versus-goliath-in-cleantech-how-small-countries-spark-big-scale-climate-innovations","story":"Competitive advantage for smaller countriesSmaller countries may feel left behind in the race for cleantech patents, economic success and global climate impact. But in fact, these countries may have the perfect competitive advantage. Scotland, for example, is one of the worldrsquos most climate-ambitious countries. It set itself world-leading climate and renewable energy targets and has low carbon industries worth pound billion a year at the last analysis. And it managed to beat its  climate targets six years early.ldquoSmall nations have the opportunity to take what works and replicate it on a large scale by collaborating across sectors to unlock the barriers to a thriving zero carbon future, says Ed Craig, Deputy Director of the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Innovationand Climate-KIC lead for Scotland.With a population just shy of . million, Scotland as a whole has fewer people than big name cities like London or New York. Scotlandrsquos cities ndash such as Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee ndash are, like most cities around the world, more compact. This makes them ideal as engines of change to drive transformation in the places we live.Edinburgh, for example, has no shortage of opportunities to put low carbon solutions into practice. The Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal will see pound million of public money invested in data-driven innovation over the next  years. ECCI is working to focus this on low carbon mobility and smart city innovation, with new developments on Edinburghrsquos waterfront providing an ideal test bed for radical new approaches.Scotlandrsquos goals and legal frameworkThe UK and Scottish Climate Change Acts set world leading legislation to mandate steep emissions reductions and develop effective risk management strategies for climate change. The Climate Change Act  commits the UK government by law to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least % of  levels by . Scotlandrsquos  Climate Change Act includes an emissions target, set for the year , for a reduction of at least % from .In January , the Scottish Government outlined plans to meet its target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by  per cent on  levels by . These plans come after Scotland beat its  climate targets six years early.The Scottish Energy Strategy, published in December , sets out plans for half of Scotlandrsquos heat, transport and electricity needs to be met using renewables by , and for Scotland to phase out new petrol and diesel cars and vans by .All this was translated into legal frameworks requiring public and private sector organisations to manage their emissions, explore new sources of energy and manage climate risk.The role of the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Innovation These developments challenged the Scottish university sector to deliver issue-orientated rather than discipline-orientated research. To ensure their research was relevant to and had impact in the real world partnerships were needed with business and government to deliver solutions at scale. This is where ECCI comes in.ECCI was established in  to take the lead in this emerging space and trigger the collaborative action needed to deliver on Scotlandrsquos climate ambitions. Itrsquos the leading low carbon hub for Scotland and beyond, driving cross-sector collaboration and effective action for a zero carbon world. It joins forces with leading national and international organisations working at the cutting edge of public policy, business and research to drive action.ECCIrsquos Ed Craig: ldquoScotlandrsquos ecosystem brings together the legal framework, expertise and entrepreneurial spark to drive change on a massive scale. Creating thriving low carbon cities isnrsquot just about curbing climate change. Itrsquos the best way to create vibrant and liveable places with strong economic growth.The centre will draw on its role delivering projects, policy expertise and business support for a zero carbon future. This includes its role co-leading ClimateXChange ndash Scotlandrsquos centre of expertise on climate change ndash and delivering the Sustainable Scotland Network of sustainability professionals.Cities cluster together the people, ideas and resources to make low carbon solutions a reality. They are our best chance of creating change on the scale needed. So ECCI is working on several projects, funded by its partner Climate-KIC, to harness citiesrsquo power as wider engines of change.Ed Craig explains: ldquoScotlandrsquos world-leading record on climate action is backed by a thriving cleantech sector forging new ground in areas from data to smart mobility.Small country leading by exampleThe numbers are impressive. Low carbon industries in Scotland generated pound billion in turnover and supported , jobs in  www.wired-gov.net. This accounts for .% of the total UK turnover, and .% of the total employment, in the sector ndash both higher than Scotlandrsquos share of the population.Paul Wheelhouse, Minister for Energy, Connectivity and the Islands: ldquoThesefigures underline both the huge opportunity that decarbonising our energy system presents, as well as the critical importance of continuing to support the sector properly ndash encouraging investment, generating value, and creating jobs across Scotland.The global conversation on fixing climate change hosted by ECCI.

I am grateful to Andy Moir once again for making himself available and to all those we met in Stronsay, who engaged constructively and put forward a number of issues for further consideration.“The key issue raised at the public meeting was undoubtedly the decision by NHS Orkney not to include a helipad on the site of the new Balfour hospital. Concerns were expressed about apparent delays in transferring Isles patients, brought in by air ambulance, from Kirkwall airport to the current Balfour due to a lack of land ambulance capacity.“While it is unlikely that NHS Orkney will reopen the decision on a helipad, ious suggestions were made about how delays in transfer to the hospital might be avoided in future. Mr Moir agreed to take these up with his colleagues responsible for land ambulance provision. Hopefully this may enable greater resilience to be built into the service going forward.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This includes travel costs to attend training or to compete on the Scottish mainland, which he believes can be prohibitive.#Grants and sponsorship are available and invaluable, but finding ways to reduce costs remains a challenge,# he explained.“I was also told that for some girls and women, the macho image associated with certain sports can be a disincentive to get involved. In that respect, having good female role models is important and in Orkney we are fortunate to have a great many.#The success of Anna Tait and Rachael Sutherland at the last two Orkney Sportsperson of the Year Awards illustrates this perfectly, with Anna winning from an all-female shortlist that also included Sarah MacPhail and Hannah Beavan, and Amy Golder taking the top junior award. Meanwhile, Orkney Dragons go from strength to strength, attracting more girls and women into playing rugby.Increasing participation is something that Mr McArthur feels we should all be able to support.#Role models are part of that, but we need to look at ways of removing obstacles, whether that be to do with funding, facilities or even, as Anna Tait suggested, making the image of a sportswoman more acceptable to young girls.“When you see those inspirational people within your own community, it’s so much easier to say ‘well why not me #copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The other sites being considered for the initial roll-out include Glasgow, Ayr, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Fort William, Milngavie, Oban, Inverness and Aberdeen.The units will be fitted with technology that will enable them to digitally track water usage at each Top-up point, transmitting the data via cloud technology to specialists managing Scotland’s water networks. The resulting data will be used to calculate cost and plastic savings, along with the volume of water being consumed.Douglas Millican, Scottish Water chief executive, said: “Our research shows that people feel very positively towards the quality of Scotland’s tap water — now these state-of-the-art taps can provide access to enable water drinkers to enjoy it while on the go by carrying and using refillable bottles.”The Your Water, Your Le campaign aims to make tap the first choice for water drinkers wherever they are, and encourages businesses to make it readily available for staff and customers. Zero Waste Scotland, Keep Scotland Beautul and Scottish Natural Heritage, have also voiced their support.On average, a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap, could save £. a day, nearly £ a year.For further information, visit yourwateryourle vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She called for the creation of prearranged collections for businesses seeking to deposit large amounts of cash, after the review recognised that such arrangements could be improved.The MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch said: \"As the MSP for Beauly and Kyle, I am of course disappointed that the RBS branches in both towns are to close.\"While I recognise branch use has been declining in both of these areas, there are still well-documented and legitimate questions regarding security and disabled access in the alternative banking provision.\"The review plainly states that the branch closure in Beauly will cause dficulties for vulnerable customers and so as the constituency MSP I am calling on RBS to work with me to put measures in place to provide specic support for them. I hope RBS will work with me to listen to the views of the community council to ensure there are better routes and provision in the Beauly area.\"The union Unite slated the announcement by RBS, arguing that the bank had simply gone through the motions of reviewing the cases before pushing ahead with its original plans.The unionrsquos regional officer, Lyn Turner, said: \"The Johnston Carmichael review was entirely predictable and nothing but a rubber-stamp of RBS management decisions. Sixty communities out of an original  with branches earmarked for closure will now be marginalised by this so-called review. Unite will request to meet RBS urgently to discuss the impact.\"Simon Watson, managing director of personal banking at RBS pledged to provide banking alternatives in Kyle and Beauly. He said: \"We know branches are important to many communities, but equally we know that fewer people are using them as more people bank online. In every case of a branch closing we are committed to providing the best possible range of alternatives.\"Tuesday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

No doubt they will. But the truth is that most people in Scotland lost patience with the SNP a long time ago.It is four long years since we held the referendum campaign and agreed it would be “once in a generation”. We fought that contest in the hope that, one way or another, it would put the issue to bed. Fat chance. Before the results were even in, the SNP was crying foul and the long, relentless drive for a re-run began. Brexit provided Nicola Sturgeon with her perfect excuse to put it back on the table. We saw a conference speech by the First Minister dominated once again by the same old arguments: independence is coming, independence will cure everything, independence is the only way forward. The Nationalists have become the ultimate stuck record.: Nicola Sturgeon: Scottish independence ‘clearly in sight’None of this would matter too muchthe SNP wasn’t also running the Government in Scotland. Unfortunately it is. And we are suffering the consequences. Nicola Sturgeon said two years ago that education would be her number one priority in government. Yet, staggeringly, in her speech yesterday there was barely any mention of education at all. It was a glaring omission but in truth it is little wonder – the SNP has dumped its flagship education bill, has lost the trust of many teachers on the front-line, and is presiding over a crisis in teacher numbers and restricted subject choice.After  years in Government, the SNP is looking tired.

For months, they#ve kept up the pretence that they were wary of a second referendum on the EU, worried that it might damage the case for the vote they really want # on independence.They were never going to be able to keep that one up forever under irresistible pressure from inside and outside the party. But using the cute line that the SNP “won’t stand in the way” of a so-called People’s Vote kept up the suspense.It also allowed Sturgeon, who has nothing new to say about the timing of indyref, to show her hand on a second EU vote instead: SNP MPs will vote for it. Well, there was only one other option.The other interesting language from the First Minister’s interviews ahead of her big speech today is around a ‘blind Brexit’ – the possibility of the UK and EU agreeing little more than Brexit orce terms, and leaving the details of what post-Brexit trade will look like to thrash out later.: Theresa May: Good Brexit deal means end to austerityIf that’s what emerges from negotiations, then it might not be until the end of the transition period in  that the true shape of Brexit emerges. There is even talk of the UK staying within the EU customs regime until the next general election in , to allow time for the thorny issue of the Irish border to be resolved.That could help give Sturgeon the justication to argue that another vote on independence must wait further – perhaps until after the  Holyrood election, when the SNP could use the issue to try boost its mandate.

Pile up a stack of local newspapers on any given day from across the country – indeed the world – and it will be peppered with as many stories about potholes as west Edinburgh’s Dundee Street is by the real thing.More ‘sophisticated’ media outlets may scoff, but potholes are a great leveller: they represent a universal experience of urban decay. Like many British cities, Edinburgh is a grossly unequal place, but there’s egalitarianism in the terrible state of its roads. Potholes really are an everymanproblem.They also sum up the failure of local government: councils bearing the brunt of austerity have neither the money to fix the potholes that are already there, nor do they have the powers to stop new ones from forming.The cost of fixing Scotland’s roads is thought to exceed £ billion across the UK, it could be as much as £ billion. Meanwhile, local authorities can do little to stop utilities firms from ravaging freshly laid road surfaces.: Video: What a hard Brexit could mean for ScotlandPotholes are far from the only symbols of urban neglect. In so many other ways, local government has been powerless to protect the fabric of urban le: to stop big shopping developments draining the high street to shake down developers for the cost of essential infrastructure to support new housing to maintain good transport links outside the big cities to stop employers leaving or attract good, new jobs to replace them.What have humdrum local government gripes got to do with Brexit  Research from the Carnegie UK Trust suggests quite a lot.A report published last month, Remaking British Towns after Brexit, highlights that neglected and impoverished urban areas – too small and too distant to benefit from the economic engines of cities – were where the highest concentration of Brexit votes could be found.While cities and rural areas draw the attention of policy makers, towns fall in between and are often forgotten. As one of the authors, Glasgow University professor of public policy Duncan McLennan, reflects: “These dficulties primarily arose because of UK failures in managing places rather than membership of the EU.”Calling for a much more targeted approach to how power and investment is distributed to local communities, Professor McLennan warns that “although it may be too soon to really know what the precise impact of Brexit on towns will be, it’s clear that there needs to be action now to ensure that present neglect ends ... whether Brexit is soft, hard or even cancelled.”Devolution has so far meant giving new powers and money to national parliaments, to London, and latterly to big, articial urban agglomerations. Could the constitutional shake-up of Brexit mean that is about to change : Theresa May: Good Brexit deal means end to austerityOn the day the Conservative Party conference got underway in Birmingham last week, Scotland on Sunday revealed that the UK Government was preparing to take control of hundreds of millions of pounds in EU Structural and Investment Funds, previously administered by Holyrood, which are now likely to flow in large part directly from Westminster to Scottish local authorities after Brexit.It’s a move that will require little change to the devolution settlement as set out in legislation, but could produce a huge sht in the power relationship between Edinburgh, London and local communities.South of the border, where there isn’t the possibility of an independence referendum to influence the politics of who gets what money, a cross-party group of ‘metro mayors’ is now asking for control of money from the new UK Shared Prosperity Fund that will replace EU development money. Which approach will actually serve the needs of the UK’s neglected towns We think of Brexit a dam breaking under the pressure of enormous, pent up demands: a rejection of mass immigration and a rebellion against globalisation, or a yearning for sovereignty and a more accountable politics.That may be true, but how much were those feelings incubated in crumbling urban settings stripped of their locus of control All politics is local, it’s been said. Those trying to stop Brexit and those trying to deliver on its promises would do well to remember that, and start by filling the potholes.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4811894.1539069790!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon snp promises hope during an unfolding calamity","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon will call for her SNP colleagues to offer Scotland #optimism and hope# in a drive for independence as she closes their party conference today.In her keynote address to the gathering in Glasgow, the First Minister will say that Scotland could be a “beacon for progressive values” once it is outside the UK.Describing the handing of the Brexit negotiations by Theresa Mayas an “unfolding calamity”, she will call for the SNP to put forward a message of hope over the “despair” offered by Westminster.Read more: Scottish independence vote ‘can happen without Westminster approval’Ms Sturgeon will also announce an extension of fair work rules across the public sector, with the goal of increasing the number of Living Wage employers and reducing the gender pay gap.Read more: Poll: Unionists would accept Scottish independence to get Brexit“The Westminster Government stumbles from day to day and disaster to disaster.

On one side of the equation was the need to assure them that action on indyref is imminent. On the other side was the more pragmatic and less appealingtask of telling them that more has to be done to persuade Scotland to vote for independence.: Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP Conference speech RECAP: Scottish independence now ‘in sight’: Nicola Sturgeon addresses SNP conference: Keynote speech in fullIndependence is ‘in sight’With the first side of the equation at in mind, it did not take long for the SNP leader to declare that the goal of independence is “clearly in sight” as she referenced great victories of the past in Motherwell, Hamilton and Govan.“It is now up to us to honour those who went before and win our country’s independence,” she said to applause.The applause and cheers were to hit the Richter scale when she issued a stern warning to Tory and Labour politicians on the referendum question.“You can oppose independence – that is your democratic right,” she said. “But you cannot – and you will not – deny Scotland’s right to chose.”\u2028Indyref could be held without Westminster approvalIt was a phrase that went down well and had echoes of Brexit Secretary Michael Russell’s suggestion earlier in conference that indyref could be held without Westminster approval.But there was a less rapturous reception when the other side of the equation came into play. The applause was more muted for her appeal for “pragmatism, perseverance and patience” when it came to a second independence referendum.Praising the passion demonstrated by independence marchers on the streets of Edinburgh at the weekend, she said: “Our job is to take that passion and blend it with pragmatism, perseverance and patience to persuade those not yet persuaded.“If we do that, then believe me - the momentum for independence will be unstoppable.”This was perhaps the most telling extract of the speech. Her use of the future tense was acknowledgement that independence momentum was not yet unstoppable. And her plea for patience was an admission that more work has to be done before there is any guarantee that the SNP can win a second vote.Very little said on the Growth Commission There was little more than a passing reference to Andrew Wilson’s Growth Commission, which was supposed to be at the heart of the fresh independence drive but has been criticised for embedding austerity.Some passages were devoted to defending the SNP’s record in government at a time when its record – particularly in education and health – is under fire.\u2028Brexit pivotal part of SNP’s independence argument\u2028But the strongest rhetoric was reserved for the UK Government and its “shambolic” approach to Brexit and its record of treating Scotland with “contempt”.Ms Sturgeon was at pains to contrast her open and outward looking vision of Scottish independence with Westminster’s insular approach to Brexit.The UK, she said, was facing warnings of medicines shortages, grounded aeroplanes, gridlock at ports and a haemorrhaging of investment.She pointed out that the first Minister for Food Supplies had been appointed since Winston Churchill was Prime Minister.It was a sign that her argument that only independence can free Scotland from the chaos of Brexit is going to be put front and centre of political activity over the coming months. Only time will tell whether this delivers a second referendum and her wish for a vote for independence.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4812450.1539098674!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon addresses snp conference keynote speech in full","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon addressed the party faithful in her keynote speech at the SNP Conference in Glasgow.Here is the First Minister’s speech in full.\u2028\u2028: Nicola Sturgeon: SNP promises ‘hope’ during an ‘unfolding calamity’: Nicola Sturgeon: Brexit makes Scottish independence ‘inevitable’\u2028\u2028Friends, years ago today I sat in another auditorium in this city, listening in awe to the great Nelson Mandela.It was an extraordinary occasion. One that no one who was present will ever forget.The people of Glasgow were the first in the world to grant Mandela freedom of their city.And in so doing, they led the global fight against apartheid.It was shortly after his release from prison, that he came here to say thank you.Nelson Mandela knew then what we all know now.People really do make Glasgow.ConferenceThere are many privileges that come with the job of First Minister.One of them is being patron of our women’s national football team.I was given that honour two years ago.And what do you know – shortly afterwards they qualied for the European Championships.This year - under the brilliant leadership of Shelley Kerr - they’ve gone one better.Don’t worry.I’m not about to break into a chorus of – “we’re on the march with Shelley’s army.”Yet.But what a fantastic achievement. At long last, Scotland is going to a World Cup.And it’s our women leading the way.The achievement of Shelley and the team is just one of many memorable moments for Scottish sport this year.Jamie Murray winning another US Open.This city playing host to the European Championships.Our rugby team lting the Calcutta Cup at Murrayfield.It’s always brilliant watching our athletes succeed at the highest levels.Their achievements inspire us.Very few of us can be world class sportsmen and women But we can all learn lessons from those who are.Setting goals. Perseverance. Resilience. Eyes on the prize, no matter how hard the path, at times, might seem.For many in the SNP’s long history, our goal – the goal of independence – would have seemed a long way off.But the dedication to building a better Scotland never wavered.Over the decades, victories in Motherwell, Hamilton and Govan laid the foundation for the success we enjoy today.We are a much more privileged generation - our goal is clearly in sight.It is now up to us to honour those who went before and win our country’s independence.In government now, we’re building a country that plays its part in meeting the global challenges of our age.Climate change. Automation. An ageing population. Countering the forces of intolerance.How we respond to these challenges will affect how we live, work and interact with each other for generations to come.Much of the pressure politicians face today is for instant answers and short term action.But governments have a duty to plan for the long term.The Scottish Government is living up to that responsibility.By contrast, the Westminster Government stumbles from disaster to disaster.It is a shambles.It’s hard to watch that unfolding calamity with anything other than horror.Let’s be frank - a political system that throws up Jacob Rees-Mogg or Boris Johnson as contenders for Prime Minister has clearly gone very badly wrong.That is why it is up to us - now more than ever - to offer optimism and hope.It was once said that -“To be truly radical is to make hope possible, rather than despair convincing”.Never giving in to despair. Making hope possible.That is the dference between our party and Westminster.Of course, making hope possible is not just about words.It’s about action. Delivering progress in the here and now.Giving a secure home to those without a roof over their head.Helping families on the lowest incomes.Supporting children at risk of going hungry.Our goal is to create a fairer, more prosperous Scotland where that sort of intervention is no longer necessary.But in government we’re working, day in, day out, step by step, to change lives for the better.And that is something to be proud of.It might not always be recognised by the doom-mongers in the opposition parties.OK, I’ll rephrase that - it is never recognised by the miserable doom-mongers in the opposition parties.But though there is so much more to do, the groundbreaking work already being done here in Scotland is recognised across the UK and around the world.Our actions to tackle climate change have been called ‘exemplary’ by the United Nations.And they will make Scotland one of the first carbon neutral countries anywhere in the world.The work of the Violence Reduction Unit has won plaudits from the World Economic Forum and is now being replicated by the Mayor of LondonEven the UK Tories praise our approach to community sentencing and reducing re-offending. It’s just a pity that the shameless opportunists in their Scottish wing continue to oppose it at every turn.Our work to tackle period poverty has drawn praise from the United States.“Awesome and important. Thank you, Scotland, for leading the way.”That was Cha Clinton.And just two weeks ago, Bernie Sanders praised our actions on fair work.Of course, in the interests of balance, I should point out that the current incumbent of the White House hasn’t said anything nice about us at all!Maybe we should take that as a compliment.And then there’s Labour.Now,you don’t mind, I won’t waste too many words on Scottish Labour - except to say that “branch office” now seems to be a gross exaggeration of their status.But the UK Labour conference two weeks ago was like an SNP policy tribute act.So here’s an offer, Jeremy.You say you want to bring water into public ownership.The next time you’re in Scotland, I’ll show you how to run a public water company.And while you’re here...I’ll show you how to abolish prescription charges.I’ll show you how to get rid of tuition fees.I’ll take you to Dalzell steelworks or the Fort William smelter to show you how to deliver an active industrial policy.And while you talk about a fairer tax system, I’ll show you how the SNP has already delivered a fairer tax system.You see, for the SNP it isn’t just rhetoric. We win public support, we get ourselves elected, we put our money where our mouth is and we improve lives in Scotland each and every single day. And just think how much more we could do, free of the chaos and incompetence of Westminster.Just think how much more hope will be possible when we take Scotland’s future into Scotland’s hands and become an independent country.An independent Scotland, just as Scotland is now, will be a beacon for progressive values - equality, opportunity, ersity and fairness.Indeed those values feel more important today than at any time in my le.In the face of rising prejudice and intolerance across the world, I am proud that our party welcomes those who come here from other countries.To everyone who has chosen to make Scotland your home, no matter where you come from, let me say this again today.We value your contribution.Ours is a better country for having you here and we want you to stay.And to the Prime Minister, my message is blunt.It is great that the son of an immigrant is your Home Secretary.But don’t expect praise when you are denying others the chance to build a le here.Actions, Prime Minister, speak louder than words. End your hostile environment policy and end it now.The SNP is meeting the challenges of the future head on.That means building a fair and inclusive economy.We’re providing more help to business than ever before.We know that without sustainable economic growth, there can be no sustained social growth.So we will always champion Scotland’s businesses.But we will never accept a Tory race-to-the-bottom on wages and workers’ rights. We are committed to fair work.More security, decent pay and a greater voice for workers in the companies whose wealth they help to create.Fair work is good for everyone. It drives innovation and productivity.And that makes for better businesses and higher profits.Of course, Westminster still controls employment law.And Labour and the Tories want to keep it that way.I know why the Tories don’t want the Scottish Parliament to protect workers’ rights.But Labour backs that position too.Proof it were needed that Labour isn’t the workers’ party.Labour is just Westminster’s party.Only with the powers of independence can we give the full force of law to our aspirations.But we’ll push the boundaries as far as we can.We’ve already made payment of the real living wage part of our procurement process.We’ve extended it to adult social care workers.And we will soon do the same for early years workers.As a result of all of that, I can confirm today that Scotland now has the highest proportion of employees paid the living wage of any UK nation.But we must do more.Last month, we said business support grants from Scottish Enterprise would have living wage, zero hours contracts and gender pay criteria attached.Some saw that as a challenge to companies like Amazon.Well, last week Amazon announced that it would pay the living wage.So, I can announce today that, working with unions, business and the public sector, we will extend that approach.We will adopt a new default position. Fair Work First.The support Amazon received is just one type of business grant that public money pays for.By the end of this parliament, we will extend fair work criteria to as many funding streams and business support grants as we can.We will also extend the range of Scottish Government and public sector contracts that fair work criteria will apply to.And we will maximise the benefit of public contracts to small businesses and local supply chains. Yes, details will y depending on the size of companies and the circumstances of dferent sectors.But let me be clear what our Fair Work First approach means.Investment in skills and trainingNo exploitative zero hours contracts.Action on gender pay.Genuine workforce engagement, including with trade unions.And payment of the Living Wage.We may not yet have the constitutional power to make fair work a legal requirement.But we do have the financial power of government to make it a practical reality.And we will make that count.Conference,We’re doing even more to boost the economy for the long-term.By the end of this Parliament, Scotland will have a new government-owned National Investment Bank. That will be transformational.We will be well on the way to meeting our new target for infrastructure spending.That commitment will mean £ billion of extra investment in schools, hospitals, housing, transport and low carbon solutions.That will be transformational too.A new Infrastructure Commission will advise us on investment priorities.And I can confirm today that the Commission will explore the feasibility of a government-owned National Infrastructure Company - a policy backed by this conference in June.We are building a new Scotland here at home.And we’re putting Scotland firmly on the map.While the UK Government turns inwards, the Scottish Government is looking outwards – building our nation’s reputation and connections.We’re expanding our international presence to boost exports.We now have permanent operations in Dublin, Brussels, Washington, Beijing, London and Berlin.Last month we opened an office in the capital city of Canada.And I can confirm today that our new office in Paris will be open for business next month.Not so much an auld alliance – but new alliances, not just in France and Europe, but right across the world.Winnie Ewing’s prediction is coming true. We don’t even have to stop the world. Scotland is just getting on.Over the past year, our overseas goods exports have grown faster than in any other UK nation. Half of our exports come from manufacturing.Another of our long term commitments is a National Manufacturing Institute.Based in Renfrewshire, linked to Strathclyde University and backed by £ million, it’s been called a factory for the future.Today, I can announce even more support.To spread the benefits of the new Institute, we will target up to £ million of European funding to set up an Advanced Manufacturing Fund, helping small and medium sized businesses modernise and grow.In the s, the Tories did their best to wipe out Scottish industries.The effect was to de-industrialise our country.Now, as we approach a new decade, we are rebuilding.The SNP is re-industrialising Scotland.Friends,We are building an economy for the future – making hope possible.That starts in the earliest years, with our commitment to double childcare.And it runs through our work to close the school attainment gap - this government’s top priority - and ensure equity of access to university.Providing world class education and flexible skills is the best long term plan to tackle poverty.But every decent society also needs a strong social security safety net.Social protection is a collective endeavour.A national expression that we care for each other.That we belong to something bigger than ourselves.The wilful damage being done to social protection by the UK Government is a scandal.The two child cap and the rape clause. Attacks on disability support. Sanctions that leave people destitute.It is callous. It lacks heart. It is the hallmark of a government that just doesn’t care.Universal Credit is causing misery - that is now beyond doubt.Even the Minister responsible says that it could cost families £ a month.While the Prime Minister tries to claim that they are ending austerity. Shame on them. The experience in areas where Universal Credit is already implemented - like the Highlands, Dundee, East Lothian and South Lanarkshire - is of rent arrears and increased reliance on food banks.Next in the firing line is this city of Glasgow.FriendsIt is unacceptable that in st century Scotland, people are unable to eat as a direct result of Westminster government policy.So to the Tories we say this.Find some compassion. Halt the roll-out of Universal Credit now.With our limited new powers over social security, we’re building a modern, rights based system.We’ve set up a new agency, Social Security Scotland.It will employ  people between its Dundee HQ and its base here in Glasgow, and a further  in local communities across the country.Which just goes to show - More powers for the Scottish Parliament means more services delivered in Scotland.And that means more jobs for people who live here.Just one more reason why Scotland should become independent.The new Agency has made its first payments already.Over the last few weeks, more than , people have received the first instalment of the new Carers’ Allowance Supplement.That’s an SNP policy giving carers more than £ a year extra.Let me share with you a message I got from a carer the other day. One of many.She said: “I just received my carers allowance supplement and I’m not ashamed to say I had a wee cry to myself. This is the first time I’ve been thanked for what I do and not questioned.”Now, I’m pretty certain that won’t make headlines.But it’s real. It makes a dference. It speaks to the kind of country we are working to build.And - just like the Baby Box, the £ school clothing payment, the new Best Start Grant - it is happening only in Scotland. And it is happening only because of the SNP.It is making hope possible.That is what our government is about. And I am proud of it.Friends,Building houses that people can afford is another strand of our long term work. In her speech last week, Theresa May made a big deal about lting the borrowing cap on local councils.The SNP has never applied a cap in Scotland.Which maybe goes some of the way to explaining this quite remarkable fact.Over the last five years, more council houses have been built in Scotland than south of the border.Not proportionately. In absolute terms.We’ve built more council houses than a country ten times our size.Overall, we’ve delivered , new affordable homes in our time in government.And I can confirm today that we are on track to reach our , target in this term of parliament. That’s vital to meeting our moral responsibility to eradicate homelessness and rough sleeping.Of course, many people who become homeless have complex needs that require specialist support as well as a home.Traditionally the approach has been to provide support and get a person ‘tenancy ready’ before giving them a house.That means they can spend long periods of time in temporary accommodation, making it harder for them to address the other issues they face.We want to change that.We’ve joined with the charity Social Bite to introduce what is called Housing First.With that, the priority is to help people into settled accommodation first, so that they can access support from the security of their own home.Social Bite is contributing money raised at the Sleep in the Park event last year, which saw  hardy souls - including our own Deputy First Minister - sleep outside on one of the coldest nights of the year.I say, that’s what deputies are for.Social Bite’s investment will enable  people with some of the most complex needs to be supported into permanent accommodation.People are already benefiting.One man, who has been homeless on and off since the age of  said this:“Housing First has given me the key to a whole new le. Before, every day was a struggle, but now I’m so happy here.”We want to help Social Bite go further.So I am delighted to announce today that the Scottish Government will increase our investment to £. million.This will allow, not , but  people to be lted out of homelessness for good. That’s making hope possible.Friends,The National Health Service is our most precious public service.All political parties say the same.But not all political parties are the same.To those itching to open up our NHS as part of a trade deal with Donald Trump, let us be clear.If you go down that road, prepare for the political fight of your lives.We will never allow you to put Scotland’s NHS in danger. Like health services everywhere, ours faces big challenges.With our commitment to record investment and vital reform, we are determined to meet and overcome them.Of course, at the heart of the NHS are all those who work in it.Every patient, every parent, every family, in every home in Scotland knows how much we all owe them.So let us thank them again for all that they do.But thanks alone won’t ensure that we have the staff we need to keep the NHS going strong.That’s why we have given our nurses the best pay rise in the UK.And it’s the reason for another commitment that I am making today.In England, the number of trainee nurses has fallen dramatically as a result of the decision to scrap the student nurse bursary.In Scotland, we retained the bursary. It is not means tested and its value today is £, a year.But recruitment is a big challenge. And it will get even bigger as Brexit bites.So we need to attract more people into nursing.That is why I am announcing today a three stage plan to increase the support we provide.At our last conference I said that all care experienced young people at college or university would get a bursary of £, - equivalent to the real living wage.This year we will match that for all care experienced student nurses.From next year, the payment for all student nurses – care experienced or not - will rise to £, a year.And then from the year after, every student nurse will get a bursary of £, a year. We know the value of our nurses. We know the value of our NHS.And to anyone from across the UK attracted to a career in nursing, our message is simple.Come to Scotland. Friends,Our government is taking action to improve lives now and prepare Scotland for the future. But all of that is happening in the shadow of Brexit.Labour and the Tories promised us in  that Westminster would provide strength and security. That boast was at the very heart of their Project Fear campaign.Now it lies in the Brexit ruins.Westminster hasn’t delivered strength and security.It has brought chaos, incompetence and confusion.And it has killed off any Project Fear campaign against independence, once and for all.Brexit is costing jobs and hitting living standards.Our young people are losing the opportunity to study, travel and work freely across the EU.The work of our world class universities, researchers, creative artists and so many others is already being damaged.And for what In , we were told we had to reject independence to protect our place in Europe.Today, we face warnings of medicines shortages, grounded aeroplanes, gridlock at ports and a haemorrhaging of investment.They’ve even appointed a Minister for Food Supplies, for goodness sake.We haven’t had one of those since Winston Churchill was Prime Minister.ConferenceIt brings to mind those immortal Churchill words about the sacrices of the RAF in World War  -“Never was so much owed by so many to so few.”Well when the history books tell the story of this Tory government, selfishly driving the UK towards a hard Brexit just to appease its own ideologues, the verdict will be damning.Never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few.The SNP supports membership of the European Union for a simple reason.Independent nations should co-operate for the common good.The EU isn’t perfect - but it’s one of the world’s best examples of that principle in action.And whatever disagreements there are about whether the UK and Scotland are better off inside or out of the EU, one thing is surely beyond doubt.This UK Government’s handling of these negotiations has been shambolic, chaotic, and utterly incompetent. days since the Brexit referendum happened.Just  days until exit. And yet no one has any idea what the UK’s future relationship with the EU will be. That is a disgraceful failure of leadership.ConferenceThese negotiations have also brought into sharp focus the dference in status between Scotland and independent members of the EU.Independent Ireland has received nothing but solidarity from its European partners.Westminster has shown Scotland nothing but contempt.FriendsThe independence we seek is the very opposite of Brexit.Brexit is about turning inwards, pulling up the drawbridge, retreating from the world.Independence is about being open, outward looking, aspiring to play our full part in the world around us.And it is about partnership.Real partnership - with our sister nations across the British Isles and with our friends in Europe and across the globe.You know, it seems to me that one of the lasting casualties of Brexit is the notion that the UK is in any sense a partnership of equals.Our vote to remain in the EU ignored.The Scottish Government’s compromise plan to stay in the single market dismissed.Our request for a role in the negotiations cast aside.A raid on our parliament’s powers.And when the Scottish Parliament said no to that raid, the UK Government could and should have respected that decision.Instead they took us to court.That’s not partnership. That is Westminster control. Scotland deserves better.And now we have Tory and Labour politicians queuing up to tell us that the decision about Scotland’s future belongs, not to the people, but to Westminster.That they will decideand when we can choose to be independent.Well, let us send this message today.You can oppose independence - that is your democratic right.But you cannot - and you will not - deny Scotland’s right to choose.Friends,Scotland chose to remain in the EU.We did not choose this Westminster fiasco.In recent days, we have argued for the Article  process to be extended to allow disaster to be averted.That would allow more time for a sensible single market option to be pursued.And it would allow time for another vote to take place.On that, let me make our position clear.If there is a proposal for another EU referendum, SNP MPs will vote for it.But let’s not kid ourselves.There is no guarantee that another vote won’t deliver the same outcome.Scotland choosing to remain but still facing exit against our will.Brexit is a serious problem for Scotland. But that is only because of a more fundamental issue.Our future is not in our own hands.Scotland’s future is in Westminster’s hands.And the only solution to that is to become an independent country. FriendsI said earlier that independence is the opposite of Brexit.The way we make and win our case must also be a stark contrast to a Leave campaign that was shameful, deceitful and very possibly illegal.People look at how parties campaign and conduct themselves, and they make judgments about who we are, the values we hold dear and the kind of country we want to build.So let us resolve today - in everything we do - to embody the positive, progressive, inclusive change we want to see.The passion in our movement - demonstrated on the streets of Edinburgh at the weekend - is wonderful.It gladdens my heart.To those who say there is no demand for Scotland to have a choice over our future, I say - the polls and the people are telling a dferent story.Our job is to take that passion and blend it with pragmatism, perseverance and patience to persuade those not yet persuaded.If we do that, then believe me - the momentum for independence will be unstoppable.So let the passion shine through.But let us always strive to see the argument from the other point of view.We have a duty to answer questions as fully as we can.We owe the people of Scotland no less.The future relationship between the UK and the EU will determine the context in which Scotland would become independent.And so the detail of that will shape some of the answers that people want.But as we wait - impatiently, at times, I know - for this phase of negotiations to conclude and for the fog of Brexit to clear, be in no doubt about this.The last two years have shown why Scotland needs to be independent.And I am more confident than ever that Scotland will be independent.Friends,Our task now is to step up our work to update and strengthen the case.The Sustainable Growth Commission set out the opportunities that are there to be grasped in an independent Scotland.We must show people that with the powers of independence we can fully realise our country’s vast potential.And take our case to every home, community and workplace across the land.With independence we can turn our wealth and resources into better lives for everyone who lives here.We are a renewable energy powerhouse.Our universities are among the very best in the world.Our food and drink industry is the best in the world.Our tourism industry is booming.We’re at the cutting edge of the technologies of the future.Above all we are a talented and educated people.So, yes, let’s debate Scotland’s economic future. Let us address concerns and answer questions.But never, ever, let anyone tell us that Scotland doesn’t have the talent and resources to be a successful independent country.The economic potential of our nation is enormous.And more people now think the Scottish economy will be better off with independence than staying with Westminster. It’s our job to build on that growing sense of confidence.So that when the time comes- and it will -the choice facing the Scottish people will be this.The ever tightening grip of Westminster control.Or a hopeful, outward looking independent country.An independent country in a modern partnership of equals across our islands. A country with the ability to take our own decisions.To invest in our economy, our schools, hospitals and our people.And not waste a single penny on weapons of mass destruction on the River Clyde.Friends,I don’t really think of Scotland as a small country.I think of it as a big family.And, yes, that does mean the occasional disagreement.But throughout it all, we care for one another.We fight each other’s corner.We’ve got big hearts.And we’re not afraid to show love.And there is so much about Scotland to love.The majesty of our landscape, the humour and ingenuity of our people and the huge contribution we’ve made and continue to make across the globe.But pride in who we are today must never stop us believing in and working for an even better country and a fairer world.That’s why all of us are in this party.I joined the SNP in  – trust me, in those days you had to be an optimist to join the SNP.We’ve come so far since then - both our party and our country.And we’ll keep moving forward, by using the privilege of government now to change lives for the better.And by offering a vision of even brighter days ahead.I was an optimist back then.And I am an optimist still. Optimistic for our country. And hopeful, yet, for that better world. Our goal is simple.A fairer country, for all those born here.For those who have chosen to make this their home.And for the generations yet to come.That is why we believe in an independent Scotland.So know this. Believe in this.Work for this.Hope is possible. A better future is within our grasp.And together we are going to make it happen.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David. Your warning shots make me feel that I should grabfew bottles of whisky 🥃 go back to bed and snooze my way through the day even though there’s a hot Indian summer outside.!!Seriously , weare facing a dire situation which will impact on my grandsons far more than on me —— or you. When you say ‘Agriculture’ I’m assuming that you are including livestock.The greenhouse gas emissions from the planet’s animal le must be enormous and that’s whether or not they are raised for their meat .Also, to take your point, such vast amounts of money are tied into food production , it’s hard to seeany measures at all, however well intentioned, , will enable us to eradicate the decline of le in its widest sense.Time to grab that whisky bottle I think 🤔.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League.

Added to this, a further four football pitches worth of the reserve land would be temporarily lost to the construction site to accommodate the construction activities and the associated diggers, cranes and other heavy machinery.\"But the effects of the road scheme on the reserves wildle will extend far beyond the extent of roadworks activities.\"The noise and activity associated with the A construction works, and the increased traffic flows and the imposing road structure once the road is completed, will cause many birds to keep their distance and not attempt to nest or feed within several hundred metres of the road site.\"Transport Scotland has bought land at Dellmore near Insh Marshes and proposes to convert some of this to wet grassland to accommodate the homeless wader bird species from Insh. While RSPB Scotland has welcomed this, the charity said it will be hard to convert this land for the waders, and maintain it as such over the long-term.The spokeswoman said: \"It is far from guaranteed it will provide suitable habitat, and evenit does, the new habitat will not be big enough or suitable to rehome all of the waders that would be made homeless. Neither will it address other harm to wildle.\"Karen Birkby, RSPB Scotlands site manager at Insh Marshes, said several suggestions made to Transport Scotland to minimise impact on the nature reserve have been ignored.Aviemore Community Council made similar claims last week that their concerns had fallen on stoney ground over plans to construction the dual carriageway on the village side of the current A as part of the Dalraddy-Slochd section. They said it will impact on the popular Milton Woods.Ms Birkby said: \"We have continually made the case for protecting the exceptional wildle of Insh Marshes, minimising harmful impacts, and maximising environmental benefits such as enhancing or providing suitable new habitat nearby.\"While we welcome the intention of converting some land at Dellmore to wet grassland, it is far from guaranteed that it will provide suitable habitat for all the wildle affected.\"We understand the need for the A dualling but believe that it can be built in a way which minimises its impact.\"We have suggested several ways in which Transport Scotland could do this but disappointingly, they are not proposing these measures in the latest plans, so there is a real risk that the road scheme will result in long-term harm to a iety of wildle.\"We encourage local people to view the proposals online or attend the public exhibition and raise their concerns before the deadline of October .\"The proposals for Crubenmore to Kincraig went on show yesterday in Newtonmore Village Hall.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in , having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.After a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on  minutes, and never looked back.Evan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from  yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.Greg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.Newtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.The second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the  minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.Seconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.When Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.Newtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of , was his first final.MacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.He said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”Lovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard.

Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent.

CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"council wants scotrail to help ease disruption on stromeferry","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineScotrail are currently considering a proposal to terminate rail journeys at Strathcarron to allow road traffic to flow more freely through the ersion on the Stromeferry bypass.At a meeting in Lochcarron last week, Colin Howell , Highland Council’s head of infrastructure, said that the ‘road to rail’ ersion on the bypass, where important stabilisation work to the rockface is being carried out, could stay open to traffic for an extra  minutes each dayScotrail would agree to do this. It would involved taking passengers by bus from Strathcarron to stations along the line to Kyle of Lochalsh.At the moment, even when a train has gone passed the bypass, that section of line must remain closed until the train reaches either Kyle or Strathcarron. Mr Howell said that Transport Scotland and Transport Minister Michael Matheson are considering this.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said Scotrail are looking at the proposal, which will have to be approved by the Mr Matheson. to facilitate the essential works on the Council’s A road.“We appreciate that, notwithstanding this cooperation, there is disruption for road uses during the passage of the normal train service. We have asked colleagues in the ScotRail Alliance to considerthere are any practical options further to minimise disruption to road users during the road works whilst still maintaining services upon which rail passengers depend.”Skye and Lochalsh MP Ian Blackford supported the introduction to the buses from Strathcarron.He added: “Network Rail seem to be sticking their fingers in their ears over this. A number of mistakes from both the rail company and Highland Council have led to the situation that we are in now and have been for some time.”“Network Rail must stop some of the trains coming from Inverness at Strathcarron and then arrange a bus service going onto Stromeferry. That would alleviate the ridiculous waiting times that passengers travelling by road are experiencing.”“The current way of working has caused no end of problems. We have kids being stranded on buses for hours and cues over  cars deep in both directions. To be fair the council at least seem willing to listen.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1061971.jpg--.jpg?1538469852000\n","title":"hot air balloon makes history by touching slemish summit","story":"The Little Ollie Balloon Team has created a piece of history by being one of the only hot air balloons to make a connection with the top of a mountain, when they recently touched the highest point of Slemish.It is hard for a balloon to land on top of a small space as often balloons do not come to a total stop, they drag a little, therefore the team were able to make a brief connection and landed further down the mountain.The Little Ollie Balloon Team have been in business for  years and are run by Henry Law and pilot Richard Pearse.Flying for  years, Richard is fully qualied with a private pilots licence for balloons and airships.He knows how to accurately read wind and weather patters and enjoys the tranquility of being in the air, so being associated with a little bit of ballooning history has definitely been a highlight for him.Speaking to the , Richard said: Being able to touch the top of Slemish was brilliant.As the top of Slemish is too small to land on, we made brief contact and then moved on to a nearby field.“When we first took off, I wasnt sure that we would be able to land, but the wind was just right as we approached it, so I thought why not give it a try! When flying its important to work with the wind to plot the direction and path of a flight.Richard explained that hot air balloons work because hot air rises.By heating the air inside the balloon with the burner, it becomes lighter than the cooler air on the outside.This causes the balloon to float upwards, asit were in water. Obviously,the air is allowed to cool, the balloon begins to slowly come down.Henry Law, owner of The Little Ollie Balloon Team is a member of the retrieve team. He said he was delighted the balloon was able to make contact with Slemish. HISTORIC MOMENT He said: In order for me to retrieve the balloon when it lands, we use very precise location finders and two way radios, however I was able to see the balloon on the side of Slemish.Richard had radioed through to me to say he thought he would be able to make contact and Im so glad our on board GoPro camera captured the historic moment!Expalining how the balloon comes into land, Henry said: We normally like to land in a green field, and always try to seek the permission of the land owner before doing so.We pick non-crop fields and ones without livestock so as to cause no damage or inconvenience.Quite a large area is needed for landing as sometimes the balloon travels along the ground before coming to a stop, therefore the top of a mountain wouldnt have been safe to try to make a total stop.“However, making contact is a great achievement and we are so proud we were able to achieve it.

Although Rubys short le was filled with complex medical needs, it was a le filled with love from her parents Lisa and Andy, little brother Ezra and her wider family. Rubys mum Lisa told the : Ruby had the most precious personality. Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her. Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she done it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family. Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care. This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  . We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us. This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby. So, to remember Ruby on her birthday we are holding a birthday party fundraiser, with all money raised going to the Northern Ireland Childrens Hospice.The NI Childrens Hospice is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland providing care to  children with le limiting conditions. The annual running cost of the Hospice is pound.million, that is for four rooms of the  the hospice has - the hope would be to get all  rooms funded and running.The government support is only % of this, thats why the Hospice relies so heavily on fundraising events to keep this facility running for families like ourselves.Lisa is also planning to launch a blogging website called chasingladybirds in October. This will help Lisa to share her own journey, Rubys le and in turn provide support for other families going through similar experiences.A face book page called Ruby Powells Journey and an instagram page ChasingLadybirds was the prelude to this, giving family and friends the opportunity to be updated throughout Rubys treatments and milestones.Lisa said: Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started. In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief. Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.There will bouncing castles, soft play, face painting, nail painting, cake sale and a raffle with an array of great prizes. There will even be a live male wax at pm!The fun kicks off at pm until pm and most importantly all money raised goes towards this vital cause - a poignant and fitting way to remember little Rubys legacy.

If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8658944.1538772078!/image/image.jpg","title":"northern

A spokesperson for Dromore Nursery said: “As outstanding early years educators, we aim to offer every child equality of opportunity, it has not always been easy to translate this aspiration into practice.

Each child is unique and brings a wealth of le experience, within their family and community, to their school setting. Children need to feel that the adults in the nursery are interested in, and value them as iniduals and they need to have access to experiences, resources and images that make them feel they are known and respected.“This is the environment and opportunities which both schools have been offering to the children in Dromore and Lurgan for the last  years.“Both Dromore and Drumnamoe Nursery Schools have established outstanding practice in promoting communication and cooperation within their classrooms and actively foster within the children and wider school community a respect for themselves and others.  “The children in both schools have the opportunity every year to experience a wide and ied programme across all areas of the pre school curriculum with specialist resources and experiences available in areas such as roleplay, small world play, construction, creative arts, sand and water play, pre writing activities, a erse snack and dinner routine.Both schools have award winning outdoor classrooms which provide extensive opportunities to engage all their senses.“The two schools engage in a wide programme of extension experiences including class exchanges and staff exchanges which involves children and staff swopping schools for a day.“There is also an extensive parent programme which offers parents from both schools the opportunity to be involved in a range of activities, which ranges from social events to employment opportunities and training.“Within the two erse communities in which the schools are located both Dromore and Drumnamoe Nursery Schools receive extensive support and encouragement for their programme of events.”      UFU welcomes speed limit at local schools Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8661702.1539074186!/image/image.jpg","title":"health  ","story":"Action Mental Health#s eating disorder service within the Southern Health and Social Care Trustarea has been relaunched, introducing a vital and effective new model of support for people experiencing eating disorders and their families  carers in partnership with the SHSCT.

On the one side are those who think that an orgy of union jack-waving to the strains of Land of Hope and Glory is an excellent idea on the other side are those with a titter of wit.Squinter can recall two similar Ulsterfests in his letime, both of them when he was a youngster. The most recent one was the queen’s  silver jubilee, when Britain vos celebratink der th anniversary von der coronation von Elizabeth Saxe-Coburg und Gotha. Loyal Ulster being loyal Ulster, it ended up cheering loudest and, West Belfast being West Belfast, we decided to celebrate the auspicious occasion with a non-stop summer of rioting as a result of which Squinter’s right arm remains sore to this day.The earlier one was the rather creepy and sinister ‘Ulster ’’ – a celebration of  years of partition that was held on land between Botanic Park and the Stranmillis Embankment. The idea was hatched in December  by Prime Minister Terence O’Neill: “In that yearNorthern Ireland will celebrate its th anniversary –  years of challenge and dficulty and occasional disappointment, but also  years of splendid achievement, of growing prosperity, of expanding opportunity.”By the summer of , though, when the gates opened to the public, Terry was out on his ear, having been done for by a combination of opposition by UUP hardliners to his limited programme of civil rights reforms and a series of UVF bomb attacks on Belfast’s water supply. He jacked it in in April  and in an interview a month later he revealed the depth of his passion for reform: “It is frightfully hard to explain to Protestants thatyou give Roman Catholics a good job and a good house they will live like Protestants because they will see neighbours with cars and television sets they will refuse to have eighteen children. Buta Roman Catholic is jobless and lives in the most ghastly hovel he will rear eighteen children on National Assistance. If you treat Roman Catholics with due consideration and kindness they will live like Protestants in spite of the authoritative nature of their Church.”Ulster ’ cracked on regardless, although the loss of a man so imbued with the spirit of egalitarianism must have been a crushing blow. An expectant public surged through the gates when the exhibition opened in May for a five month .Looking back at the photographic and filmic evidence that survives, it’s clear that the attractions on the site were, ah, modest, to say the least. Let’s see now… there was a big, multi-coloured plastic model of the Giant’s Causeway over the door of the main indoor space there was, um, a model of a Shorts plane hanging overhead there were fairground ridesthere was a disco with go-go girls a £m satellite was launched containing a message of peace from Ulster to any le forms who may happen across it. .By far the most exciting thing to happen during Ulster ’ was the introduction of internment, which wasn’t technically part of the show although doubtless it was wildly popular with a fair percentage of Ulster ’ attendees and organisers.The last bit of air went out of the balloon when it was finally decided that there would be no royal visit because the safety of the afore-mentioned Saxe-Coburg von Gothas could not be guaranteed.As for posterity, the BBC – normally an enthusiastic booster of Our Wee Country – reported in an article in : “The official government report did not describe it as a success and ultimately it is remembered as a bland effort in self-promotion for a state that was teetering on the brink of implosion.”Which brings us back to Gammonfest – sorry, the Festival of GB and THP. What’s that going to look like on this side of the Irish Sea border in four years time  Well, flags, of course – there’ll be plenty of those. But then there always is, so Ulster’s going to have to do a bit of thinking outside the box here. Marches – ditto. Bonfires – ditto. What about a festival, then  One with a funfair and the Giant’s Causeway and.. and.. never mind, you get the idea. We could call it Ulster ’. Or Catch . Which might make a bit more sense."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-05-at-10.07.27.png","title":"ridiculous rules stop family clearing grave","story":"A WEST Belfast man has hit out at “ridiculous health and safety rules” which have left Belfast City Council staff unable to remove a large tree that fell on his parents’ grave during storm Ali over two weeks ago.Riverdale man Gerry Osborne says he was shocked when his son rang him to tell him that the tree had fallen down on top of his beloved parents’ headstone in the City Cemetery.Speaking to the Andersonstown News at the graveside, Gerry said: “We can see my parents’ grave from the Falls Road and it’s a great comfortyou’re driving or walking past just to be able to see it.“I always bless myself and say a prayer for them. My son was on the bus on this way into work when he looked over in the direction of the grave, he was shocked to see this massive tree lying on it, he rang me immediately and we headed up to speak to the cemetery staff.”It was during the course of a conversation with Council workers that Mr Osborne was informed that Council employees are not permitted to use chain saws to cut away fallen tress and that they have to wait on an outside agency coming in to carry out the work. He was also told he and his sons wouldn’t be allowed to do the job themselves.Gerry added: “I was shocked to hear this, I was more than willing to come up with my sons and remove the tree myself but I was told I couldn’t.“The cemetery staff have been very helpful and sympathetic, but the tree is still here over two weeks later, and it’s not exactly small. Whatone of us has an accident while we are here tending the grave  I understand that Belfast City Council’s hands are tied, they have been great, but we feel asthis outside contractor who has to carry the work out is in absolutely no hurry to do so, these are ridiculous health and safety rules.“The cemetery itself is beautul and very well kept by the staff, so whoever is responsible for cleaning up this mess needs to take a leaf out of their book and get on with it.”West Belfast Sinn Féin Councillor Stevie Corr said: “Under health and safety legislation council staff are not permitted to use chain saws, they are going through the proper process at the moment, but I know that is of no comfort to the Osborne family who are clearly and understandably upset.“I am a representative on the Strategic Cemeteries and Crematorium working group and I will raise this issue as a matter of urgency, I will also be raising the issue around giving our cemetery and park staff back the skills and authority to use chainsaws to cut down and remove obstructions like this. This is obviously outsourced and we want to bring it back in house again.”Cllr Corr added: “The matter was only raised with me today and we are already working on getting it dealt with.”A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said: “We are aware of a number of damaged and fallen trees at City Cemetery, caused by Storm Ali. A specialist company is working to clear these but, because of the amount of damage, this is taking some time. However, our contractor is working as quickly as possible and we hope to have all the debris cleared in the near future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"3k for northern ireland man told he was too old for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

In his evidence, which the tribunal accepted, Mr Matier recalled that when he was giving his details to a man at the premises he was asked to state his age. When he replied that he was , he was told: \"I was looking for a younger person who I could train and move upstairs.\" Mr Matier askedthere was any point in continuing the conversation, and was told: \"No, not really.\"He said: \"I had been keen to get this job, and to be told I was too old to even apply for it really shook me. \"I had been off work for a while and I was trying to get back in to work. It was disheartening and it made me angry that my application could just be dismissed in this way because of my age.\"In its finding, the tribunal acknowledged that the incident \"had the effect of signicantly discouraging the claimant\". It added: \"This had been caused entirely by the behaviour of the respondent and this behaviour was motivated by age discrimination.\"Mr Matiers claim was supported by the Equality Commission.Mary Kitson, senior legal officer at the Equality Commission, said: \"This case is an important reminder to all employers not to make generalised assumptions about people on grounds such as age, which are protected by anti-discrimination law.\"It is unlawful under the Employment Equality Age Regulations of  for any employer to discriminate on grounds of age in the arrangements they make when offering employment.\"The tribunal in its finding noted that Mr Matier \"was, in effect, given no opportunity on the grounds of his age\".

Border checks could even include lasagne after Brexit , DUP claims Labour accused Mr Raab of “pretending that everything is going according to plan” and urged him to “scotch rumours” that the Government is not intending to publish an Irish border backstop proposal by next week, before questioningan “indefinite UK-wide customs union” would be part of the offer.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer also asked Mr Raab to rule out a “vague or blind Brexit”, adding: “No government has the right to plunge the country into chaos as a result of its own failure.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The UK is leaving the EU “Time is running out but there is still time to change course and I urge the Secretary of State to do so.”Mr Raab, in reply to Sir Keir on the suggestion of an indefinite customs union, said: “No, categorically that is not correct.”He suggested Sir Keir had almost become the “prince of process” given his questions before accusing Labour’s leadership of having “trashed their promise” at the last election to deliver on Brexit.Labour MP Christopher Leslie, former shadow chancellor, askedMr Raab was ruling out a blind Brexit and “we will have full details of that trade relationship for the future”.“First of all there’s no question of some kind of blindfolded Brexit,” Mr Raab said, going on to insist the withdrawal agreement would contain substance and detail on the future relationship.He said: “We want to make sure in the political declaration on the future relationship that we have enough detail and enough of substance so that this House and the country at large can understand the choice of the model of economic and security cooperation that we’re going to be pursuing.”Conservative backbencher Peter Bonesuggested a “Chequers +++” proposal is the “way forward”the Prime Minister’s Brexit blueprint fails.He said: “Obviously he would like to get a Chequers deal, but as that has already been rejected by the European Union – and I have to say in some ways insulting the Prime Minister in the process – and that he thinks coming out without a deal is sub-optimal, shouldn’t we learn from a former great Labour prime minister about a third way “And surely Chequers +++, is that not,Chequers fails, the way forward ”Mr Raab said the Government would not “just take the face value, ‘computer says no’ approach” and instead continue to press its case to get a good deal in Brussels.Conservative former home secretary Amber Rudd later criticised the “gung-ho approach” to no deal as she warned that security matters are not yet in place to keep the UK safe in such an event.She said: “I remain very concerned about the somewhat gung-ho approach to no deal given that the security matters are not yet in place to ensure that our country remains safe from terrorists, safe from organised crime, and that the EU has the same benefits.”Mr Raab replied: “I’m confident that in the medium to long-term we would of course resume all of the kinds of cooperation that one would expect, but it’s right to say that in a no deal scenario we could not rely on the EU to continue that in the short term.”Tory former Brexit minister Steve Baker, of the European Research Group of MPs, argued the UK could secure a free trade arrangement with the EU.He said: “Time and again customs experts from a range of countries in the EU including Holland and Ireland tell us that a free trade agreement can be made to work across the Irish border using pragmatic arrangements.“When will the Government take this key that has been handed to them, keeping us in the prison of this negotiation, and admit that we can leave into an FTA basis which will make this a proper independent country able to control its domestic regulations as well as its tarfs so that we can lead the world into a new era of free trade.”Mr Raab replied that his suggestion was a “shortcut to no deal”.We will not tolerate anything that separates Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK in terms of customs or single market as we leave the EUNigel DoddsFacebookTwitterHe replied that “whilst it may be theoretically possible for us to do that, we cannot do it and have a deal with the EU”, adding: “The EU are not offering us Canada, super Canada, an FTA without keeping to the commitment that we made when he was in Government in December to come up with a legally binding backstop, so that is a shortcut to no deal and we’ve always said that we’d be readythat outcome is forced on us, but the optimum aim here, the optimum objective that we’re working towards is a good deal with the EU. We couldn’t get thatwe pursued what he’s suggesting.”DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said his MPs “would not tolerate” any separation of Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and threatened to withdraw support as they did last December.He said: “The idea that the sort of proposals that are floating about from the EU side, and indeed some officials on our side in Brussels, are necessary to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland is of course complete rubbish.“There already is infrastructure on the border and there are already financial, fiscal and other dferences because it’s an international border.“Of course it can be managed.“He needs to understand that as far as we’re concerned, as the Democratic Unionist Party, we will not tolerate anything that separates Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK in terms of customs or single market as we leave the EU.“We’ve been clear about that from day one.“It’s why we had the debacle in December.

Smartphone owners will only remain brand-loyal for so long before realising there are better alternatives on the market.”In contrast, Ru Bhikha, mobiles expert at uSwitch, said the power of the Pixel  camera would be the key feature for many smartphone enthusiasts considering upgrading. “The handsets, like their predecessor, place the camera front and centre,” he said. “These top-of-the-range shooters boast features like the new ‘Top Shot’ and ‘Color Pop’, with the former allowing users to capture photos at exactly the right time with its burst ality.”“The Pixel  XL is the choice for smartphone photography purists though, as the two front-facing cameras will ensure you get the best quality selfies.”He added that the pricing of the two devices, well below that of the new iPhone XS range, could also entice in buyers.“Interestingly, Google has not followed suit with other premium smartphone manufacturers this year, which have all released handsets which tip over the £, budget. “Instead, the Pixel  and XL shoot for premium specs but without the accompanying price tag.”"},{"url":null,"title":"11 rules people would enforce immediately if they ran their","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Of particular interest to local readers will be sections on Saul mdash the place of Patrickrsquos landing.Observing the interest of those outside Ireland on St Patrick, John began thinking seriously about his book project five years ago.He said: ldquoSt Patrick is so obviously supported across the world ndash what is it that causes that support ldquoI was brought up outside Downpatrick in Loughinisland. I assumed I knew everything about St Patrick. I wanted to see ndash what do we know about St Patrick  I wanted to go back. I wanted an anthology of peoplersquos writings throughout the centuries, build up a picture of what he was and what he means throughout our history over , years.John said some of his findings were a ldquototal surprise, such as the article by Maureen Donnelly lsquoThe Altar Stone of Saul Abbeyrsquo. This details how the altar stone on which Patrick is said to have celebrated Holy Communion ended up on a wagon owned by a man who wanted it for the doorstep of his new house at the junction of Saul Street and Scotch Street in . But the wagon overturned, the stone broke and it found its way instead to the Catholic Church in Saul.ldquoI never realised there was an altar stone of St Patrick actually in Saul chapel, John said. ldquoI went three times to try and see it. I could not get in the first time as there was a ceremony on. It took me a bit of time to find it. This is one of the earliest and possibly holiest relics in Ireland open to all to see.John said he was also ldquoblown away by a stained-glass window, lsquoPatrick Arrives in Saulrsquo, in Saul Chapel.ldquoThe three windows are designed so the three windows show one image, he explained. ldquoIt is absolutely beautul.John is the author of many books, including The Irish Christmas Book and The Unkindest Cut: A Cartoon History of Ulster -, as well as books on the Irish famine and the United Irishmen.Surrounded by sites linked to our patron saint in Downpatrick, John believes at times we ldquocanrsquot see the woods from the trees.He points to the massive success of less important sites in the south, or how such a historical location would promoted ldquoto the nth degree in the US.ldquoI think that is the challenge for people here today, he said. ldquoThere is so much scope, there really is. I think we lose the wood from the trees. So many stories, so many things to pursue.Interestingly, his research points to an attitude from some in the south of Patrick being a ldquonorthern saint. There is also, of course, the increased secularisation of Ireland.ldquoBut there are still a massive amount of people who are people of faith, John continued.ldquoWe live in an area of huge historical importance.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

Stonegate chief executive, Simon Longbottom, commended the graduates and the Stonegate development team.He said: ldquoPeople are at the heart of what we do. Wersquore delighted to able to recognise the achievements of our incredibly hard-working Accelerators here at the House of Commons. The course is a shining example of how commitment in personal development can change peoplersquos lives, as they fast become the companyrsquos most promising managers and future industry leaders.\"Reaching our th milestone is a really proud moment for Stonegate and the House of Commons is a fitting place to celebrate. As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth.

Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And so the detail of that will shape some of the answers that people want.ldquoAs we wait ndash impatiently, at times, I know ndash for this phase of negotiations to conclude and for the fog of Brexit to clear, be in no doubt about this. The last two years have shown why Scotland needs to be independent.ldquoAnd I am more confident than ever that Scotland will be independent.She blasted the UK Government for taking Holyrood ministers to the Supreme Court, after the Scottish Parliament refused to back the UKrsquos EU Withdrawal Bill and instead passed its own Brexit legislation.ldquoThat is Westminster control, the First Minister declared.And she hailed independence as being the ldquoopposite of Brexit,offering Scotland the chance to have a ldquoreal partnership with other countries across Europe and the world.While much of her -minute long address focused on the big issues of Brexit and independence, the First Minister included a number of policy announcements.FM: So know this. Believe in this. Work for this.Hope is possible. A better future is within our grasp. And together we are going to make it happen. #SNP pic whhcoklmmdash The SNPOctober , Bursaries for student nurses ndash which were retained in Scotland after being scrapped south of the border ndash will be increased from pound, a year to pound, a year by the year -.Such a move will help Scotland attract more people into nursing when the recruitment challenge which already faces the health service becomes more challenging in the wake of Brexit.That was welcomed by the Royal College of Nursing, whose Scotland director Theresa Fyffe said: ldquoThe increased bursary is an important step in valuing those who choose to nurse and in making nursing an attractive career.Meanwhile the charity Social Bite will receive pound. million for work to help vulnerable people with complex needs find a settled place to stay.Mentions in Nicola Sturgeonrsquos speech today.Education ndash Independence ndash There is only one priority for the SNP: separation, not schools.mdash ScotConservativesOctober , This money, Ms Sturgeon told the conference, will help ldquo people to be lted out of homelessness for good.To help small to medium sized businesses looking to expand and modernise, she revealed up to pound million of European cash would be used by the Scottish Government to set up an advanced manufacturing fund ndash saying that by doing this the SNP were ldquoreindustrialising Scotland.But the Tories claimed there was little in the speech apart from independence, with Conservative MSP Annie Wells branding it ldquoa tired speech from a tired government which has run out of ideas, apart from the only one theyrsquove ever had.She added: ldquoNicola Sturgeon asked her supporters to stay patient ndash the truth is that most people lost patience with the SNP a long time ago.ldquoAstonishingly, in a speech littered with references to independence, there was just a glancing reference to education.ldquoIt was a staggering omission and it tells you all you need to know. Education isnrsquot her number one priority ndash the only priority the SNP has is separating our country in two.Scottish Constitutional Relations Secretary Mike Russell earlier said supporters would have to wait for the lsquoright momentrsquo for a second independence referendum Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said while education was the ldquosupposed top priority of Ms Sturgeonrsquos government, this had ldquobarely merited a passing mention in her speech.Meanwhile Pamela Nash, chief executive of the pro-UK Scotland in Union group, said: ldquoNicola Sturgeon made it clear what her only goal is ndash independence at any cost.Liberal Democrat MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton also hit out, saying: ldquoNicola Sturgeon needs to stop trying to turn Brexit into the break-up of the UK.But Mark Ruskell MSP from the pro-independence Scottish Greens said: ldquoBrexit is already causing chaos and will result in an unprecedented loss of civil rights.ldquoIndependence in the EU is the right choice for Scotland, giving us self-determination whilst working with neighbours to build a better Europe..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Sturgeon declares Scottish independence is  uclearly in sight u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers.

He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.
