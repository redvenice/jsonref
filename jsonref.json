How can you isolate an infected person in these conditions?\u0027 asked Buss.Beyond the high population density, unsanitary conditions in some dwellings also pose problems.\u0027In the favela, most houses have few windows, which prevents good air circulation, prevents daylight from entering and promotes the spread of respiratory diseases,\u0027 said Patricia Canto, pulmonologist at the National School of Public Health.In particular, tuberculosis continues to wreak havoc in the favelas, with infection rates sometimes 10 times higher than the national average.\u0027For the coronavirus, we say that we must protect the most vulnerable by talking about the elderly, but we must not forget the cases of social vulnerability,\u0027 said Canto. In addition, many people depend on the informal economy to make a living, and confinement risks taking away all forms of subsistence.Rio has so far escaped the total confinement regime being experienced in much of Europe and neighbouring Argentina.But schools and shops have been closed, as have beaches and other tourist spots, where many street vendors from poor neighborhoods sell their products.\u0027People who do not have a formal job must continue to go out to work because they have no choice.

Although his cautionary Americana fables didn’t always have a happy ending, the raspy-voiced musician delivered them with more warmth than a shot of bourbon around a campfire, somehow ensuring that you always ended up smiling.But the celebrated country singer, who has died of natural causes at the age of 81, wasn’t just great at telling stories through song. He also used photography, releasing several books, and receiving an honorary degree from the Professional Photographers of America (PPA). “He’s obviously well-known as an entertainer,” said PPA president Ralph Romaguera when giving Rogers his award in 2014, “but he truly is a remarkably talented photographer, too.”Covering landscapes and portraits, Rogers’ images shift between giddily capturing the larger-than-life personas of such friends as Ray Charles and Dolly Parton, to documenting the natural beauty of America’s vast countryside. He could make familiar sights look like a fairytale: his glowing night time shot of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC, proudly uploaded to his Facebook page in 2017, makes the 16th US president look more like a mystical levitating god than a statue for tourists to mill around.Armed with a 35mm Brownie Hawkeye, Rogers enjoyed taking long walks on the look-out for unique trees. The camera also became a way to stave off boredom while touring America and bringing his signature brand of accessibly nostalgic country pop to fan-filled arenas. “I only worked an hour a day,” Rogers said of life on the road in 2014. “That meant I had 23 hours with nothing to do.”In that interview, with Sports \u0026amp Entertainment Nashville, he added: “So we’d get up in the morning, get in the car, and drive around whatever city we were in and ask the locals whether there was anything good to shoot. A lot of the time they’d say, ‘No, I’ve lived here 30 year and there’s nothing.’ And then you’d turn round the corner and you’d find Niagara Falls.”Although he loved taking portraits of his fourth wife, the model Marianne Gordon, Rogers clearly saw photography as much more than just a hobby. At the height of his fame in the 1980s and 90s, he found time for private lessons with acclaimed photographers, from Yousuf Karsh to John Sexton. “Karsh taught me how to capture the personality of a celebrity by making them feel at ease,” said Rogers. “When you see them totally relaxed, that’s when you shoot. John taught me the importance of really loving what you photograph.”Working under these giants of photography, Rogers reached another level. His equipment grew more sophisticated, too. He moved from a Linhof Master Technika 4x5-inch to larger-format cameras capable of producing more arresting 8x10 negatives. The Thumb, one of his most striking shots, captures a digit-like mountaintop in bold black and white. With the moon hovering low in the sky and the stark rock outlines, it resembles a still from a science-fiction movie, lit with dark mystique. Like many of Rogers’s environmental photographs, it has real depth, accentuating the shadows. It’s as if he was suggesting that America, even at its most beautiful, had something sinister lurking in the darkness. You could say the same about many of his songs, particularly Ruby, Don’t Take Your Love to Town.His celebrity portraits are particularly vivid. In 1987, Rogers published Your Friends and Mine, full of portraits of superstars from Elizabeth Taylor to Michael Jackson. He also photographed the likes of Willie Nelson and Tammy Wynette for his 2005 photo book This Is My Country. Most of these celebrities looks at ease and relaxed, acutely aware that the person behind the camera was one of them and had no agenda.That said, Rogers’s shot of Michael Jackson awkwardly clutching his pet chimpanzee Bubbles like a ventriloquist’s dummy feels as if it was intended to be a little more ironic than his usual work. Here, arguably, Rogers captured the unnerving bombast of Jackson’s eccentric celebrity more clearly than just about any other photographer.One of Rogers’s biggest lessons came from the Canadian portrait photographer George Hurrell, who taught the singer how to create a connection with his subjects that would spill over into the final product.“He came down to my place in Georgia and spent some time with me,” Rogers told the Associated Press. “George said to me, ‘I am gonna tell you a trick. I call it the stolen moment!’ He said to talk to your subject about the happiest day of their life and also the saddest day of their life. Just as they respond to the question, you take the picture. It means they are not posing, but rather being who they truly are. It’s honestly such a great trick.”Often, when celebrities announce that they enjoy taking photographs, we brace ourselves for a dire, staged selfie or shot of a lurid pink swimming pool. Rogers was proof that, occasionally, a celebrity could be just as arresting behind the camera as they were in front of it.Last June, Rogers posted one of his photos to Instagram, something he did regularly in his later years. Taken while on tour, it deals with all the things the country singer seemed to be most fond of: epic mountaintops, gorgeous if slightly eerie moonlight, and trees that stand like gods. It’s easy to imagine a silver-haired Rogers, probably in a cowboy hat, smiling behind the camera, just taking it all in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0230f8dca10fe367d8be01b2600b05250067ea0/1503_153_5271_3163/master/5271.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dd5e498e6a92dfd91f053bdd03af0e7","title":"hard partying yba sarah lucas i was pretty wild honey pie","story":"As the shamelessly bawdy artist thunders towards her 60s, she talks about knobby guys, life in metal-detecting country – and coping with all her hair falling out last yearThere are three people in the foyer of the gallery grappling with a very large crate, easily two metres tall. “What’s in that?” I ask, edging around them. “It’s empty,” says the woman who seems to be in charge. “But it contained a sculpture called Elf Warrior. We’ve just set it up.” I ask why an elf would need such a big crate. “Because of its knob,” she says. “It’s huge.”Upstairs in the gallery a little later, Sarah Lucas introduces me to Elf Warrior, a bronze arrangement of loose limbs curling around the base of one very long and upright member. “This is kind of a portrait of a friend of mine,” says the artist, who is taking me on a tour of Honey Pie, her latest show, which was about to open at Sadie Coles HQ in London before the coronavirus crisis closed the gallery. “He’s called Olivier, which means Elf Warrior.”Not far away is Sugar, a cluster of breasts bound tightly together above two loosely dangling, pink-stockinged legs. The work is largely created from a sculptural material Lucas has very much made her own: stuffed tights. “Sugar seems to be a big favourite,” says the artist fondly. “She’s kind of like a bouquet of flowers. She’s pinkish so she’s sweet but she doesn’t look overly girly. Her nipples are tights stuffed with wool.”Lucas points cheerily to another “knobby guy”, currently having an undercoat dabbed onto the giant protrusion emanating from what may be his loins. “That guy’s called Dick ’Ead,” she says proudly, as if introducing her best pal. “He’s going to go on that chair over there. He’s concrete. He’s going to be painted a dark red.” She picks up a colour palette and shows me the exact shade.Honey Pie is the new chapter in Lucas’s Bunny series, originally conceived in the 1990s. The first sculptures in Bunny, largely made of found objects and stuffed tights, resembled female nudes reclining. They looked vulnerable and abandoned, as if they had collapsed into their chairs, or been dropped from a great height. In Honey Pie, however, the figures are more playful and colourful, almost cartoonish in their contortions – and they have seriously upgraded their wardrobes, particularly their shoes, which range from four-inch heels to platform trainers.“They are definitely more exuberant,” says Lucas, as we move to Sadie Coles’s office to chat. “Bringing in colour is the new frontier for me. It’s just something I fancied doing. And I don’t know anything about fashion shoes. I just go online and put in high heels or something.” She points to a pair of nude shoes on a blue-stockinged figure perched on a chair. “Those are kind of Louboutins, or rather they’re Chinese knock-offs.”And the tights, will any old pair do? “It can be any tights,” she says. “It’s been a lot of tights. But actually in this show, funnily enough, I got all the tights from Mexico. They’re a brand called Dorian Gray, which is quite funny. Weirdly enough, you use a material because it’s any material you can get anywhere. Then you realise some are better than others. Mexicans are quite robust. You can see it in their artworks – you could call it heavy-handedness. But there’s an incredible strength in all Mexican things. This also applies to their tights. They’re stronger. I use much stronger wire now, too, which can defy gravity more.”Lucas grew up in Holloway, London, the daughter of a milkman father and a mother who worked as a cleaner and a gardener. She has been called the wildest of the YBAs. Is that true? “I was pretty wild, but I wouldn’t say I was the wildest,” she says, suggesting that title actually belongs to her old friend Damien Hirst. “I was the next contender, probably, yeah.” She gives an infectious croaky laugh that speaks of late nights and roll-ups.Her prevailing subject is the body. In 2015, Lucas represented Britain in the Venice Biennale. The pavilion was painted a yolky yellow, a nod to her obsession with eggs and their prevalence in early works, such as Two Fried Eggs and a Kebab. Within sat two large-scale sculptures called Maradona, one boasting a three-metre penis. Alongside these were casts of women’s bottom halves sagging into furniture. “A lot of people would have preferred it if I had not put cigarettes in their orifices,” she says. “But you know, I tried to make it fairly classic and at the same time completely new. Sarah Lucas, right? So the cigarettes had to be in there and I don’t find it offensive.”She mentions she went out for lunch earlier today and the chat around the table had drifted back to the launch party for that Venice show. “I don’t remember a fucking thing about that party. I remember arriving and I remember leaving and getting the vaporetti home. But I don’t remember anything in between. I probably had considerable drinks. I think it was just because the whole thing was so overwhelming, right? It was just too much.”At the time she spoke of feeling torn: there she was representing Britain, yet she did not feel particularly representative of the country, nor it of her. Does she still feel that way? “I don’t know. I mean, it’s such a complex thing. These days everywhere’s getting more and more the same. It’s the same with men and women, we’re more the same than we are different. In some ways, nobody loves Britain more than I do, or British humour, or British TV, or British books. I’m much more into British culture than I am anything else.”As a remainer, though, she is no fan of the people currently deciding the country’s fate. “I can’t stand Jacob Rees-Mogg, even to look at him. I would describe it as harking back to a time irrelevant to now.”She looks out of the huge windows, at the blue skies over the London rooftops, and notices a colourful bowl resting on the sill, shaped and painted to resemble an octopus furling its tentacles around itself. “Beautiful,” she says. “That’s a Kris Lemsalu.”Lucas lives in rural Suffolk these days, with her partner, the composer Julian Simmons. Their house, nestling down a country lane, once belonged to Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears. “I still have a place in London,” she says, “so I’ve not totally given up urbanity. But quite truly, I am there more and more. To make these works, I got a studio in the town nearby. It’s a really historic town called Framlingham, but we just call it Lingham. It’s got a castle at the top, a beautiful church, a marketplace. Do you ever watch Detectorists? It’s set in that town.” She thinks the TV show does a good job of capturing the spirit and mentality of the townspeople.“I grew up in London and didn’t have any rural connections. It’s been an adventure of its own. It feels really like home, but also kind of a retreat, a haven from the rest of my life – not just London but the travelling and everything else, with getting older especially.”Lucas will be 58 later this year. How does the one-time hard-partying YBA feel about nearing her 60s? “It is a good question, and not having children doesn’t help you mature.” Do you ever wish you had? “No, not really. But a weird thing happened to me in October the year before last. I started losing my hair. I saw a tiny bald patch on my head, then gradually I started losing hair. It’s alopecia. By June last year, it had nearly all fallen out. My eyebrows had gone and everything. I’d resorted to wearing wigs a bit.“When I went to China in October for my next big show, I had a bit of white hair and still no eyebrows. But I remember getting to China, looking in the mirror, and seeing a dark shadow over my head. You can see I’ve got quite a lot of dark hair now, and some white hair, and my eyebrows have come back.”She’s wearing it pinned up today and you’d hardly notice but she’s clearly still reeling from the experience. “It was dreadful, like disintegrating. And you don’t know if it’s going to come back. I had to go very rapidly through biting the bullet. It was a major upheaval and I’m sort of getting over it now. It’s made me feel a bit more accepting of myself as an old person. Until then, I hadn’t quite had to look it in the eye.”When Lucas made her first Bunny, she described it as a “Eureka!” moment. Almost three decades on, that feeling of excitement clearly hasn’t left her. As we move back out into the gallery, she stands among her new additions, the stuffed-tights women and the knobby guys. Her eye is suddenly drawn to the pattern on the grey walls behind, which have a trace of white marbling up their surfaces. “It’s sort of like ejaculation,” says Lucas with a mischievous smile. “But maybe that’s just me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24f361682dc2154a09a9c06c47de2698b0fb3115/0_1754_8353_5012/master/8353.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3f37f86781cfab3b04c821733244676","title":"sacha alexis pazoumian life in earths deepest deep freeze in pictures","story":"It is one of chilliest spots on the planet.

At this point, there are no hand sanitiser dispensers so you cannot wash your hands. There are also areas where people touch. You don’t know what germs are being spread as a result.”The company said it plans to conduct body temperature checks on all workers entering the site to check for a fever and has banned handshakes to help prevent the spread of Covid-19. It also agreed to provide extra buses to halve the number of people travelling in each vehicle so that they can be seated at least two metres apart.Work on the HS2 high-speed rail project is continuing for now but a spokesperson said that may have to change.“Over the course of this week and into next, we will be reviewing the majority of works on our construction sites in line with government advice on dealing with Covid-19.”Other major construction projects such as Crossrail and two major hospitals that were delayed after the collapse of Carillion, have set out plans to prevent the spread of coronavirus and will remain open for now.The National Federation of Builders (NFB) said Britain’s construction industry was in an “unenviable position” between safeguarding workers’ health and averting an industry collapse similar to the 2008 financial crisis.Richard Beresford, chief executive of the NFB, said: “Our industry does not want to stop working. Until we are told by the government to down tools, we will be doing everything we can to support the safest possible working environment.”The government is understood to be wary about imposing restrictions on the construction industry, which is a major driver for Britain’s economic growth, at a time when the economy risks slipping into recession.The Hinkley Point project alone is expected to generate £200m of value for the south-west’s economy every year by contracting local businesses – almost £4bn over the life of the project.Dan Dobson, a Unite member, said workers on sites across the country feared speaking out or turning their back on a job because they were self-employed and had limited employment rights or protections.“Workers turned up at their sites this morning and expected to be told to go straight home. Instead, they were told it’s business as usual,” he said.“The government needs to close the non-critical sites and extend the wage support scheme to the registered self-employed, and they need to take those actions immediately. Construction workers cannot afford to miss out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb37104ed02dd2855772aca2ae88c01b4339ec9e/0_83_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88305556cc20d02e40e7cb6e2b75bb9b","title":"waitrose limits shopper numbers as physical distancing measure coronavirus","story":"Marshals will manage queues outside supermarkets as part of coronavirus restrictionsWaitrose is to begin limiting the number of shoppers in its stores at any one time as part of efforts to ensure physical distancing is adhered to during the coronavirus outbreak.The supermarket chain said restrictions would be specific to each store and it was introducing marshals to manage queues outside shops. Waitrose said it would also be taking further measures to protect staff, including closing checkouts where two assistants sit back to back. It has also ordered protective screens and visors for staff but it is not clear how long these will take to arrive.There will be a marked area outside each store where customers will be instructed to queue two metres apart.Bérangère Michel, the executive director for customer service at Waitrose’s parent group, the John Lewis Partnership, said: “While these measures will dramatically change how people shop and interact with others in our stores for the moment – they are absolutely vital to ensure that our customers can shop safely and that our partners are protected as they go above and beyond to serve shoppers in this time of crisis.”The moves comes as all the big supermarket chains are expected to bolster action on physical distancing to protect staff and customers from the highly contagious virus.The government lockdown announced on Monday included the closure of all “non-essential” stores. The new rules stipulate that retailers remaining open, such as supermarkets, must ensure there is physical distancing between customers and staff and that shoppers enter in small groups, so that spaces do not become crowded. The government has also ordered retailers remaining open to manage queues outside their stores.Lidl said on Tuesday it would be joining Morrisons, Aldi, Iceland and Sainsbury’s in installing protective screens for staff. Sainsbury’s and Tesco are also understood to be considering a limit to the number of shoppers in their stores at any one time.Christian Härtnagel, the chief executive of Lidl GB, said: “We hope this additional safeguard will help to provide extra reassurance for those both working and shopping in our stores.”The Usdaw union, which represents store workers, has called on retailers to protect staff further with measures including:Usdaw has also raised concerns that staff from Argos standalone stores, which closed on Monday, have been asked to work in Sainsbury’s supermarkets. The Usdaw national officer, Dave Gill, said: “With the overwhelming pressure on all food retailers, it is inevitable that companies are going to look at redeploying staff within the business. However, this is extremely unsettling for staff in what are already difficult and testing times for everyone.”Sainsbury’s is to keep open Argos concessions within its supermarkets despite the catalogue shops falling outside the “essential retail” category of stores ordered to close. Sainsbury’s said the concessions were staying open as they were part of its supermarkets. The retail group’s Habitat outlets have shut.Pressure on staff has intensified as shoppers stockpiled goods and switched from dining out to cooking at home. The closure of all non-essential retailers is likely to add to demand in supermarkets, with little capacity to increase home deliveries in the short-term."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/119e78808492e9201febe156fcc24743c27a5921/0_137_5385_3231/master/5385.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00322649db845a26113acaa856feae29","title":"global recession economy services factories covid 19 uk eurozone japan us markets business live","story":"PMI surveys show that firms in Britain, the eurozone, Japan and Australia are all suffering from Covid-19Pub chain Wetherspoons is facing heavy criticism today after telling its staff to get a job in Tesco instead.That, Labour MP Rachel Reeves points out, isn’t acceptable -- as staff could be out of pocked until the end of April. Unions are also shocked that the company isn’t providing more help.Wetherspoons, though, insists it’s doing the right thing - and looking to keep staff on despite being forced to shut down, saying:As we understand it, tens of thousands of hospitality workers and others have already lost their jobs, but Wetherspoon is retaining all its employees, using the government scheme for the purpose for which it is intended,” “Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin said to employees in a video that supermarkets were urgently looking for staff, since all trade from pubs, restaurants and cafes had transferred to supermarkets in the last few days. “Wetherspoon has had urgent calls from supermarkets asking for help in recruitment. Tesco alone urgently needs 20,000 staff, we understand.“Tim Martin said in the video that staff who wanted to work for Tesco should do so and they will be given first priority when Wetherspoon pubs reopen.“Wetherspoon believes that the actions it has taken are responsible and sensible in the difficult circumstances.”Amid all the gloom, here’s a heartening tale from my colleague Jasper Jolly:Ineos, the chemicals company controlled by the billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, is planning to build two hand sanitiser factories in just 10 days as part of the effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus.The UK’s biggest private company by sales aims to produce a million bottles of hand sanitiser a month when the plant is in operation, with talks under way with the NHS on supplying the products to hospitals for free.....Yesterday, drinks giant Diageo announced it is donating large amounts of alcohol for use in hand sanitisers, following a surge in demand from anxious customers. Some businesses are keen to do their bit.We are in an emergency situation – we need a full-speed, massive rescue package now.”Right, time for a quick summary after another busy morningBritain’s economy is heading into a deep recession, according to the latest survey of UK purchasing managers. Service sector activity is slumping at a record rate as customer-facing firms shut down, while manufacturers are also suffering from weak demand.Markit, which compiles the report, fears the recession could be on a scale ‘not seen in modern history’.The Eurozone PMIs were equally weak, suggesting the region is also falling into contraction. Both France and Germany’s service sectors are weakening at a faster rate than after the 2008 crisis, or the debt crisis.Construction firms are being hit too - with Taylor Wimpey halting work at its building sites today, and London’s Crossrail project being suspended a few minutes ago.Many UK shops are now shut, with the government rejecting Sports Direct’s claim to be an essential service.Supermarkets are facing unprecedented pressures - with Waitrose now limiting the number of people allowed in stores, and Sainsbury keeping its Argos outlets open.Nationwide is cutting opening hours, as banks and building societies come to terms with new ‘physical distancing’ rules.Ryanair is asking passengers to be patient, as it struggles with compensation claims after grounding most of its planes. The Bank of England has predicted that UK banks are strong enough to cope with the Covid-19.....and defended asking some staff to attend work in person.Despite the looming recession, the markets are more buoyant today.Coronavirus will likely also spell a further delay to the opening of Crossrail, my colleague Gwyn Topham explains: Transport for London said that all construction sites would be shut temporarily to limit the spread of the virus.  The opening of the London high-capacity rail line has already been delayed by more than two years, with its expected cost now around £18bn rather than £14.8bn. Mike Brown, London’s Transport Commissioner, said:“The Government and the Mayor have given clear instructions to stay safe and to stop travelling in all cases other than critical workers making absolutely essential journeys. “In line with this, TfL and Crossrail will be bringing all project sites to a temporary Safe Stop unless they need to continue for operational safety reasons. This means that work on all such projects will be temporarily suspended as soon as it is safe to do so. Essential maintenance of the transport network will of course continue.”Just in: Work on London’s massive Crossrail scheme has been suspended.Crossrail, Europe’s largest infrastructure project, was already running badly behind schedule -- but clearly authorities have realised that workers can’t maintain safe distances while building a massive tunnel underground.This might also take some pressure off the London transport network, so that purely essential workers (NHS staff, for example) can travel more safely.Despite the government’s tough new lockdown, some staff at the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority (the City watchdog) are at their desks today.Shruti Chopra of Financial News reports that a “very small percentage” of BoE staff are still required to attend work in Threadneedle Street in the Square Mile today, with a “handful” of essential FCA employees also in their offices.Boris Johnson was adamant last night that people should do the right thing, and stay at home if at all possible. Despite that instruction to conduct physical distancing, some London underground trains have been packed this morning.But a spokeswoman for the BoE insists that the central bank is complying with official advice:“The Bank of England has instigated a number of operational measures to protect the welfare of its staff and ensure that its critical functions will continue to be delivered unhampered.“In line with latest government guidelines, the bank is asking the maximum number of staff to work at home, consistent with being able to continue delivering its core functions seamlessly.”Here’s the full story.She also has good news about one early Covid-19 victim, an HSBC analyst, who seems to have recovered from the virus:Back in the markets, Wall Street is expected to rally sharply when trading begins in just over 90 minutes.Traders are watching for signs that Congress is getting close to agreeing a stimulus package to protect the US economy.But there’s also concern that the White House is considering relaxing lockdown measures, because of their impact on growth (as we’ve seen in the UK and the eurozone this morning).How much damage can be inflicted on the U.S. economy to try to mitigate the death toll from the coronavirus pandemic before it kills the economy? The Trump White House is increasingly raising that question. The answer could have grave implications for the health and livelihood of all Americans, amid the outbreak of COVID-19, the infectious disease that has been contracted by more than 300,000 people and claimed nearly 16,000 lives so far since it was first identified in December.President Trump on Monday signaled a potential shift in his administration’s strategy with a late Sunday night tweet saying “ we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.” He said he would evaluate the administration’s containment strategy early next week after a 15-day period elapses.Here’s my colleague Richard Partington on today’s dire PMI reports:The scale of the global economic damage amid the coronavirus outbreak is becoming clearer after early warning signs showed the steepest plunge in business activity ever recorded in Britain, Japan and the eurozone. As the pandemic intensifies and more countries shut down large parts of their economies to contain the spread of the virus, the closely-watched purchasing managers indices (PMI) for several of the world’s biggest economies fell to the lowest levels since records began more than two decades ago.The collapse on the index, which is closely monitored by the Treasury and the Bank of England, outstripped the slump recorded during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, as emergency public health measures disrupt supply chains and demand for goods and services evaporates.Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary has asked customers for patience with the processing of refunds or rebooking, in the midst of some passenger disgruntlement with the carrier’s response to the coronavirus. However, the consumer association Which? said that Ryanair was leaving customers stranded, especially in Spain. It warned passengers abroad not to accept refunds from airlines if they needed to get home, as it would mean they were no longer responsible for rerouting them onto alternative flights. The Irish carrier, which has not over the years built a store of goodwill from customers, expects virtually all flights to be grounded from today. O’Leary said it had offered its aircraft to EU governments for rescue flights and for the movement of vital medicines and supplies.O’Leary added that “this crisis will pass” and the airline was doing everything to keep its planes and crew operational and ready to return to flying when Europe is clear of the pandemic. Back in UK retail.... Sainsbury’s is to keep Argos concessions within its supermarkets open despite the chain falling outside the “essential retail” category of stores ordered to close by the government on Monday night.The retail group’s standalone Argos stores and Habitat outlets have shut. Shopworkers’ union Usdaw raised concerns that staff from Argos standalone stores had also been asked to work in Sainsbury’s supermarkets. “With the overwhelming pressure on all food retailers it is inevitable that companies are going to look at redeploying staff within the business. However, this is extremely unsettling for staff in what are already difficult and testing times for everyone. The Bank of England believes UK banks are strong enough to survive the coronavirus outbreak, despite forecasting a “more severe” short-term impact than its annual stress tests have been able to simulate. In the minutes of its latest meeting, released this morning, the Financial Policy Committee said: The FPC considered that the economic disruption associated with Covid-19 should have less impact on the core banking system than recent stress tests run by the Bank have shown the system can withstand.The coronavirus outbreak is forcing Nationwide to cut its opening hours.The building society says most of its 650 branches will now open 10am-2pm Monday to Friday and 9am-12pm on Saturdays. It says 50 have closed. Nationwide is ending an early opening hours trial for vulnerable people, following last night’s order to stay at home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f96b5ca75c76c48827dea05932bd5be727931904/0_232_6964_4179/master/6964.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bf8092a83e271289f4b0d4a41d1a0f8","title":"britain benefits rishi sunak claimants austerity","story":"A decade of cuts has ripped apart the safety net. People on decent salaries hit by the Covid-19 fallout are in for a shockMillions of people are about to discover something they didn’t know about British life. There is no longer a safety net. People who have paid tax and national insurance for years and never been near the social security system will be turning to it in their hour of need yet far too late, like trapeze artists falling through the air, they will find that the net beneath them has been lowered dangerously close to the ground and is badly torn.If these people once believed relentlessly misleading tabloid tales of benefit scroungers, they will have a rude awakening. They will find that when Iain Duncan Smith turned the screw on social security in 2012, he was right to warn claimants: “This is not an easy life any more, chum.” As if it ever was.Let’s hope that injustice is fixed. But even then, watch the shock as millions fall on the untender mercies of the Department for Work and Pensions, to discover what happened to benefits in the past decade. While never over-generous, by 2010 Labour had greatly lifted living standards for low earners, especially for children: Gordon Brown’s tax credits raised a million children and a million pensioners out of poverty. Since 2010, according to new research by Kerris Cooper and John Hills, a professor at the London School of Economics, children have lost a quarter of the support they had chancellor George Osborne and his successors took out a staggering nearly £40bn from benefits. Never “all in this together”, Osborne justified it by raining down abuse on low-paid families. The hypocrisy: as the current editor of the London Evening Standard, he ran Christmas collections for poor families! The Resolution Foundation predicts a third of children falling into poverty by 2023.Some cuts were secretive, uprating benefits by a meaner CPI not RPI inflation rate, a four-year freeze, and axing council tax support. Some made a noise – such as the bedroom tax, costing some families £14 week for a spare room. An early case was a Hartlepool family whose empty room belonged to their recently deceased 10-year-old. Housing benefit for renters was cut brutally. Introducing the two-child limit was exceptionally unjust.Torsten Bell, head of the Resolution Foundation, says people on £50,000 salaries have been anxiously asking him about benefits rates. They’re in for a shock, he says. Unlike the previous tax credit system, universal credit only allows savings of £6,000 (it takes steep deductions from savings up to £16,000). People hoping this is only temporary will be distraught at having to use up their rainy-day funds, often saved for years for a deposit on a home. The foundation is lobbying urgently to have this savings means-test dropped.Hills says a couple with two children will get £266 a week. And take from that £115 – the average amount that housing benefit falls short of rental payments. Many new claimants will run up rent arrears. Expect them to plunge immediately into poverty, miles below the £384 minimum income standard for a family of four, says Hills. Some singles will get a shock too. Under-35s will be living on £73, and only funded for a room in a shared flat, in the cheapest third of rentals in the area. Many who see themselves as middle class will confront the reality of Britain’s nonexistent safety net. It is, says the IFS’s Paul Johnson, “extraordinarily low”. One piece of advice from all these experts I’ve talked to: apply immediately, to limit these delays and debts. “Too many will wait, borrow from family, deny it’s happening to them, feeling the stigma. Apply at once,” says Torsten Bell.These millions discovering DWP brutality at first hand will no longer be deceived by the old poison shaming those on benefits as loafers, frauds and “not people like us”. Benefits offer penury, not a life of Riley. Rishi Sunak has been lavishly praised, not least for his empathic language: “We will be judged by our capacity for compassion”. But his compassion will be judged by how far he keeps benefit rates below the most basic poverty line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c722b8871aa37d8d5e2aca649f1d23f5491c7460/0_347_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a5efc5b2221c574bf85ca2cec561890","title":"self isolating kids tv","story":"From digging a hole to rearranging the cupboards, here are some novel ways to keep youngsters occupied at homeWhen your child’s idea of a good time is licking bus windows, throwing toothbrushes in the toilet or seeing how far they can sneeze, little words like “contagious” and “virus” can take on a rather urgent tang. And yet, as schools closed on Friday, how are parents supposed to cope? Presumably we’re all going to be here for some time and there’s really only so much Peppa Pig a human can watch before turning into a living Goya painting. So here, with a little help from my Twitter friends, are just a few pointers.First, you don’t have to be an expert in medieval history or thermodynamics to keep your child learning during a period of self-isolation. You can use clocks, watches and timers, for example, to learn about time. Similarly, you can use cake, pizza and oranges to learn about fractions (if, for any reason, you want to eat less than an entire cake or pizza in one sitting, something I am not prone to). You can also use daily activities such as timing a meal or fitting tupperware into a cupboard to practise quantities, spatial awareness and child labour. As an important side note, I had no idea until I had a small child quite how much they love cupboards and admin.Keep reading. Unlike that other indoor activity that your mother told you would send you blind, you literally cannot do too much reading. If you want to go all out and turn the book into a play, or build the characters out of plasticine, or draw your own illustrations, then, well, all power to you and your elbow.If you are lucky enough to have a garden, now may be the time to get into den-building, tent-pitching, picnicking, birdfeeder-making (out of old tins and seeds), minibeast hunting, gardening and – if all else fails – dig a really, really impressive hole. Damn it, if you have a big enough spade, you could probably build an Anderson shelter out there to fill with the survival essentials: plasticine, old spoons, bath toys and a poster of Thomas the Tank Engine. This may also be a good springtime opportunity for pressing flowers in big books, growing a moss garden, searching for “fossils” or “dinosaur teeth” (in our case, this is any old bit of stone or broken brick), making a leaf book and collecting sticks. It beats singing Baby Shark on repeat. Just.Once the lockdown hits and we’re in here for the long haul, feel free to indulge your inner children’s TV presenter. Make papier-mache masks over balloons. Make papier-mache tea sets and have a pretend picnic. Hell, make papier-mache anything – we’re going to be here for a while. Try a spot of potato-printing (if you’re not stockpiling potatoes) with poster paint. If you live in a house with stairs: try rolling the ball down the stairs, “tobogganing” down them in sleeping bags, “rock climbing” up stairs using only your arms, jumping off lower stairs on to a cushion crash mat. Hide toys – in a tray full of rice, lentils or any other dried food you’re going to boil afterwards anyway or around the house in shaving foam on a plate – at the end of a trail set out in a treasure map. Maybe plan a party (needless to say just for those you live with) – Lithuania’s Independence Day? Woohoo! Get drawing those flags! Google traditional food! Learn the country’s motto. If you want to stay on the pandemic theme, you can even make your own soap (if you can find somewhere to sell you lye). The internet is awash with recipes.If you’re really about to crawl up the walls, try @fiveminutemum on Instagram for more ideas, or @CosmicKidsYoga on YouTube for some guilt-free screen time and a bit of bending.When all else fails, try a very very long game of sleeping lions. As in, 45 minutes per round. Make those little squirts sleep until June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/225106035f42bbd1318348634b0f1165c36324d2/0_172_3620_2174/master/3620.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bf6645dffb6868a469f0d9f2fdfb347","title":"one oxford college has 96 of students from state schools how did they do it","story":"Mansfield College has risen up the league tables through its outstanding outreach workErin Minogue has vivid memories of her Oxbridge application process. The words hard and daunting crop up frequently as she describes her journey from a Midlands comprehensive, then sixth-form college, to one of the most elite universities in the world.Oxford has felt “one step removed from me”, she explains. “A friend of a friend had been, but I didn’t have any family reference points so it felt very tough.”Now, about to sit her English finals, Minogue is a testament to one Oxford college’s stunning success in the rebalancing of state and private school Oxbridge entry, one of the most hotly contested issues in public education.More significantly, the majority of those offers come from non-selective state schools and include a higher percentage of disadvantaged pupils, those from BAME backgrounds and from areas with low progression to higher education than the rest of the university. So how have they pulled it off, and why can’t others?According to Mansfield’s new principal, Helen Mountfield, they could. Mountfield is a barrister and former south London comprehensive schoolgirl – although from a middle-class professional family – who made it to one of the most exclusive colleges, Magdalen, in the 1980s.She believes Mansfield’s success, whereby the college has moved steadily up the Oxford Norrington table from bottom in 2007 to fifth this year, is down to its longstanding outreach work, its approach of putting each applicant’s achievements in context and the college’s “authentic” culture.“My answer to the social engineering point is that we don’t believe we are taking less clever people to make up for disadvantage. We are looking for the cleverest people from a pool where everyone is clever. We want the people who will walk out of the door as the finished article, not those who will walk in the door as the finished article,” she says.The college employs two expert access officers and makes a determined effort to present itself as a place that is open the website’s headline reads: “Open, Friendly, Welcoming. Mansfield has the highest state sector intake of Oxford”.“Applicants don’t have to worry about being in a cultural minority here, or whether they would fit in,” says Mountfield. “There isn’t really a cultural minority here. People come from all over and with different backgrounds.”The college also takes a painstaking approach to analysis of contextual data such as progression rates to university and levels of disadvantage in different parts of the country, GCSE and A-level results and free school meals (FSM) eligibility of each applicant’s school and whether they are care leavers.Perhaps the most contentious element of the Oxbridge admissions is the interview. A recent report from the Sutton Trust showed that six private schools and two state sixth-forms accounted for more Oxbridge offers than 3,000 other state schools and credited the availability of expert advice and preparation for that success.Mansfield College’s senior admissions tutor, Lucinda Rumsey, recounts one applicant explaining that the only interview she had experienced before coming to Mansfield was at Greggs bakery. She got in and graduated with a 2:1. Rumsey believes the interview process is a powerful tool for equalising access. “The important thing for selection is good pre-interview information, prior qualifications and a reference from a teacher who knows the student well and has seen them develop. Then we are trying to work out if candidates have aptitude for a particular subject and will thrive at it.“The interview helps us to do some nuanced work around that. Tutors as subject specialists are in a good position to assess potential. Almost all the applicants we get are well-qualified, and we have to make fine distinctions.“If candidates start out very well prepared by their school for interview, we try to see past that. If they have come from a school that rarely sends applicants to Oxford and have had no preparation, we want to see past that as well.“Some candidates can be inflexible in their thinking if we take them off their comfortable ground. Interviews aren’t only about getting a right answer but engaging with what is asked and thinking through a problem that it is difficult and unfamiliar.”The colleges’ access officer, Sara Harb, whose family moved to the UK from Jordan when she was five, recently graduated with a first in history after coming to Mansfield from an inner London comprehensive.“There were people at my school saying, ‘people from this school don’t go to Oxford’ but as soon as I got here, I realised everyone seemed friendly and normal and not geniuses or very posh,” she explains.“People from less well-performing schools often have to work really hard to get the grades and my school didn’t have the right interview prep but the tutors made me feel settled. I felt I was being challenged in an academic and friendly way rather than being set up to get caught out.”“In these Covid-19 times we see the starkly different home circumstances of students. We have students who are alienated from families, students who have been carers, share rooms with siblings, don’t have a desk or wifi at home,” she adds.“For us the next step is giving students access to equal chances after they leave, social capital as well as educational capital, so networks, grants for internships.”Dan Hall, a third-year undergraduate in PPE from a state school in Manchester, agrees that different education backgrounds also show up after admission.“For me it was ‘wow I am here, got to make the most of the experience’ rather than focus on career stuff. It is only later on that you realise you are behind the curve because they have been on a different path from the start.”Rumsey says there is a lot more pride in the state school access issue across the university, with conversations focusing more on the impact of privilege than disadvantage.“There has been a presumption in the past that the latter group are riskier. But once you have made this shift, and seen the impact, you know that isn’t true.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7367cb75e1db4941a372e03cdabf351513bd17e5/0_223_6720_4035/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2607fffb7253372ce5dead9200e40d1","title":"testing times for students food banks open at universities","story":"With maintenance loans now barely covering rent, many students are going hungryGemma Peacock has little money left over after she has paid her rent. She worked all summer to save up funds to supplement her university maintenance loan, but near the end of term she has a battle to make ends meet.“It can be stressful,” says Peacock, a 20-year-old psychology student at Leeds Beckett University. “If I’m struggling I will walk every day instead of paying for the bus, and some days I have to walk for over two hours just to get to and from uni. I can afford basic food with my loan, but a lot of the time, I’m not eating a balanced diet.”That’s why Peacock turned to the food bank that Leeds Beckett students’ union (LBSU) has set up to help struggling students. It has allowed her to stock up on basics like pasta and beans, freeing up more cash for fresh food.Tucked away discreetly next door to the student bar, the food bank is a small shop space adorned with fairy lights and shelves stacked with pasta, rice, tins of soup, chocolate biscuits and tampons. To the side are crates of fresh vegetables.Dotted around the shop are signs reading, poignantly, “Give or take”. The initiative is about encouraging students to donate, as much as it is about helping those in need, say the volunteers.With the coronavirus outbreak making students even more financially vulnerable, the service has become more important than ever, and the student union has increased the opening hours and organised to drop food packages at students’ homes to ensure all are provided for, even if they’re self-isolating. One of the main challenges is giving people the confidence to use it. “A lot of people are quite embarrassed to say they need help,” says Fozia Iqbal, one of the students who helps to run the service.Some do come in regularly, while for others it is a stop-gap. “One girl who came in told me that she needed something because she was getting paid tomorrow, and she needed to eat tonight. I thought, ‘Without this she probably would have gone hungry’.”Iqbal herself has only about £100 left each term after paying rent. Last year she juggled three part-time jobs while studying for her master’s in architecture, relying on the student union’s pay-as-you-feel soup kitchen on the run-up to payday.Jake Butler, a student finance expert from Save the Student, a student money advice site, says its latest accommodation survey shows the average maintenance loan now doesn’t cover the average student rent.According to the survey, published in February, the average student rent is now £126 a week (£6,552 a year), and £162 in London (£8,400 a year). The survey polled 2,168 students in December 2019 and January 2020.Students receive on average £540 a month in their maintenance loans, according to Save the Student’s calculations. With the average student rent working out at £547.82 a month, many students have little or no money left for food and other essentials.Jess Carrier, the welfare and community officer at LBSU, says the system doesn’t work for many students: “Even though it is supposedly means-tested, not everyone is supported by their family.”Peacock says: “My mum works seven days a week, so it’s not really fair of me to ask her because she’s struggling herself anyway. I don’t want to take her money off her.”The fact that students are turning to food banks at university is worrying, says Butler. “Unless the government does something about the maintenance loan, we could see university food banks opening up in more locations. The system is long overdue for reform.”Leeds Beckett isn’t the only university to start a food bank. Last year the University of Kent launched Stuff – a student food bank and freecycle scheme offering food and recycled homeware. Kent is planning to keep the service running throughout the coronavirus crisis.At Northumbria University, the students’ union has had to close its food bank service supplying food parcels, but has redirected all provisions to help self-isolating students.Staffordshire University student union has been running its Food Hub since 2014. In the last academic year the service was accessed 183 times, and numbers are set to increase in 2019-20, with more than 100 students having used the Food Hub so far. Like LBSU, they’re stocking up on provisions from wholesalers at the moment to ensure they have enough to keep students going.The students’ union recognises that even while avoiding the term “food bank” students still face stigma, and has started using food vouchers that allow students to get food at retail outlets on site.Connor Bayliss, president of Staffordshire University students’ union, says: “Sixty-five per cent of our students are local, many are mature or commute, and a high percentage of them are juggling caring or parental responsibilities and part-time work with their studies. Some students, such as those with children, are entitled to universal credit, and some have been “significantly affected” by the problems of its introduction, he says.Stoke-on-Trent, where it is based, is ranked as the 14th most deprived local authority area in England. “In some cases, support can mean providing enough food for their families.”Eve Crossan Jory, vice-president for welfare of the National Union of Students, says she is “appalled but unsurprised” at the increase in food banks. “Student maintenance funding is woefully inadequate, while rents are spiralling out of control. In one of the wealthiest societies, the fact that students and non-students alike need to access food banks is shameful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/165628e1275bc0590053dbdd0271e39ff195474f/0_0_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d03014ec7f1060e2ad1a185848bcbc24","title":"fright of her life gold coast woman finds five metre python on her doorstep","story":"Queensland snake catcher says 80kg albino Burmese python found in Oxenford is the largest he has come across in 27 years As a seasoned snake catcher, Tony Harrison is used to the people the claiming there is a five-metre snake on their doorstep. But for the first time on Monday, the caller wasn’t exaggerating.“This was the largest snake I have come across in 27 years,” Harrison said. “The poor old lady who opened the front door to see it there got the fright of her life”The giant albino Burmese python was found in the Gold Coast suburb of Oxenford.With the snake weighing more than 80kg, Harrison said it was lucky for him the reptile was good-tempered.“Burmese pythons are from overseas, so he is obviously someone’s illegal pet … he had been in captivity his entire life, he is used to being held.”But a missing tail and scars across its body suggested the snake had lived a rough life.Burmese pythons are an illegal species in Australia. They aren’t venomous but if they escape into the wild, as this one did, they can wreak havoc on the ecosystem.“It eats the food that our native species needs, in other words, competes with that native species, and there’s potential for introduction of viruses … a snake for America comes in and he can wipe out the Australian population,” Harrison said.After the massive snake was bagged, Harrison’s first call was to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to collect the illegal animal.The second was to his son Jensen’s school to make sure he got a chance to meet the impressive python.“When we pulled it out of the car he couldn’t believe it was real,” Harrison said.” This is the biggest snake you will come across.”Australia’s strict biosecurity laws mean that the python is likely to be put down.“It was a bit sad … to be playing with it and having it in the back of our car, knowing that that’s where it is going,” Harrison said. “Within an hour of catching it, it was in the back of a biosecurity car.”The maximum fine in Queensland for keeping a prohibited reptile like a Burmese python is $130,550."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdb4fd943ded225b3ad0c325932e355a7cbd7b3f/96_381_4098_2459/master/4098.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4e6fba11b3d93c9e7088b26d63a7660","title":"peregrine falcon drama at salisbury cathedral with a new egg and a lost bird","story":"A female peregrine has been spotted on a balcony nest, but Sally, star of Springwatch, hasn’t been seenThe rollercoaster saga of the Salisbury Cathedral peregrine falcons is continuing this spring, with one bird protecting an egg on a balcony of the great building but another missing in action.A female that has been visiting the balcony regularly in recent weeks has laid one egg and can be viewed hunkering down on the nest via a cathedral webcam.Less cheerfully, a GPS tracking device that was attached to a bird, known as Sally, that used to nest at the cathedral has stopped giving out its signal. It could be that the device has stopped working or that, sadly, Sally is no more.Phil Sheldrake, species recovery officer with the RSPB, said: “It’s great that we have an egg – and quite a bit earlier than last year.”The female on the nest does not have an identity ring, meaning that it is not known if she is the same one that produced four eggs last year, but Sheldrake said it was highly likely that it was the same bird.“Peregrines do not like to be overlooked,” he said. “Salisbury Cathedral sticks out like a sore thumb above the rolling countryside. It’s like a five-star hotel for them.”There are generally three or four eggs in a clutch and incubation doesn’t start until the last egg is laid. Once that has happened, the female – and male - will sit on the nest at intervals to keep eggs warm. Incubation lasts 29-32 days, so if all goes well, chicks should appear in early May.Meanwhile, the tracker attached to Sally, who became a television star after featuring on BBC’s Springwatch in 2017, last pinpointed her on 3 November 2019 above the village of Coombe Bissett, three miles from Salisbury – but no signal has been picked up since.Sheldrake said: “We don’t know if she’s alive or whether the tracker has simply stopped working. We haven’t seen her on the cameras at the cathedral and it’s quite possible the tracking device has just stopped working after nearly three years.“She is possibly 10 now, and whilst the oldest peregrine known was at least 24, the average life is around 10.” The tracker works on solar power, so if Sally has died it would probably not receive enough light to carry on working.Salisbury Cathedral has a historic bond with peregrines, which was broken in the 20th century because of persecution and pesticides. The first pair to breed in modern times arrived in 2014. The birds have done well there since then, apart from in 2018 when no eggs were laid following an unholy scrap between Sally and an unringed female."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a2dbd636cc68ed9344a5a137b413a4bf125135/313_245_1435_861/master/1435.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c53bbfef153a7068e574e129a2784b5","title":"us box office zero revenue first time ever coronavirus the invisible man","story":"Shutdown of cinemas hits film industry hard – but Onwards reportedly earns $71,000, mostly from drive-insThe US box office has recorded zero revenue for the first time in history after the country’s near total cinema shutdown in response to the coronavirus pandemic.Data agency Comscore did not issue their weekly report after Hollywood’s major distributors, led by Disney, declined to issue any figures.According to Comscore’s senior media analyst, Paul Dergarabedian, the only comparable occasion was in the immediate aftermath of the Northridge earthquake in 1994, which hampered collection of data, but its commercial effects were limited to California. With major chains such as Regal and AMC shutting down last week, the halting of cinema income is far more profound.Even so, some films are reporting revenue. The box office leader, according to Box Office Mojo, is the midlife-crisis comedy Phoenix, Oregon, which has taken $3,842 from 17 screens. However, this is the outcome of a streaming partnership with inidual cinemas, in which audiences can watch the film at home with a box-office split with a nominated venue. The film tweeted a tongue-in-cheek message congratulating itself on becoming the “lowest-grossing #1 film of all time”.According to Deadline, however, the latest DisneyPixar film Onward is playing at 135 locations and grossed $71,000, while horror film The Invisible Man has taken $64,000 from 111 venues.

In the first of a new series, one writer reveals the truth about their coronavirus viewing habitsLast week, the BFI released a list of the films streaming on Netflix and Amazon Prime. It’s terrific. It contains several movies I’ve always wanted to see (Adelheid, Images) and several I love and want to see again (The Green Ray, Orphée). The weekend was beckoning and the world appeared to be ending. I drafted a timetable of all the great films I would watch.Now it is Monday and the timetable is in ruins – which is to say that I didn’t watch a single film. What I watched was the BBC news, which is playing as a real-time adaptation of Stephen King’s novel, The Stand. What I watched was five episodes of the French sitcom Call My Agent, all of which I had seen before. What I watched was a Netflix documentary about a demented cowboy who ran a tiger park in Oklahoma. What I watched was the first half of The Wizard of Oz with my five-year-old son, just before he went to bed. Happily, he seems to have liked it saying: “The only thing I really, really hate are the songs.”Naturally, Covid-19 is partly to blame. If you take a random person who is exhausted, anxious and confused, and offer them a choice between watching a cherished classic from their childhood or the full seven hours of Béla Tarr’s Sátántangó, they’ll most likely plump for the least forbidding option. Even so, I suspect that our current predicament has merely accelerated a trend. I used to be altogether more adventurous in my viewing habits. In my 20s and 30s I’d always have gone for the Béla Tarr, if only to boast to people about how I was the sort of person who would always go for the Béla Tarr. Since then I’ve been backsliding, or maybe lightening up. And, as of this past fortnight, I’m a complete MOR sap. These days it’s as much as I can do to focus on anything that a) I haven’t already seen and b) comes in under two hours.What am I really watching? Mostly, I’m opting for the lowest form of escapism. As a kind of comfort blanket, I’ll watch YouTube videos of old celebrity interviews: John Lennon on Dick Cavett and Richard Burton on Parky.Occasionally I’ll watch antique tennis matches, too. Wilander versus McEnroe at the 1985 US Open. Becker versus Lendl at the 1988 Masters.Mostly these are matches I remember watching, live on telly, as a kid. Sometimes they are matches where I can remember which player hit which shot on which break point in the fifth set. Which makes it rather sad perhaps a little creepy, too. But you don’t need a psychiatrist to explain the appeal of these videos. There’s something reassuring about watching a drama unfold and knowing how it ends.Next weekend, fingers crossed, we’ll have another stab at the BFI list. But, for the time being, let’s not beat ourselves up about taking the low road, about choosing the trashiest option or the nostalgic frippery. Whatever gets you through the night, as John Lennon once said, possibly to Dick Cavett. Besides, Call My Agent is holding up nicely on the second viewing, and the tiger zoo documentary is perfectly entertaining. (Although, wait, how many episodes? Surely that’s stretching the whole thing very thin.) Plus there’s always the second half of The Wizard of Oz still to get through.In Preston Sturges’s Depression-era satire Sullivan’s Travels, a successful director of Hollywood comedies dreams of making a harsh, social-realist masterpiece only to realise that the world desperately needs to laugh, particularly when it’s laid out flat on its arse. That sounds about right it’s a solid thesis right now.So by all means watch dark, difficult films during dark, difficult times. But maybe balance them out with something lighter as well. I like the story of how, after Ingmar Bergman died, it was found that his film library contained VHS copies of Die Hard, The Blues Brothers and Romancing the Stone. I like it because it shows another side to the man, and perhaps points the way to a deeper psychological truth. Sometimes even Bergman needed a break from Bergman."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f743c9676c3f847df9d8f019852a67d7a68f36ab/37_0_2458_1476/master/2458.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcdc4f629488b5d8c2a3da04f4ad1c7e","title":"my favourite game canada v england womens world cup quarter final 2015","story":"Mark Sampson’s side beat the hosts and in so doing transformed the fortunes of the women’s game in EnglandPerfection can be likened to a flame it is possible to touch but very rarely hold. Almost five years ago Jodie Taylor, Lucy Bronze and their fellow Lionesses grasped it for just long enough to transform not only their own lives but the entire landscape of women’s football in England.The repercussions would prove so far-reaching that many of those of us present as extras – the journalists and fans in the background behind the central stage – can still feel Canada’s reassuringly strong late June sun beating down on our forearms during the walk to BC Place.The thermometer hit 25C (77F) as kick-off approached and Vancouver was arguably at its most beautiful. A long goal-kick away from the stadium, the Pacific Ocean looked azure and, dominating the skyline, the Rockies afforded the city a stunning frame.Even the shocking number of rough sleepers seemed, temporarily, to have vanished from the seedier streets.Outside the ground, the statue of Terry Fox, a famous Canadian athlete turned heroic cancer research fundraiser, was dressed in a familiar-looking outsize red-and-white-striped shirt emblazoned with the message “SAFC on tour”.It represented both a nod to the north-east-bred nucleus of the England squad, who had graduated from Sunderland Ladies, and a message to John Herdman, Canada’s charismatic Consett-born, Newcastle United-adoring manager. Collisions between globalism and parochialism rarely feel as joyous.Once inside BC Place, the first view of the brilliantly sun-washed pitch and stands packed with 54,000 fans, many waving red and white Canadian flags embossed with the maple leaf was breathtaking. In an instant, that national symbol morphed from merely an attractive image adorning the tailfins of Air Canada’s fleet to the source of an incredibly powerful patriotism being newly applied to the country’s female football team.The fiercely partisan noise was ear-splitting and the tension similarly tangible. The England manager, Mark Sampson, from a part of Cardiff with certain similarities to Consett, was good friends with Herdman. Bright young coaches, big on psychology and tactical intrigue, they shared a penchant for wearing tight white shirts and were nothing like as brash as they could sometimes seem.Publicly, though, it was very different. A gloriously edgy off-pitch preamble had seen Sampson demand refereeing protection against a side he termed the tournament’s “most aggressive”. Herdman told his players to “give England hell”.Jodie Taylor remained undaunted. Only nine weeks earlier the electric-heeled striker blessed with fabulously elusive movement had undergone knee surgery expected to sideline her for months but here she was seizing on Lauren Sesselman’s ghastly defensive mistake and surging towards goal. Taylor’s acceleration swept her past one marker and then another before she shot unerringly into a bottom corner.

Warning: you may cryIt only takes a fraction of a second, but a smile has the power to change everything. And that’s not just for those on the receiving end. According to a 2019 meta-analysis of data from more than 100 studies, smiling makes the person who’s doing it feel happier. From the flash of a grin by a stranger on the bus to the beam of a parent as their children stride through the door, even the most casual smiles have an emotional weight that we feel on an almost cellular level. Here, we chart the power of smiles, from birth to old age.My wife seemed to bond with our daughter immediately. I loved her from the off – I mean, it helped that she looked a lot like me – but it wasn’t in that overwhelming way that I’d hoped for.Mainly, I felt out of my depth. Our baby was so tiny, I was terrified of damaging her. I only got two weeks of paternity leave and because she was breastfeeding I wasn’t as hands-on as I’d hoped. In a way, I was jealous of the bond my wife had with her.But then, when my daughter was two months old, she smiled at me. I experienced this huge rush of love I remember thinking: “I’m your dad …” and it blew my mind. It was the first time I felt properly like a dad. I’m pretty sure I had a tear in my eye. Now our daughter is one and she smiles at me all the time. I still can’t really get over it. And I suppose it helps that she still looks a lot like me.The second time my best friend asked me to be her bridesmaid, I accepted with trepidation. She’d got engaged to her first partner very soon after they met, and afterwards she spent years dealing with the emotional fallout of the breakup.So when she met someone new, I cautioned her to take it slow. Within a few months, though, she announced their engagement. Though I was delighted that she was happy, I feared history would repeat itself.The wedding took a year to plan and my worry wouldn’t subside. I kept my distance from my friend’s new partner. A few times I tried to say that maybe they should slow down or postpone the wedding. “It’s different this time,” she said. But I could see my advice was bothering her.Eventually, I decided it wasn’t a good idea for me to be a bridesmaid. As the big day drew closer, the gap between us seemed to widen and I worried that I’d lost my best friend.The thing that finally convinced me that this time was different was seeing her smile as the marriage was made official. She was so obviously, radiantly happy. I burst into tears and ran to hug her and her new wife. Five years later, they’re more in love than ever and her partner has become one of my best friends too. I think of that as the smile that saved our friendship.Six years ago, I collapsed face first into the porcelain bathroom sink. My bottom teeth came clean (well, bloodily) through my lip. My top teeth splintered like ice on a frozen puddle. It turned out that I was haemorrhaging internally due to a duodenal ulcer it was so bad that I was in danger of a heart attack. An emergency surgery, two blood transfusions and five nights in hospital later, I’d pulled through.But what about the shrapnel formerly known as my teeth? For a few agonising weeks, I waited to find out if there was any hope of turning my stumps into anything even slightly approximating my old smile. “The teeth may die,” the dentist warned.I don’t recall that time very well, I think I was in shock. But I clearly remember the day that I finally got my teeth fixed. I looked in the mirror and felt so relieved to recognise myself again. That smile represented the end of an ordeal. It was the first time I realised how amazing it was that I’d survived.As a palliative care nurse, my patients are often unresponsive. It’s very hard for their families. “Do you think he heard me?” they ask. “Is it worth us talking to them?” The truth is, we can’t know for sure. But I also tell these families the story of how I ended up in my job.The day I decided to apply, I was caring for an elderly patient who’d been unresponsive. I chatted to him but he didn’t seem to hear me. Then his wife – they’d been married for about 60 years – came in and said: “Hello”. The moment he heard her, he smiled.I’ll never forget his amazing smile – I felt incredibly privileged to have witnessed that moment. I immediately put in a request to join the palliative care team and, four years later, I still absolutely love what I do.Read more at tepeuk"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/371e2e9e97c20b46d5f2e169c365d44bf353a1a9/4989_1431_6696_4019/master/6696.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8db95dd48512597d572aa913861f67f","title":"be toothful eight fascinating facts about smiling","story":" We smile when we feel good and we feel good when we grin even more.

What’s the secret to making you grin?From a big beam to the littlest lift at the corners of your mouth, smiling is infectious in the best possible way. Which is happy news, as new research shows smiling can really improve our mood, spurring a chemical reaction in our brains. As adults, we smile 20-40 times a day – finding joy in small moments that matter is as important as taking care of your teeth and gums. Here, six people share what makes them smile.Hazel Gardiner, 41, floral artist“My dog, Ringo, has made me smile from the moment we met. He was the puppy in a lively litter of goldendoodles who came straight over, desperate to be near me. Ringo is really loving but has some funny quirks. He’s not scared of lightning, but if he sees a luggage trolley he freaks out. He’s also a ball stealer at the park. He can hold three in his mouth, so you need an extra ball to get him to drop them. There have been times when I’ve walked him in the morning and been late for work because he won’t drop someone else’s ball. Now, we take five with us just in case. If I’m working on my laptop, Ringo will nudge my hand with his nose for a cuddle. I’m smiling just thinking about him. I’ve made it my mission to look after my teeth and, as a result, I’m a big smiler.”Sukhi Wahiwala, 45, small business coach“In the Sikh faith we believe that, at a certain point, the roles reverse and children look after their parents. Sadly, a year ago, my mother passed away. Helping my father deal with the loss after 65 years of marriage has been challenging, but positive too. My four children call him Papaji. Because we’re so close, each one of us has been able to be a part of my mum for him. I’m my father’s sounding board. I love listening to stories from his youth. We often talk about my mum’s encyclopedic knowledge and we laugh when I prompt him in the same way she would, bringing his memory back to life.”Nick Gaskell, 35, mortgage adviser“I’ve always struggled with my teeth. I have weak gums from lack of brushing as a child, and my two front teeth cross over. Now I pay serious attention to cleaning my teeth thoroughly and I smile with more confidence. And it shows when I’m doing what I love – gardening. My girlfriend and I recently bought a flat in a mansion block in north London, complete with an overgrown garden. Suddenly, I’m that person who watches gardening tutorials on YouTube, invests in fairy lights and visits the garden centre at the weekend. Now I look out of my kitchen window and see lavender, pieris and my favourite blue hydrangea. There’s a huge sense of achievement.”Christine Brown, 59, housing officer“My oldest daughter had lots of allergies as a child, so I’ve always made everything from scratch since then. Food is a big part of our family life. I find cooking very therapeutic, but there is no greater pleasure in the world than sitting down to eat with my family and seeing their faces light up.”Mariatu Turay-Akar, 42, owner of fashion brand Gitas Portal“I feel so fortunate that my marriage is still, after 20 years and five children, full of love and constant laughter. We’re playful together he makes me feel young. I often forget I’m in my 40s. Remembering when we met brings me joy – though, actually, I wasn’t interested at first. I assumed that we wouldn’t have much in common, but he turned out to be the most witty, charming man, and loves the theatre – just like I do. I smile most when I’m around him.”Keri Tebbit, 32, course development manager“When my four-year-old daughter first saw my braces, she said: ‘Wow!’ like they were the coolest thing ever.

We have a great dynamic and have always had amazing sex. I have a foot fetish and told her about it from the start. She is totally OK with it and we have incorporated it into our sex life here and there. I understand that it is new to her, but I wanted to try some more things with her slowly,  and I asked her if she can sometimes initiate. She has her own quirks and although I don’t quite like some of them, I let her do them anyway and sometimes initiate them because I know it brings her pleasure. But when I talked to her, she said that I made her feel inadequate by asking. She believes that there is no point because it would feel weird for both of us. But if she really liked me, wouldn’t she want to try to leave her comfort zone? Isn’t that what lovers are for?Every couple must navigate the ide between each other’s tastes and idiosyncrasies … and not only regarding sexual behaviour. It is part of the task of deepening bonds between you and learning the rules of compatibility. During this process, the style of negotiation can become more like a power struggle. One or both partners might start feeling coerced, ignored or frustrated. You are still at a trial and error stage. You have not yet discovered each other’s limits, or even your own. Try to be patient because this process always takes time. And it has to be OK for either of you to say: “I’m not comfortable with this.” You will find that your experimentation will sometimes be acceptable to your partner, and at other times you will be shut down. Fortunately, you seem to understand that there will probably have to be quid pro quo in terms of tolerating each other’s “quirks”, in your words – but it is important to remember that there is a fine line between doing something you find distasteful out of love or a sense of duty, and feeling coerced and resentful.

This legislation does not stop people losing their homes as a result of coronavirus, just gives them some extra time to pack their bags.”However, despite Jenrick’s statement that no renter would be forced out of their home, and the ensuring widespread belief that evictions had been banned, the official policy announced six days ago was that private tenants would not be evicted from their homes for at least three months.At the time, Jenrick also said: “Emergency legislation will be taken forward as an urgent priority so that landlords will not be able to start proceedings to evict tenants for at least a three-month period.”Advice groups called on the government to implement a stronger ban.Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “Simply extending notice periods to three months cannot be seen as ‘job done’. It means that people dealing with unimaginable financial uncertainty still face the prospect of being served with an eviction notice.“Over the coming days, the government must keep their promise and add to these changes to make sure no one loses the roof over their head as a result of coronavirus.”Tenants fear they will be left with huge debts, as they lose their jobs, are chased for arrears on rent, and then forced out of their homes with eviction notices.Caitlin Wilkinson of Generation Rent, said: “This legislation fails to deliver on these promises in every respect. All these measures do is extend the notice period for evictions to three months, which will provide little comfort to those faced with losing their homes in the midst of a pandemic.“Equally worrying is the lack of provision made for rent arrears, which will stack up in the three-month period. Many renters will end up with thousands of pounds worth of debt and no means of paying it off. Landlords and tenants are expected to ‘work together’ to find a solution to suit both parties from June onwards – but there’s absolutely nothing to stop landlords from evicting tenants if they can’t pay.” has sought comment from the Ministry of Housing,Communities \u0026amp Local Government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3f4aa6dcf1307aa2f7c6058bd123b68f2c086aa/0_4_2925_1756/master/2925.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1ed3505748523a50b7b4f5ebd0c7d22","title":"kim kardashian west accuses taylor swift of lying over leaked tape kanye","story":"Swift says footage of her infamous 2016 call with Kanye West exonerates her longstanding claim that he didn’t pre-warn her of the lyric: ‘I made that bitch famous’One of celebrity’s longest-running but assumed dormant feuds has once again reared its head. Kim Kardashian West has accused Taylor Swift of lying after the pop star claimed that newly leaked footage of her infamous 2016 phone call with Kanye West exonerated her longstanding claim that he did not tell her that he planned to rap “I made that bitch famous” about her on his 2016 single, Famous.That line does not appear in the 20-minute tape of the call – previously only seen in snippets leaked by Kardashian West in 2016 – in which West and Swift debate whether he should sing “I feel like Taylor Swift might owe me sex” or “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex”. After he repeats the lyrics, she expresses her relief: “I thought it was going to be like, ‘That stupid, dumb bitch’,” she tells West. “But it’s not.”In an Instagram story, Swift wrote: “Instead of answering those who are asking how I feel about the video footage that was leaked, proving that I was telling the truth the whole time about *that call* (you know, the one that was illegally recorded, that somebody edited and manipulated in order to frame me and put me, my family and fans through hell for 4 years)… SWIPE UP to see what really matters”. She then linked to WHO and Feeding America, and called on fans to join her in donating to them during the coronavirus pandemic.Kardashian West responded on her Instagram story accusing Swift of lying about West not calling to ask for permission. “The lie was never about the word ‘bitch’,” she claimed. “It was always whether there was a call or not and the tone of the conversation. I never edited the footage (another lie) – I only posted a few clips on Snapchat to make my point and the full video that recently leaked doesn’t change the narrative.”The semantic debate reveals Kardashian West and Swift’s differing interpretations of the intent of West’s call. Swift’s publicist, Tree Paine, responded by reposting the statement she released after West first released the song in 2016: “Kanye did not call for approval, but to ask Taylor to release his single Famous on her Twitter account. She declined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message. Taylor was never made aware of the actual lyric, ‘I made that bitch famous.’”Paine added: “PS who did you guys piss off to leak that video?”It is the latest instalment in a saga of Serial-length proportions: in 2009, West interrupted Swift’s acceptance speech for best female video at the MTV Video Music awards, saying that Beyoncé should have won for Single Ladies. The resulting outcry saw Barack Obama label West “a jackass”. By 2015, Swift and West appeared to have reconciled, and were pictured together at several awards ceremonies.In February 2016, West debuted the single Famous at a fashion show for his Yeezy label in advance of releasing his album, The Life of Pablo. It contained the lyric: “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex  Why? I made that bitch famous.” West claimed on Twitter that Swift had given the line her blessing.Later that week at the Grammy awards, Swift alluded to the situation when she collected the award for album of the year, for her 2015 record 1989: “I want to say to all the young women out there, there are going to be people along the way who are going to try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame.”In July 2016, West released a video for the song depicting him in bed alongside naked likenesses of many celebrities, including Swift. His wife, Kardashian West, then leaked snippets of footage recording a phone call between West and Swift in which she appeared to approve a lyric – albeit not ‘“I made that bitch famous” – and thanked him for giving her advance warning of the song’s existence.Swift responded in a since-deleted Instagram post: “Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was gong to call me ‘that bitch’ in his song? It doesn’t exist because it never happened … Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination.”Kardashian West insinuated that Swift was lying, which instigated a social media campaign against the singer. Swift has since said this period lead to a near breakdown and her withdrawal from public life between 2017 and 2019.In 2017, she released her sixth album, Reputation, which featured a number of songs that appeared to reference her feud with West. In the music video for lead single Look What You Made Me Do, she dressed up as prior incarnations of herself, including the outfit she wore to the 2009 MTV Video Music awards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f716bc709681be0483f727c50805e172a87f93dd/0_125_4454_2672/master/4454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96c305f658e10c7440fa1daa009c6bbb","title":"rihanna where to start in her back catalogue","story":"In Listener’s Digest, our writers help you explore the work of great pop musicians. As fans eagerly await the album known as R9, here’s a guide to pop superstar RihannaBy 2009, the idea of the “rebel album” – a record by a (typically female) pop star that aims for darker, more mature subject matter (see Janet Jackson’s Janet, or Christina Aguilera’s Stripped) – had become a bit passé. Rihanna, however, had more reason than most to want to refresh her creativity after a globally dissected violent assault by her then-boyfriend Chris Brown shifted her media narrative from pneumatic hitmaker to helpless victim. Rated R acts as the most glorious riposte to the latter notion, reasserting her control via rawer, more ragged music and imagery slathered in inky black molasses.Rihanna referred to the album’s creation as “therapeutic” and the opening suite of songs immediately defines one of her survival instincts: bullet-proof defiance. UK producers Chase \u0026amp Status concoct a menacing, dubstep-adjacent beat for the prowling Wait Your Turn, while the appropriately named Hard employs industrial-strength bravado (“brilliant, resilient, fan-mail from 27 million”) to paper over any cracks in her armour. As well as trying out different genres, from the aforementioned dabbles in dubstep to the excellent Fire Bomb’s 80s OTT rock balladry, Rated R also sees Rihanna sparring with more cliched masculine tropes. So the Slash-assisted Rockstar 101 finds her revelling in tortured genius territory, rolling lines like “sleep all day, long nights” around in her mouth with renewed relish, while G4L’s bass-heavy hip-hop peacocking features more natural charisma than an entire compilation of male rappers could muster.Still, Rihanna’s personal life bleeds into the morbid atmospherics of mid-tempo lead single Russian Roulette, specifically during the excellent, emotionally charged middle eight: “As my life flashes before my eyes, I’m wondering will I ever see another sunrise,” she sings with a previously unheard emotional connection. It crops up again on the twisted revenge fantasy of the chugging Fire Bomb. This being a Rihanna album, there are flashes of pure, escapist pop – the lascivious Rude Boy, the Latin-tinged love story Te Amo – but the ultimate takeaway is of a pop star who had previously been defined by other people – be it her early mentor Jay-Z, or more catastrophically, Brown – making a statement above and beyond the narrative being written for her. 2007’s Good Girl Gone Bad (and 2008’s equally hit-heavy Reloaded re-release) marked the point Rihanna morphed from radio-slaying popstar to fully blown pop culture-dominating megastar. Across both versions nine singles were released, from the globe-straddling, weather-altering Umbrella to the Ne-Yo co-penned ballad Take a Bow (both US and UK chart-toppers). Aside from the singles, including the Michael Jackson-sampling dancefloor behemoth Don’t Stop the Music, and the gothic-pop of Disturbia, the album constantly flexes its pop muscles, with album track highlights including the futuristic swirl of R\u0026ampB stomper Breakin’ Dishes, and the stop-start funk of the Timbaland-produced Lemme Get That.Following Rated R’s rough-hewn melancholia, 2010’s glossy Loud saw Rihanna return to the dance-orientated pop of old, scoring global smashes with Only Girl (In the World) and the lascivious S\u0026ampM. On 2011’s Talk That Talk, the dial goes up another notch, be it utilising EDM’s tension and release on the squelchy Where Have You Been and the incomparable, Calvin Harris-helmed banger We Found Love, or ing headlong into pure filth on the double whammy of Cockiness (Love It) and Birthday Cake (spoiler: she’s not talking about baking). There are flashes of Rihanna’s gift for revelling in a specific strand of tarnished euphoria too, specifically on the xx-sampling Drunk on Love.After the exhausted-sounding Unapologetic (2012), Rihanna took nearly four years to release its follow-up, Anti. The resulting album, featuring collaborations with the likes of SZA, Travis Scott and the Weeknd, jettisons EDM, big name dance producers, and Sia-assisted sky-scraping ballads in favour of hypnotic, soul-drenched interludes (James Joint, Higher), hip-hop workouts that wheeze as they slowly unfurl (Desperado, Woo) and, on the glorious Love on the Brain, a modern re-working of doo-wop that showcased not just the versatility of Rihanna’s voice, but her ability to infuse every second with pure emotion. The gloriously relaxed lead single Work also continued her streak for dictating the pop sound for the next three or four years.2015 was Rihanna’s year of experimentation, laying the groundwork for Anti’s arrival. Released after the folk hoedown of Four Five Seconds and the bowel-rupturing trap of Bitch Better Have My Money, the five minute mini-epic American Oxygen finds the Barbadian megastar musing, Bruce Springsteen-style, on the complex promises of the American dream. “Young girl hustlin’, on the other side of the ocean,” she sings over Alex Da Kid and Kanye West’s bass-heavy production, while what sounds like the swipes of helicopter blades whirr overhead.A very revealing conversation with Rihanna, by Miranda JulyIn which Miranda July gets a bit drunk and falls fully under Rihanna’s spell. In return, the Shut Up and Drive hitmaker talks Googling childbirth, fancying cultured men and revelling in exceeding people’s expectations.Up the Anti: how Rihanna rewrote the rules of pop, by Peter RobinsonA concise overview of how Rihanna – the most reliable hit machine in pop – employed her more impulsive flair for the botched build-up to Anti, and as a result set a new template for modern popstars to follow.Is Rihanna the most influential pop singer of the past decade? by Jayson GreeneAn interesting and persuasive piece that shines a light on Rihanna’s versatile voice, surely one of the best in modern pop.• What are your Rihanna favourites?

To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.The biggest confusion was over whether workers should count their jobs as essential, with construction workers, taxi drivers and tradespeople unsure. Some retail workers, such as staff at Sports Direct, were still called into their jobs by employers despite the order for non-essential retail to close. Sports Direct later changed its mind and said it was closing its stores.Gove said construction workers should still be going to work while staying two metres apart and tradespeople, such as plumbers and electricians, could attend emergencies in people’s homes.He said it was “unhelpful” and “wrong” for stores such as Sports Direct to remain open to sell sports and leisure wear, arguing that people generally had the appropriate clothing to go for a run or walk already.Non-essential shopping deliveries – such as clothes and toys – would be allowed to continue.Gove issued a series of stark warnings about the consequences of flouting the ban. Shown pictures on Sky News of construction workers gathering close together, he said: “Unless you stay at home, then the people you love most may die.”He said help for self-employed people would be outlined “later” by Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, because many of them were still packing on to public transport on Tuesday in the absence of financial support to compensate them for loss of their work.Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Staying at home means you should:You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u0026nbspNHS 111 coronavirus service\u0026nbspto find out what to do.There was also confusion over the movement of children of orced and separated parents, after contact between households was banned.Gove initially suggested contact would not be allowed but he later corrected himself, saying children under 18 would be permitted to move between the households of their separated parents.On different types of exercise, he said people would be allowed to run, walk or go to an allotment, but not to do more social activities, such as playing golf.Asked why Johnson had changed his mind and introduced more draconian restrictions, Gove told the BBC’s Today programme: “We are living in unprecedented times. All of us recognise this is a land of liberty but we are living in a national emergency.”Labour broadly welcomed the lockdown but some opposition politicians suggested it should go further.Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, said there had been a difference of opinion between him and the government, with City Hall pushing for construction sites to shut down.Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Labour leadership candidate and shadow business secretary, said people should not just be allowed to “order nice things online” that were not essential.“There needs to be a tightly defined list of essential workplaces,” she told the Today programme."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76f781b68064c31303c6c2d506f3f3d02d5f8c34/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff4b9ae9a454a029332683fe1e13d07d","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youCoronavirus infections around the world outside China have grown to more than 87,000, with more than 3,241 deaths.

Communities must not forget themCoronavirus has made enforced separation a universal experience, but there are additional and far-reaching challenges for learning disabled people and their families.I cannot visit my youngest sister, Raana, who has fragile X syndrome and lives in supported housing in Hampshire. My family has no idea when we will next see her.Social distancing, self-isolation and a lockdown for the over-70s will have a seismic impact on Raana (our parents are in their 70s, our father has a lung condition). My sister’s social contact is now limited to support workers paid to care for her and her learning disabled housemates. She uses text messaging but dislikes phone calls and writing letters.The past week has seen thousands joining community efforts to help older neighbours. We need similar attention on the UK’s 1.5 million learning disabled people. This is not because my sister’s disability makes her “vulnerable”, but because she is already among society’s most segregated people. The health inequalities experienced by people with learning disabilities are well documented, and research suggests learning disabled people are seven times as likely as their non-disabled peers to be lonely.Raana thrives on consistency and routine, including dance classes, baking workshops and weekly shopping. Yet coronavirus means services are closing and people’s movements are restricted. Online equivalents are not the same and do not always appeal if you have communication difficulties. What will happen if her trusted support staff fall ill or she has to self-isolate? What if she needs help with personal care?While necessary, the coronavirus bill has potentially devastating implications for people like Raana. Support may be restricted to meeting essential needs, and emergency volunteers could replace care staff. This raises concerns about safeguarding and care quality, and, as families, campaigners and care providers warn, the basic right to support may vanish.Learning Disability England has written to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, calling for the bill to be amended “to make sure the rights and entitlements of all disabled adults and children are not undermined”.Rhidian Hughes, chief executive of the Voluntary Organisations Disability Group, warns social care might temporarily become “purely functional”, instead of “support focused on outcomes that enables people to be healthy and maximises their choice and wellbeing”. It is clear that radical, short-term changes will have lasting negative repercussions.Given that people with learning disabilities get poorer care and die earlier than those without, what will happen if Raana herself falls ill? There have been concerns that critical care guidelines issued by the National Centre for Clinical Excellence (Nice) during Covid-19 might effectively make it harder for learning disabled people to get intensive care. Barrister and disability rights specialist, Steve Broach, has warned the guidance must be clarified.Even though my family admires and trusts my sister’s support staff, it is still unsettling to suddenly be physically distant. Clare Kassa, chief executive of the charity Sibs, which supports siblings of disabled people, and of which I am a trustee, says: “Siblings fill in so many gaps for services – like outings, breaks, family occasions. But also the more subtle ones like vigilance, keeping an eye, safeguarding. When you can’t be there, what happens? How do we siblings keep our brothers and sisters safe in such unprecedented times?”We are feeling our way as the current crisis puts further pressure on an already fragile support system and exacerbates the marginalisation experienced by people like Raana.Communicating clearly to my sister what the virus is is vital. Her support provider has been doing this and has protective equipment in place like masks and gloves as part of its contingency plan. Raana has been texting me “Hope all better soon” and asking about the kids, so she knows something is up.Inidual providers are creating their own guidelines on how to explain to a person with learning disabilities the importance of washing their hands – for example, using picture stories. Many easy-read and accessible resources have been produced in the past week by a variety of organisations.As a family, we are redoubling our efforts to stay in touch, by posting Raana more notes or cards, for as long as the mail service is reliable. My sister turns 31 in June and we always makes a big fuss of her birthday, with 10 of us gathering to celebrate, including the nephews and niece she dotes on. That is highly unlikely this year, which is distressing for us all.This week, Raana’s support workers are helping her to try out video calls. I hope it works, as this might just help us ride out what is going to be a long, fearful and lonely time not just for Raana, but for her loving family too.• Saba Salman is a journalist specialising in learning disabilities and editor of the Made Possible, a forthcoming book of essays written by learning disabled people"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50f429336adba3e0539c4092c095aed35ec42371/0_93_3464_2079/master/3464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=221f6a337382b2db2e94bdc5d2889065","title":"coco gauff grand slam title tennis prodigy","story":"Unscheduled season break could benefit a young player with the world at her feet – at just 16, a first major is hers to takeCoco Gauff’s career is idling along with those of all her locked-down rivals, but her mentor, Patrick Mouratoglou, who has guided Serena Williams to 10 of her 23 grand slams, thinks the American teenager can win a major whenever the tour resumes.“I can see Coco getting to a final and winning a grand slam,” he says, “and I feel she is not that far away.”That is a serious – if hardly impartial – vote of confidence in a 16-year-old who has risen from 685 in the world 15 months ago to 52 when the WTA suspended the women’s Tour this month because of coronavirus. Tennis is tentatively scheduled to return in June, although it is more likely to reappear much later than that.Mouratoglou has worked with Gauff at his academy in the south of France for six years but was as surprised as anyone when it took Simona Halep to stop her in the fourth round at Wimbledon last summer. Gauff was, at 15 years and three months, the youngest in the Open era to reach the main draw. Halep, in the form of her life, went on to crush his main client, Williams, in the final.The French coach was less shocked when Gauff made another impressive run at the Australian Open in January. She beat Venus Williams for the second time in the first round of a slam, then the defending title-holder, Naomi Osaka, before losing, again in the fourth round, to the tournament’s eventual champion, Sofia Kenin, her 21-year-old friend and compatriot.Mouratoglou is encouraged that Gauff is very much a work in progress. “The match against Sofia Kenin in Melbourne showed Coco needs to improve. Of course she does. She still plays at an incredible level and the self-belief she has is so strong that she can surprise and maybe win a grand slam. The Australian Open is gone, but why not another one?“Coco’s tennis is already big. She has a lot of things to her game a big serve, unbelievable backhand, she does a lot of things. She is able to come to the net. When it is a pressure point, she is able to go for it. She will also play a return volley to put pressure on her opponents.“She already understands a lot of things in tennis, but still it is not enough. There is still some space for her opponents to win the points.“Definitely there is still room for improvement. Her maturity is incredible at 16. That’s what stands out most for me. The ways she handles matches, it’s unique. But she is still only 16 and, when you are only 16, you still have so many things you need to improve, which is great.“The players she has beaten in the slams – Venus Williams, Naomi Osaka – and making the second week of a slam again after making the second week at Wimbledon, at that age, having so much to improve, it says so much about her as a person.”Gauff has won eight of 11 matches in three of the four grand slams and has placed herself alongside young contenders and champions such as Kenin, Osaka, the 19-year-old US Open champion Bianca Andreescu, Aryna Sabalenka, Elena Rybakina and Marketa Vondrousova.Gauff, along with her peers, can do little more than work on her game and fitness while the global halt to sport expands by the day. She had hopes of going to the Tokyo Olympics in July, but that door is closing by the hour. However, the unscheduled tennis break could benefit a young player who is still growing towards physical and emotional maturity at extraordinary pace in an unrelenting environment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ce0a49f008608766aa8a341e8f152c8c7094bbd/0_254_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9bfc6b929754671bb2cc11534afed49","title":"tokyo olympics to be postponed to 2021 due to coronavirus pandemic","story":"The Tokyo Olympics are to be postponed until 2021 after talks between Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and the International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach.“We agreed that a postponement would be the best way to ensure that the athletes are in peak condition when they compete and to guarantee the safety of the spectators,” Abe told reporters shortly after his conversation with Bach, adding that the Games would be held by the summer of 2021.The Games “must be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community”, the IOC and the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee said later in a joint statement.The Olympic Games and Paralympic Games will continue to be called the “Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020” even if they are held next year, and the Olympic flame will stay in Japan “as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times”.Until just a few days ago the IOC, along with the Tokyo organising committee and the Japanese government, had insisted there were no plans to delay the Olympics given they were not due to open for another four months but Japan’s NHK public television reported on Tuesday that Abe wanted the one-year delay.Tokyo 2020’s fate was in effect sealed this week when Canada and Australia said they would not send athletes to Japan in July, while the British and French governments urged the IOC to make a quick decision.The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said: “I know this is heartbreaking for so many people, athletes, coaches, staff and fans but this was absolutely the right call and everyone should follow their lead.”The US Olympic and Paralympic committee followed suit, citing the “enormous” disruption the pandemic had caused to training and the qualification process. A statement said: “Our most important conclusion from this broad athlete response is that even if the current significant health concerns could be alleviated by late summer, the enormous disruptions to the training environment, doping controls and qualification process can’t be overcome in a satisfactory manner.”World Athletics, the Olympic committees of Brazil, Slovenia and Germany, USA Swimming and USA Track and Field had joined the growing chorus of calls for a new date for the event.The head of health and safety for London 2012, Lawrence Waterman, had urged the IOC to postpone the Games for the first time in their 124-year modern history, saying they could not be held safely this year.“These Games need to be postponed, and the sooner the IOC and the Japanese government face up to this the better. It’s simply not safe to put the games on during a global pandemic,” Waterman said in a statement.“People’s safety and health should come before the costs of delaying contracts. The London Games were the first in history to be completed without a single fatality, we set the standard on health and safety at the Olympics.”The Olympics have never before been delayed, but were cancelled in 1916, 1940 and 1944 during the two world wars.Speculation that an announcement was imminent rose on Monday when the IOC member Dick Pound claimed the body had decided to postpone the Olympics for a year, describing it as the most likely solution to the Olympic movement’s biggest crisis since the politically motivated boycotts of Moscow in 1980 and Los Angeles four years later. “That’s my conclusion,” Pound told Reuters.Pound said the IOC had not rushed to an announcement so that it could present the Japanese hosts, sports federations and sponsors with a clear alternative plan. “Probably what turned the tide in the last couple of days is the curve on the Covid-19 virus. It is getting very, very steep now and this is clearly not something that is going to be under control by June or July and probably not by the end of the year,” he said.The postponement will come as a blow to the host country, which has spent more than $12bn on the event, while huge sums are also at stake for sponsors and broadcasters. Goldman Sachs estimated this month that Japan would lose $4.5bn (550bn yen) in inbound and domestic consumption in 2020 if the Olympics did not take place as planned.The Nikkei, a Japanese business daily, claimed on Monday that G7 leaders had agreed to a postponement during their teleconference last week, after Abe persuaded them that cancellation was not an option.Abe told the group that he was determined to hold the Games “in their complete form” – with the full quota of athletes and spectators – as a symbol of the world’s triumph over coronavirus, the Nikkei said. Boris Johnson reportedly responded with a thumbs-up, while other leaders nodded their approval.Abe this week hinted that postponement was a possibility, hours after the IOC said it could take up to four weeks to decide the fate of the Games. “If the IOC’s decision means it becomes impossible to hold the Olympics in their complete form, then a decision may have to be made to postpone them,” he told parliament on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d71ff30992ff5edfeb7b863e0b832418b3d2fe08/201_9_1939_1163/master/1939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88e8baf18bcafbe0a8ea60274cea974d","title":"joy of six one on ones","story":"Kanu, a Careca cracker and a 25-yard header from Diego Maradona feature in our list of memorable one-on-onesOne on one. Man to man. Those phrases suggest integrity, nobility even a bit of eye contact and generally doing things by the book, as men should. Not in football. In football the best one-on-ones are all about deception. You want honesty, go have a drop ball. A one-on-one offers scope for the simulation it’s OK to like. An attacker has all sorts of tools at his disposal. Stepovers and dragbacks dummies and shimmies sleight of foot, hip or eyes. Their weapons also include time – by taking the shot early or delaying it – and even the past, as Diego Maradona and Michael Thomas have shown.Yet the greater the attempted deception, the more copious the egg on your coupon if it goes wrong – as with a Panenka in a different type of one-on-one, from the penalty spot. You act like the king, you best not miss. This is why the best one-on-one finishers need something more than fast feet and a slow heartbeat. They need something that allows them to take such liberties with a football. It’s round, it has a circumference of 69cm, it weighs between 420 and 445 grammes – and that’s just the left one.Deception has been behind so many brilliant one-on-one finishes, including those by Alex Del Piero, Luis Figo, Ronaldo, Diego Maradona, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Claudio López and Peter Beardsley. All magnificent goals, but we particularly heart Davor Suker’s equaliser against Germany in the Euro 96 quarter-final, when he dragged his studs over the ball to completely befuddle Andreas Kopke. It was a masterpiece of arrogance, technique and imagination. Suker had already scored a memorable goal in the group stages, chipping the ball deliciously over Peter Schmeichel to complete Croatia’s 3-0 victory over Denmark. For two weeks in the summer of 1996, impressionable, delicate aesthetes all over England fell madly in love with him – principally for those two finishes and his attempt to lob Schmeichel from the halfway line.Croatia eventually lost 2-1 to Germany, but all anyone remembers from the game is Suker’s goal. These things matter. Had he simply passed the ball into the net against Denmark and Germany, Croatia’s first appearance at a major tournament would have been largely forgotten outside Zagreb and the immediate environs. Instead it’s still being talked about in list pieces 16 years later.In a sane and just world, all one-on-ones would involve an attempt to go round the goalkeeper*. Of all the options available to a striker it’s the most emphatic, brooking not a solitary argument. It’s also the most elegant, the most artistic and – we know how important this is to you, dear readers – the most cool. Increasingly, it’s also one of the most unusual. When Paolo Di Canio went past Raimond van der Gouw to score for West Ham against Manchester United, the BBC’s Barry Davies lamented the reluctance of players to do that any more – and that was 13 years ago.Our favourite example of a player going round the keeper comes from Italia 90. You don’t need Frank Carson to tell you that this was a Careca cracker. It’s not so much a goal as a free-form dance routine: so smooth and gracefully athletic that you can hear the samba beats as you watch it. It’s not just Careca’s movement that stands out. The angle at which he approaches the ball gives the Sweden keeper Thomas Ravelli no clue as to which way he might go – and Careca holds the moment between them for a few seconds with the certainty of a skilled seducer, maintaining eye contact. Then a sudden movement of the right foot, with no backlift, and the ball is whisked away. Now you see it, now you don’t. As Davies said simply: “Brilliantly done, brilliantly done.”It’s logical that Brazil, the home of inidual talent and unfettered expression, should produce so many good one-on-one finishers. But we’re not sure we’ll ever see one quite as slick as this again.* Or, rather, past the goalkeeper. He doesn’t really go round him, does he? Where does that expression come from anyway?The little book of clichés tells us Kanu has a good touch for a big man. But who needs a GTFABM when you don’t need to touch the ball at all? There have been a number of fine examples of players going past the keeper without applying leather to leather including George Best, Nicolas Anelka and Jesper Blomqvist. What we love about Kanu’s goal is the irresistible languor. Everything is done in slow motion, and he sits down keeper Jacques Songo’o almost with kindness. All those good touches for a big man filled Songo’o’s head with ideas of what Kanu might do to beat him. As a consequence, he didn’t have to do anything at all.* Blomqvist 1-0 Pelé, right? Well, sort of. It’s an amazing goal, and deserves to be more celebrated, but Pelé has inventor’s rights – and, just as importantly, his movement is a thing of the rarest athletic beauty. Blomqvist, by contrast, looks like he’s lumbering through a quagmire.Some people think a one-on-one is about scoring or saving a goal. These poor naïve souls probably leave their back door unlocked and believe in the good of mankind. For many attackers, the one-on-one is a power game. It is not enough to score a goal they must humiliate the goalkeeper too. In essence, it’s a masculinity-waving contest.Nobody waved their masculinity more often or more persuasively than Romario. If there has ever been a better one-on-one finisher, we haven’t seen him. Romario could manipulate the ball in a million different ways to get it over, under or either side of the goalkeeper. Watch this video of his one-on-one finishes and – as with the Diego Maradona YouTube game – try to predict what Romario is going to do with each one on one. No chance.The one thing you could predict is that he would try to dehydrate the keeper. When Barcelona went to Old Trafford in 1994, there was much talk about Romario v Peter Schmeichel, the world’s best striker v the world’s best goalkeeper. Romario did not just score with his only chance, he nutmegged Schmeichel as Schmeichel spread himself as wide as possible. Romario had hoisted Schmeichel by his own technique. It might have been a coincidence. It might.That had nothing on his goal against Uruguay a year earlier, when he made a complete clown of Roberto Siboldi. The context was a decisive World Cup qualifier. Had Brazil lost they would have failed to quality for the World Cup for the first time. So they recalled Romario, persona non grata for nine months and without a goal for four years. On a fraught night, Romario headed Brazil ahead in the 72nd minute, and with eight minutes to go he sealed their World Cup place.After running through on goal he knocked the ball past the advancing Siboldi to the right, shaped to go left and then suddenly veered away to the right again. Siboldi did not so much have twisted blood as twisted brain cells. He was so frazzled that, with the ball nowhere near, he ed forward full length and tried to punch Romario off balance. It was like a Benny Hill sketch. Romario evaded his attempt contemptuously and tapped the ball into the net. Of all his brilliant one-on-one finishes, none captures his raison d’etre quite like this.The one-on-one generally has a loose structure which, although informal, allows the striker to practice the skill in advance. There will be you, there will be a keeper, and you’ll have a few seconds to score. Yet sometimes the goalscoring opportunity comes in such unusual circumstances as that improvisation is the only option. With a nod to Jean Pierre-Papin, Mark Hughes, Leopoldo Luque, Lionel Messi, Roberto Baggio and Thierry Henry, we’ve gone for a nod of Diego Maradona’s head against Milan in 1988.Maradona loved vaccinating Milan at the best of times. They were Napoli’s main rivals in his time there, and he scored at home to them in each of his last five seasons in Serie A. This was the first meeting between the sides since Milan had taken Napoli’s title – effectively with a 3-2 victory on Napoli’s turf. Maradona’s goal set Napoli on the way to a cathartic 4-1 trouncing.Even the preamble to the goal is irresistible, with Maradona cracking the code of Milan’s offside trap, the thing that defined them. That will have given him almost as much pleasure as the finish. It’s an extraordinary goal, as 25-yard headers are wont to be. When the ball bounced Maradona probably planned to lob Giovanni Galli, but it had so much backspin that, instead, he strained his neck muscles like an angry Bruce Banner to get the ball over Galli and slowly into the net. Every gentle bounce of the ball goaded Milan and informed them, as if they didn’t already know: I have vaccinated you, again.This is the problem for any player who bursts past a high defensive line. But some goals are bigger than others, and thus, with a nod to Michael Thomas, one example stands out in this sphere: Jorge Burruchaga in the World Cup final of 1986. As he hared on to Diego Maradona’s pass with six minutes to go and the score at 2-2, Burruchaga had all the time in the world to consider the brutal reality of the moment. That, in the next few seconds his career – his life – would be defined: he would either be the man who won the World Cup, or the man who ballsed it up. (Argentina may well have gone on to win in extra-time, although they looked shattered and Maurice Mentum was emphatically with West Germany, who had come from 2-0 down to equalise moments earlier.) Immortality or infamy nothing in between. He took two touches and stabbed the ball coolly under Harald Schumacher.Some say Schumacher was slow off his line – having been burned earlier in the match when he came for a free-kick, missed and gave Argentina their opening goal – and that Burruchaga’s second touch was slightly too heavy. Yet that touch satisfied the golden rule of taking the last defender out of the game without bringing the goalkeeper into it. Any softer and Hans-Peter Briegel would probably have been able to attempt a slide tackle – and there are still around three yards between Burruchaga and Schumacher when he shoots, so an earlier Schumacher advance would probably have made no difference.Either way, who cares? It’s a one-on-one finish and it won the World Cup. The moment all small boys dream of. The fact it came in circumstances that most grown-up footballers might secretly dread makes it even better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2b895264f7a2499f8ed23ada204ce384c066253/0_81_2369_1422/master/2369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4500dc065251bd81efcc3f03f889912e","title":"the mandalorian review baby yoda has finally come to the uk was it worth the wait disney","story":"Disney+ has launched in Britain – bringing with it the first episodes of a live-action Star Wars series that follows the adventures of a bounty hunter in a galaxy far, far awayThere is one basic test that The Mandalorian – the biggest original TV series on the Disney+ launch roster – passes. It is cool. The monsters are cool, the spaceships are cool, the robots are cool. The landscapes: whoa. The interspecies bar fights: crackin’. This show was expensive – reportedly $15m (£12.9m) an episode. While that does not guarantee an uninterrupted stream of memeable zingers, based on the first two episodes, that is what Disney has got.In case you have been self-isolating on an arid moon, we are in the Star Wars universe here, located temporally between the last of the original trilogy, Return of the Jedi, and the first of JJ Abrams’ sequels, The Force Awakens. The atmosphere is thick the evil empire is only five years in the past. On the outer reaches of the galaxy, things are tense and lawless.We track the titular bounty hunter, who, like Boba Fett in The Empire Strikes Back, is hidden behind a helmet that reveals nothing of his face. That is the ceiling on the show’s appeal: Pedro Pascal, the lead actor, is limited to dialogue and movement. The Mandalorian, show and character, is not especially charming. But Pascal is playing an emotionally ascetic mercenary. The show is not meant to be charming. It is meant to be cool.In any event, two things are established by a lithe preamble in which the Mandalorian despatches a whole saloon full of miscreants in order to capture a chatty blue creature he has been paid to arrest. First, this is a western. Second, Pascal can do a fair bit with dialogue and movement. He is a badass, for sure, but he is also cynical and purposeful, with a weary wit. He is Robocop. He is Clint Eastwood. He is Ryan Gosling in Drive. He is not messing about and neither is the series, as an over-the-odds, off-the-books job takes our man to a secret bunker crawling with black-and-white stormtroopers, which feels like walking into an underground club in 50s Paris and finding it full of uniformed Nazis. Also in there is … Werner Herzog!The casting of Herzog as the Client, an imperious – and indeed imperial – iceman for whom you do not want to be working, announces that The Mandalorian is not afraid to take a gamble, high-stakes though every creative decision under the Star Wars banner is. It is the first of a run of wins, as Herzog’s lethal eccentric is replaced as the Mandalorian’s foil by Nick Nolte as the voice of dignified, jowly vapour farmer Kuiil, a survivor of the empire’s jackboot. His catchphrase – “I have spoken” – lends him the air of a septuagenarian history teacher who effortlessly keeps command of the class. Then Nolte hands the baton to Taika Waititi as IG-11, a leggy pedant of a droid whose hips can rotate through 360 degrees and who keeps threatening to self-destruct when he and Mandy get into a Butch Cassidy predicament.All this is the work of the writer and showrunner Jon Favreau, who was Monica’s cage-fighting boyfriend in Friends and the guy from Swingers and Chef, but who is somehow also the director of Iron Man, Iron Man 2 and the remakes of The Jungle Book and The Lion King. In other words, he knows how to helm an entertainment mothership reliably, but is not so afraid of breaking it that he can’t mess around. As a result, you can’t tell whether a sly joke or a colossal set piece is incoming, but you know whichever it is will be effective.The Mandalorian’s best creation, and the twist at the end of episode one, preceded it on social media (since Disney+, and this show, launched in the US in November). The Child, immediately given the obvious moniker Baby Yoda by fans, turns out to be the illicit quarry on which the whole series will turn. Our pal the bounty hunter has to look after a tiny, excessively cute 50-year-old infant (species age at different rates, don’t-cha-know), whose floating crib is another example of Favreau using groundbreaking effects technology to come up with something simple but profoundly satisfying.In episode two, which is given over entirely to the Mandalorian extricating himself from a gaggle of annoying, thieving Jawas, we see a little of what an adorable, large-eared toddler version of Yoda is capable of, as the Force rejoins us and we return to familiar Star Wars folklore. But that is a crutch the show has the confidence to regularly toss aside.The ideal TV spin-off should bow to the franchise that bore it, then strut off on its own without looking too fretful about whether the die-hards follow. In this case, they surely will: The Mandalorian is too cool to resist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfe967110a57bbbf4ccc2c54a3577472569a10c5/0_117_2509_1506/master/2509.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46cc47f92ba6a620b777e01ebfeda486","title":"to the maxxx the handmaids tale star o t fagbenle on his gloriously daft new comedy","story":"The versatile British actor on subverting stereotypes, his loud musical family, and flirting with Scarlett Johansson in a new Marvel filmO-T Fagbenle is on his knees in a bloodied toga, singing a cappella and begging Jourdan Dunn for one more chance. The supermodel looks wholly nonplussed, so Fagbenle – playing the eponymous deluded narcissist in the new E4 comedy Maxxx – sweeps out imperiously, only to creep back to tug the trailing toga fabric free from the door.Comparing Maxxx with Fagbenle’s best-known role in The Handmaid’s Tale, where he plays June’s (Elisabeth Moss) husband Luke Bankole, offers a fine illustration of the actor’s versatility: the gentle, measured Luke, risking his life to try to save his wife and child, could hardly be further from the self-absorbed clown that is Maxxx. But Fagbenle has been quietly doing eye-catching work for years on both sides of the Atlantic, notably in Looking, Andrew Haigh’s underseen HBO drama about gay life in San Francisco, and the BBC’s fine Zadie Smith adaptation NW, as well as lead roles in thrillers including Sky One’s The Five and BBC One’s The Interceptor. You will have seen him in something, just nothing like this.Once one-third of the fictional boyband Boytown (signature hit: Can I See Your ID?), Maxxx is now a bankrupt, pill-popping joke, getting bottled off at nightclub PAs. His desperation to win back Dunn (gamely playing herself) drives him to plot an unlikely professional comeback. What ensues is a wincingly funny portrait of a man prepared to do anything and everything in order to clamber back up to the stars. It is a mordant, unhinged and probably pretty accurate depiction of life on the margins of celebrity.You certainly have to when the show is one you are writing, co-directing and headlining. Fagbenle’s brother Luti, whose music videos for Drake, Jay-Z, Beyoncé and more have had more than 4.5bn YouTube views, is exec-producing. Their fraternal dynamic feels, aptly enough, like Bros gone right: respectful, self-aware, rooted in genuine talent. Even months later, when Fagbenle arrives at Channel 4’s HQ looking a legitimate star in tailored check suit, suede shoes and fedora, his relaxed demeanour belies a relentless work rate: “I landed at 2am, was up at eight to record the Maxxx theme tune at my brother Rockwell’s studio … But I have all the problems I’ve asked for.”Maxxx’s problems are more severe. He cuts a tragic, even sympathetic figure because, Fagbenle feels, his aspirations hit close to home. “We all know people who think ‘likes’ represent genuine popularity. Those ideas of presentation versus reality, of chasing the one thing you think will give you meaning when it does the opposite, fascinate me.”So should Fagbenle prepare for a backlash from Brosettes, Directioners or the BTS Army? “Hand on heart, it’s not based on any particular pop star,” he laughs. “If anything it’s more my own failings and insecurities, those times where I’ve chased vacuous things or felt depressed because I didn’t feel valued. Ambition can make you do and say crazy stuff. And I’ve got hung up for way too long on a couple of bad break-ups. Basically, I looked at all the ways I’m a fucking idiot and wrote about that.” Fagbenle is no one’s idea of an idiot: engaged, opinionated, casually referencing Walt Whitman, Abraham Maslow and Steven Pinker in his answers. But ambitious? Absolutely.The fourth of 12 children, O-T (short for Olatunde) had to make himself heard. His siblings include TV producer Luti, music producer Rockwell XL, singer Tito, women’s basketball star and Olympian Temi, and Daps, who has directed videos for artists including Migos and Stormzy … Even those out of the public eye are singers and dancers on the quiet. It must have been a noisy household, I suggest. He shows me a video of his recent birthday gathering: “It is,” he cackles, “a lot.”Already an accomplished alto saxophonist, the 18-year-old Fagbenle did lighting for a school play and decided that day to audition for drama school. Although few teenagers – and even fewer BAME candidates – were accepted back then, he got into Rada where, sure enough, he was the only black person in his year. It’s a professional experience he has got used to: “Every time I go on set I play Spot The Black Person.” His first acting job saw him asked to “whiten up” in order to accentuate the blackness of his on-stage brother against his own mixed-race ethnicity. The reason given? “Up north they might not be able to tell the difference! My first job,” he says in disbelief. “I was panicking about representing a false idea of the truth to fit with someone’s stereotypical understanding. I’ve had a number of experiences like that.”The sort of experience that could have derailed a young actor instead hardened his resolve to make it his way. After building a steady career on screen and stage (his performances in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom at the National Theatre and Trevor Nunn’s production of Porgy and Bess were particularly acclaimed), he decided to realise a long-held ambition to direct. A few short films followed, but more substantial material proved harder to come by, so instead he wrote something himself, working on Maxxx’s scripts with improv comedians in Toronto while filming The Handmaid’s Tale.Fagbenle feels that the show has largely addressed accusations of gratuitous violence that circulated after a brutal second season. But its repurposing of slave narratives for the predominantly white women of Gilead, and not entirely convincing presentation of a colourblind world, remains troubling for many. “There’s work to be done,” he admits, “but there’s been a ersification behind the camera which there wasn’t earlier on, with black writers and black directors. If they continue to challenge themselves to do that, they’ll be over the humps.”Fagbenle also pushed to make Maxxx as erse as possible on- and off-screen, interviewing widely for cast and crew. “I don’t need to give anyone a leg-up, I just have to make sure they get in the interview room when you do that, you find talent. If you just say: ‘We should make sure we get some black people in,’ nothing will happen.”One fascinating exchange on the show sees Maxxx’s strait-laced black manager Tamzin (played by Pippa Bennett Warner) refuting the idea she might be “urban”. “It’s a really interesting question I wrestle with all the time,” says Fagbenle. “Is black a colour, a culture? Can a white person be urban? I wanted Maxxx to be funny but also explore philosophical things. And to have two love interests who are darker-skinned black women you don’t see that so often.”It has also allowed Fagbenle to overturn a different sort of expectation, acquired over years in British TV. “I became the professional boyfriend or husband,” he sighs. “Lazy thinking. Different opportunities exist in theatre, but there’s still a dearth of big, expansive characters for minorities and for women on screen. I trained classically for the most exciting texts known to man, and then you get the ‘charming guy in the bar’. Where’s the complexity? I wanted to write a role no one would cast me in: the maniacal egomaniac.”His next project would have Maxxx drooling: playing agent Rick Mason – an ally from Scarlett Johansson’s character’s past – in Marvel’s Black Widow. “But we flirt, too,” he adds. “The fan scrutiny hasn’t been too crazy, although my poster hasn’t been released yet so we’ll see how that goes.”My poster hasn’t been released yet? He laughs hysterically. “I’m really not someone who fantasises about being more famous, I’m not like Maxxx! Although maybe we all are to an extent I hope this speaks to the narcissistic, egomaniacal and unnecessarily long-winded fool in all of us.”Maxxx starts Thursday 2 April, 9.30pm, E4. All episodes will be available afterwards on All 4"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a35205e6fcea5c72a96f59aebfad1ea48245bb1e/0_42_1935_1161/master/1935.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=653f8aaa62a7d6f9b21cb7e4ab6fc74d","title":"where to get your soapy fix when eastenders goes off air","story":"The great British soap is going on hold. But if you’re pining for the fake deaths, awful lotharios or businesses that could never exist in the real world, there are alternative shows out thereThe news that EastEnders and other BBC soaps (namely the hospital ones: Doctors, Casualty, Holby City) have paused filming may be little more than a footnote in the history books when we look back upon this pandemic. But we – the die-hard EastEnders fans who are nurtured by its philanderous plotlines and the ill-fitting knitwear of Ian Beale – will for ever remember.If now more than ever you need the distraction of an unrealistically well-stocked Minute Mart and the only caff in east London that does not sell flat whites, we have got you covered. True, there is only one EastEnders, but with some careful curation, you can get your fix of soap-tropes elsewhere.Death is an integral part of EastEnders an outlandish or surprising death has become central to many of its special episodes (nothing says Christmas like a beloved character dying). Accidental deaths, deaths where someone gets their comeuppance – deaths from illness, murder, manslaughter, falling off a cliff (Janine and Barry, 2003) – you name it, they have covered it. But its piece-de-resistance death is the false death, usually one intentionally faked.If you’re looking for an elaborately faked death (and I don’t just mean the simple “are they dead or not?” plot device or cliffhanger) you have plenty of shows to choose from. There is Orphan Black (Netflix, BBC America), Homeland (Amazon Prime), Pretty Little Liars (Netflix) and, of course, Game of Thrones (Now TV), which, for a show that isn’t a soap, is dominated by feuding families and unwanted pregnancies.For spoiler reasons I can’t tell you the details of these fake death, but they are abundant in many shows. Hint: you can even find them in comedies (see: Community, 4oD).The recurring EastEnders character Max Branning is the perfect example of a guy who somehow gets credit for doing the bare minimum in family and friendship. We are primed as viewers to feel sympathy for him on the rare occasions he is not conning, sleazing or flogging dodgy cars – yet he continues to punch above his weight with the (often much younger) women of EastEnders.What is it about this human baked bean that is so irresistible to women? It might be one of the soaps’ most unrealistic bits of writing (and they once had a vicar who murdered people), but it sure as hell makes for irresistible watching. If you get a thrill out of the love tangles of the truly awful, why not kick things off with a Woody Allen movie before binge watching Curb Your Enthusiasm (NowTV) Big Bang Theory (a classic in the “nerd gets hot girl” theme, Netflix) or Modern Family (includes older monosyllabic bore with beautiful young wife, Amazon Prime). Don’t worry, all of these shows poke fun at this awful trope.Recent watchers of EastEnders will notice that Whitney Dean has joined the long lineage of characters who have spent time in prison. Crime and policing features heavily on the show, delivering closure to storylines or opening up new ones focused on miscarriages of justice.If you need your prison fix, you could do much worse than Orange is the New Black (Netflix), the ensemble prison show set in a women’s prison. For something more serious try Locked Up (Netflix), a much darker Spanish drama once more looking at women’s prison. And there are plenty of excellent documentaries to choose from: Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons (Netflix) is a series hosted by Raphael Rowe, who spent 12 years wrongfully locked up, and far surpasses similar offerings fronted by EastEnders hard man Ross Kemp.And while no police officer could be quite as incompetent as DCI Marsden – the EastEnders detective who after 20 years still cannot catch Phil Mitchell and has yet to launch an investigation into why so many Albert Square dead people aren’t actually deceased – there are a number of bingeable series that deal with ongoing police grudges and incompetence. See Making a Murderer (Netflix) and Keeping Faith (BBC).Eastenders loves a mystery – mainly of the whodunnit variety, although parentage questions always thrill (see the now iconic “You aint’ my muvva”  “Yes I am!” moment between Kat and Zoe Slater in 2001). But there is one more recurring mystery: how do any of the market traders manage to afford London rent?Idealised small businesses are a common theme of television shows (Fleabag riffed beautifully off this with its eye-watering pricing in the cafe) and EastEnders is one of the worst. It has tried in recent years to better reflect reality: it is now more than £6 for a bacon bap and a cup of tea in the caff the Queen Vic has finally conceded it needs to sell food Kim realised she would make more money selling the B\u0026ampB as a property then she ever could running it.Family Business (Netflix), a comedy-drama from France, follows a Parisian family attempting to transform its failing kosher butcher into a legal weed cafe cult comedy Schitt’s Creek (Netflix) follows a wealthy family forced into financial ruin and exile to a backwater US town, where they run a motel. The drama Bloodline (Netflix) follows a Florida resort and, like EastEnders, is full of lies and festering family traumas. Then there is the animated series Bob’s Burgers (Amazon Prime), set in a burger joint, while for something altogether surreal there’s SpongeBob SquarePants. It features the Krusty Krab, a diner under the sea that inspired a real restaurant in Ramallah, on the West Bank.For all the stick that EastEnders gets, it continues to attract millions of viewers across the nation, cutting across demographics and breaking through cultural silos. Many storylines are fearless in tackling difficult or sensitive topics, introducing wholly new perspectives to groups who might otherwise not come across them. There has been a trans character, a convert to Islam, characters on zero-hour contracts and families dealing with knife crime, police harassment and the threat of homelessness. Other plotlines explore consent, mental health and euthanasia. Crucially, it is one of the few shows that has characters who are hard up for cash. If you are skint, you are often invisible in Britain, despite struggling for money being a reality for many, many peoplein the country.If you are interested in shows that deal with the lives of marginal groups, there’s Pose (BBC), which looks at the New York ballroom scene and features the largest ever cast of trans actors My Mad Fat Diary (4oD), which tackles body image and depression Top Boy (Netflix), which looks at drug dealing and gang feuds and Sex Education (Netflix), a joyful exploration of sexual identity well beyond heterosexuality.But, if you want to see portrayals of how Britain’s working poor are living today, you will have to settle for the news."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7de25808f4f05d18290438737938409c086191f7/0_155_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa068e2cdf84fc6ca66f8d315cb50fdc","title":"have i already had covid19 coronavirus","story":"Covid-19 symptoms, when they occur, vary widely and undertesting means many people have probably been unwittingly infectedCovid-19 symptoms vary widely, and undertesting in many countries means that many people may have already had the coronavirus without having received a positive diagnosis. Is it possible to find out, and how should you behave if you think you may have been infected? Dr William Hillmann: At this point, we don’t have a test to tell that. We are developing antibody tests to check for a prior infection, but those aren’t ready for clinical use yet. The only definitive way to know that you’ve had it is to get tested while you have it and to have that test be positive.Hillmann: Coronavirus is actually quite a significant spectrum of symptoms, from people who are entirely asymptomatic and would have no idea that they have it to people with very mild, cold-like symptoms – runny nose, congestion, sore throat – to people with more flu-like symptoms – high fevers, muscle aches, shortness of breath and cough. All the way up to people with severe illness, who we’re seeing in the hospital with respiratory failure, requiring ICU care. (Editor’s note: recent reports  suggest that loss of smell and taste are also signs of Covid-19 infection.)When people are symptomatic, they’re contagious. A day or two before they become symptomatic, they’re likely contagious as well. A virus builds up and starts to shed, and then after symptoms resolve, people can still be contagious for a couple of days. We have some evidence of viral shed even a couple of weeks after symptoms are resolved. It’s hard to know if that’s actual live virus, which is still able to infect somebody, or if that’s just dead virus that the body is shedding.Buchholz: We all have to be role models. If we’re all in it together, we all should be doing social distancing.Hillmann: Since there’s no real way to know at this point who might have had it, unless you’re symptomatic, you get a swab and are definitively diagnosed with it, I would just act as if you hadn’t had it. Keep doing all of those things that we all should be doing at this point: social distancing and hand hygiene.Buchholz: I would, absolutely. I’m in New York, and it was definitely in the community before we knew it. So, yeah, any family members and close friends, maybe somebody you work next to, I think I would just alert them, especially if it was in the last 14 days. If it’s been more than 14 days, they would have gotten sick by now if they had significant exposure.Hillmann: It’s up to every inidual about what they feel is right. If somebody is diagnosed with a case of coronavirus, I might feel a little bit more strongly that they should tell people because if you’re in close contact with a healthcare worker, it could have implications for precautions that healthcare worker needs to take.Buchholz: There’s not been any evidence that anyone’s gotten it more than once. Someone with a normal immune system that can react to the virus and get better should have immunity for quite some time, at least a year, if not lifelong.Dr David Buchholz, senior founding medical director, primary care, assistant professor of pediatrics, Columbia University Irving medical centerDr William Hillmann, associate inpatient physician director at Massachusetts general hospital"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4f32d8900f9fee142a9b0a05b1fb49735150d9d/0_302_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=236131e96309656f76c20ab7907f7993","title":"coronavirus the guardians promise to our readers","story":"Together we can find a way through this crisis, providing accurate and insightful reporting and listening to you, our readersThank you very much for your commitment to the .

That is a major concern for Hernando Enrique Mattos Dager, the rear admiral in charge of the Colombia’s Poseidon taskforce against drug traffickingThe rudimentary submarines, fashioned in secret workshops deep in the mangrove swamps of north-western Pacific coast, are notoriously difficult for navy patrols or radar to detect. They cruise “flush with the surface of the water, and the part that protrudes above the surface is very small,” Dager said.For all their recent success, Dager and his taskforce know that they have probably only encountered the tip of the iceberg. As with all interceptions of illicit drugs, the feeling once the initial euphoria subsides is that many more get through than are ever detected. The authorities seized 433 tonnes of cocaine in 2019, more than half by the navy, but production was estimated to be more than 1,000 tonnes.In November, a 22-metre semi-submersible vessel was intercepted on the other side of the Atlantic, off Spain’s Galician coast. It was carrying around three tonnes of cocaine, and two of its three crew members were reportedly from Ecuador.Evidence of the successes of Dager’s taskforce is littered among the mangrove roots around its base in the south-western port of Tumaco. The town is situated just north of the border with Ecuador in Nariño department, which has more land under coca cultivation than anywhere else in the country. It accounted for about a quarter of the 169,000 hectares (417,600 acres) under cultivation nationwide in 2018. Tumaco is known as “the pearl of the Pacific” for its stunning beaches, but it has also become a flashpoint in Colombia’s long fight against drug trafficking.Painted in blue, grey and pastel greens, the submarines’ fibreglass hulls appear to have more in common with Jules Verne’s Nautilus in his 19th-century novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea than a sophisticated seagoing submersible. But these low-profile boats are designed to take to the sea with their decks awash, carrying their cargo just beneath the waves and out of sight.Rumours that the cartels were using submarines began in the 1990s, and in 2006 the navy intercepted one off Costa Rica with 3.5 tonnes of cocaine on board.The cramped submarines are crewed by between two and four men, usually recruited from local fishing communities, often in Ecuador. If naval patrols discover them, the crew members “open valves to let in water and sink the vessel, sinking the evidence,” before jumping into the water, said Captain Victor Santos Pacheco, commander of the local coastguard, which often rescues crews from the sea.The vessels can reach Central America in two or three days. Those that head further north to the Mexican or US coast are replenished at sea with water, food and fuel, indicating elaborate logistics. Crew members can earn up to $50,000 (£43,000) for a long crossing, but see it as a risk worth taking, according to officials. “A kilo of cocaine is worth $30,000 on the streets of New York,” said Dager.The taskforce has recently seen evidence of an increase in the use of submarines to transport marijuana. “It could correspond to the fact that its consumption has been authorised in some countries,” said Dager. “This has opened up an interesting international market ... The production of marijuana in Colombia is very economical ... at $100 a kilo, and it sells for up to $7,000 in the US.”The cartels are constantly upping the ante in a cat-and-mouse game on the high seas. They are now using winged torpedo-like tubes known as “parasites” that are fixed to thehulls of large ships, Pacheco said. They also have a new tactic – a GPS-equipped “buoyed cargo” designed for clandestine recovery at sea.“Narco-trafficking is innovative. It never stops,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/883780f5e17542dd87d86f32e628f371acbf2977/275_66_3039_1823/master/3039.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89a2b6e8cd24b2d1353b5ac5132c2601","title":"how is your university supporting you during the coronavirus pandemic","story":"If you are a university student we want to hear how your institution is supporting you Students at Oxford and Cambridge will have their summer exams replaced with online assessments due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Under the terms explained by Boris Johnson in his TV address, people will be allowed to leave home only for the following reasons:Meeting friends, shopping for anything beyond essentials, and gathering in crowds are now banned.Police will be able to enforce the rules, and impose fines on people who do not abide by them. Authorities will force the closure of all shops selling non-essential goods, including hair and nail salons, and all markets apart from food markets. Also closed will be libraries, outdoor gyms and playgrounds, and churches or other places of worship. Hotels, B\u0026ampBs, campsites and caravan parks will also be closed, apart from to permanent residents or key workers. All public gatherings of more than two people will be banned, except if those people share a household. Also prohibited are all social events such as weddings and baptisms, although funerals will be permitted to take place.At least three weeks. Johnson said that after that point, the government will relax the rules “if the evidence shows we are able to” – but this is by no means certain.The hope is to severely limit the scale of physical and social interaction, and thus slow the spread of the coronavirus so that the growth in cases does not overwhelm the NHS and lead to mass deaths. As Johnson put it: “Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope.”This remains to be seen – and given the time lag between infections and people becoming critically ill, it will be up to two weeks before any benefits are realised. On Monday, Italy recorded a slight reduction in the number of coronavirus deaths, two weeks after it introduced a national lockdown. So the UK can expect an exponential growth in infections and deaths first, before – hopefully – the curve flattens.There has been a gradual increase in restrictions, going from ministers urging people to work from home if possible and avoid pubs and other crowded places, to schools and nurseries being closed, and then on Friday the forced closure of pubs, clubs, restaurants, gyms and other communal businesses. However, the information on physical distancing has thus far been framed as advice, with Johnson stressing the desire of people to be out of doors.Opposition parties and, increasingly, some Conservative MPs have been pushing for tougher restrictions on people’s movement, especially following much-shared photos over the weekend of crowds in national parks and elsewhere. Speaking in the Commons on Monday, the former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said: “We must move to lockdown rules now that ban non-essential travel. It’s time not just to ask people to do social distancing, but enforce social distancing rules.”Many other European countries have taken a lockdown approach, generally a week or so before the UK. Italy saw a ban on almost all movement in the north of the country which was extended, and then intensified, with only a selection of vital shops and businesses allowed to open, and police checking on people’s movements. Spain and France have taken similar measures.The most extreme approach was taken in China, where authorities essentially sealed off 11 million people in Wuhan, where the virus first began spreading, before extending the quarantine zone to take in more than 50 million people. People were kept in apartment blocks, with visitors and almost all outside movements banned. Other measures included compulsory temperature tests, and the placing of those feared to be ill in isolation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1b59181ab6ef3418471f43ff5e0d3e186ca6932/0_21_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c21e46e39a0b96a6cc037abcd1fb9748","title":"australian pm says stay at home as coronavirus shuts down large sections of economy and social life","story":"Prime minister Scott Morrison announces real estate auctions, beauty parlours, weddings and funerals hit by new rules as most overseas travel bannedLarge sections of the Australian economy and social life will be shut down from midnight on Wednesday, after the national cabinet agreed to a range of further restrictions on indoor and outdoor gatherings in addition to a ban on non-essential overseas travel to combat the Covid-19 outbreak.But despite the range of further restrictions, Scott Morrison said the national cabinet would not “just rush on the sense of an opinion of inevitability” towards a full lockdown, because measures to contain the spread of the virus may yet prevent it and more severe action would threaten the livelihoods of many Australians.On Tuesday evening Morrison announced that real estate auctions and open houses, markets, personal services including beauty salons, food courts in shopping centres, arcades, amusement parks, play centres, community centres, health and fitness, social sport, cultural institutions and swimming pools will all be closed.Morrison told reporters in Canberra that Australians would be urged to “stay at home unless it is absolutely necessary you go out”, suggesting that outings should be limited to “basics” such as attendance at work, exercise with a partner or small group, or attending shops to buy food or medicine.Morrison acknowledged that New South Wales and Victoria – which pushed for more extensive restrictions – were “far more advanced” than other states in terms of case numbers, but despite not all states being in the same position, the cabinet had still achieved “consistency of application”.With hundreds of thousands facing unemployment, the federal government has suspended mutual obligations to apply for jobs to obtain jobseeker payments for one week, with further measures to protect renters now expected to be decided on Wednesday not Tuesday, as planned.In addition to widespread business closures, Morrison announced new restrictions on funerals, which must be limited to 10 people or fewer, and weddings, which are limited to the marrying couple, celebrant and witnesses.Social visits to one another’s houses “should be kept to a minimum and with a very small numbers of guests”, he said, although the government would not be “overly specific” on the limits of social life.Morrison warned that states and territories would also consider whether to make it an offence to hold house parties, with barbecues and birthday gatherings also listed as events that should no longer occur.Morrison said the “do not travel” advisory on overseas trips would be upgraded to a ban on Wednesday, with limited exceptions for essential work, aid workers and compassionate grounds.The federal government will also look to create a new offence in relation to profiteering on the export of essential goods overseas, including medical supplies and personal protective equipment.Asked if a fuller lockdown, such as implemented by the UK, was now inevitable, Morrison replied “hopefully it is not necessary”.Morrison said the medical advice remained to keep schools open, and he would meet with the education sector and unions on Wednesday about measures to do so while protecting teachers.On Tuesday, the total number of coronavirus cases in Australia reached 2,139, with 95 new cases confirmed in NSW, 78 in Queensland and 56 in Victoria.A group of experts from the Group of Eight universities, asked by the chief medical officer to advise on social distancing, backed the “the stronger decisions being now taken by government and what we term as the ‘go now, go hard and go smart’ strategy”.In a letter sent to the health minister, Greg Hunt, on Sunday, the experts warned at its current rate of increase Australia “could theoretically expect over 6,000 cases by the end of next week and over 50,000 cases by Easter”.They recommended that Australia “without delay implements national stronger social distancing measures, more extensive banning of mass gatherings, school closure or class dismissal”.In Queensland, the border was shut to non-essential travel in order to help limit the spread of Covid-19, with limited exemptions for freight, emergencies and travel to and from work.The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said that her state was “at a critical stage in relation to the virus” after a “significant increase in the number of cases again overnight”.“If you see how the virus is getting out of control around the world, if you see the huge escalation in deaths, many countries did not control the spread at this stage of the virus,” Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.“But many countries did not take some of the actions this early on in the process in order to control the spread.“And I don’t want to be another example of a jurisdiction that didn’t do what it needed to do at the right time.”Earlier, Hunt said the government’s “general direction” was that people should “spend more time at home, obviously keeping the distance” but it would use a “staged approach” to implement further restrictions.“These ideas that some have heard of house parties – they’re out,” he said. “They are out, let me be absolutely clear on that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus

Abe said a postponement was unavoidable if the 2020 Games could not be held in a complete manner amid the coronavirus pandemic.A spokeswoman from the World Health Organization has said the US risks becoming the next centre of the coronavirus outbreak as the country is seeing a “very large acceleration” in cases. This comes amid concern the US president could be prioritising the economy in his crisis response. Trump said he was eager to reopen the US economy in weeks, not months, even as the death toll from the virus continued to rise.The number of new coronavirus cases in Spain jumped on Tuesday to 39,673 from 33,089 cases registered on Monday, the health ministry reported.Large sections of the Australian economy and social life will be shut down, after the national cabinet agreed to a range of further restrictions on indoor and outdoor gatherings in addition to a ban on non-essential overseas travel to combat the Covid-19 outbreak.But despite the range of further restrictions, Scott Morrison said the national cabinet would not “just rush on the sense of an opinion of inevitability” towards a full lockdown, because measures to contain the spread of the virus may yet prevent it and more severe action would threaten the livelihoods of many Australians.

Under the rules, people must stay at home unless they have to leave the house to work, to get essential supplies of food or medicine, to help the vulnerable or for one period of exercise a day.The biggest confusion was over whether workers should count their jobs as essential, with construction workers, taxi drivers and tradespeople unsure. Construction workers were told to still go to work but stay two metres apart and tradespeople, such as plumbers and electricians, could attend emergencies in people’s homes.South Africa’s confirmed number of coronavirus cases rose to 554 from 402 a day earlier, as businesses raced to make plans for a nationwide lockdown from midnight on Thursday.Iran reported 1,726 new coronavirus cases in last 24 hours raising the total number to 24,811.All travel restrictions in and out of Hubei province, the centre of the pandemic, will be lifted on Wednesday, except for in the city Wuhan, which will have to wait until 8 April.

The cause of the pneumonia was found to be a new virus – severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or Sars-CoV-2. The illness caused by the virus is Covid-19.Now declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the majority of people who contract Covid-19 suffer only mild, cold-like symptoms.So how can Covid-19 develop into a more serious illness featuring pneumonia, and what does that do to our lungs and the rest of our body? Australia spoke with Prof John Wilson, president-elect of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and a respiratory physician.He says almost all serious consequences of Covid-19 feature pneumonia.Wilson says people who catch Covid-19 can be placed into four broad categories.The least serious are those people who are “sub-clinical” and who have the virus but have no symptoms.Next are those who get an infection in the upper respiratory tract, which, Wilson says, “means a person has a fever and a cough and maybe milder symptoms like headache or conjunctivitis”.He says: “Those people with minor symptoms are still able to transmit the virus but may not be aware of it.”The largest group of those who would be positive for Covid-19, and the people most likely to present to hospitals and surgeries, are those who develop the same flu-like symptoms that would usually keep them off work.A fourth group, Wilson says, will develop severe illness that features pneumonia.The WHO says the elderly and people with underlying problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.When people with Covid-19 develop a cough and fever, Wilson says this is a result of the infection reaching the respiratory tree – the air passages that conduct air between the lungs and the outside.He says: “The lining of the respiratory tree becomes injured, causing inflammation. This in turn irritates the nerves in the lining of the airway. Just a speck of dust can stimulate a cough.“But if this gets worse, it goes past just the lining of the airway and goes to the gas exchange units, which are at the end of the air passages.“If they become infected they respond by pouring out inflammatory material into the air sacs that are at the bottom of our lungs.”He says lungs that become filled with inflammatory material are unable to get enough oxygen to the bloodstream, reducing the body’s ability to take on oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide.“That’s the usual cause of death with severe pneumonia,” he says.Prof Christine Jenkins, chair of Lung Foundation Australia and a leading respiratory physician, told  Australia: “Unfortunately, so far we don’t have anything that can stop people getting Covid-19 pneumonia.“People are already trialling all sorts of medications and we’re hopeful that we might discover that there are various combinations of viral and anti-viral medications that could be effective. At the moment there isn’t any established treatment apart from supportive treatment, which is what we give people in intensive care.“We ventilate them and maintain high oxygen levels until their lungs are able to function in a normal way again as they recover.”Wilson says patients with viral pneumonia are also at risk of developing secondary infections, so they would also be treated with anti-viral medication and antibiotics.“In some situations that isn’t enough,” he says of the current outbreak. “The pneumonia went unabated and the patients did not survive.”Jenkins says Covid-19 pneumonia is different from the most common cases that people are admitted to hospitals for.“Most types of pneumonia that we know of and that we admit people to hospital for are bacterial and they respond to an antibiotic.Wilson says there is evidence that pneumonia caused by Covid-19 may be particularly severe. Wilson says cases of coronavirus pneumonia tend to affect all of the lungs, instead of just small parts.But Wilson says this “first responder mechanism” can be impaired in some groups, including people with underlying heart and lung conditions, diabetes and the elderly.Jenkins says that, generally, people aged 65 and over are at risk of getting pneumonia, as well as people with medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer or a chronic disease affecting the lungs, heart, kidney or liver, smokers, Indigenous Australians, and infants aged 12 months and under.“Age is the major predictor of risk of death from pneumonia. Pneumonia is always serious for an older person and in fact it used to be one of the main causes of death in the elderly. Now we have very good treatments for pneumonia.“It’s important to remember that no matter how healthy and active you are, your risk for getting pneumonia increases with age. This is because our immune system naturally weakens with age, making it harder for our bodies to fight off infections and diseases.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/118916df439f57151b396cfb323f99a9e7b2bdf8/0_200_6076_3646/master/6076.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e47418d9aa242fb2e54dc07670f782c2","title":"home deliveries humvees life under jordan harsh coronavirus lockdown","story":"Residents face a year in jail if they leave home – no grocery shopping, no pharmacy visits, no short walksThe quarantine law says anyone caught outside will be jailed for up to a year. The car is parked on the street outside, with a box of water in the boot. Do you risk it?Such have been the sort of dilemmas facing people in Jordan since Saturday morning, when the Middle Eastern kingdom introduced one of the most stringent anti-coronavirus regimes in the world.It was announced at 7am by rounds of air-raid sirens: every person in the country indefinitely confined to their homes. No grocery shopping. No trips to pharmacies. Not even a walk around the block. Those with medical emergencies could call the authorities, but anyone caught outside would be arrested. More than 800 people have been picked up so far, the military says.Videos circulating on social media show army Humvees patrolling Amman’s beige streets. Another clip showed a veiled woman who parked her car in the middle of an empty street and danced to the music blaring from her stereo. Local media reported later reported her arrest.Jordan has undergone the same whiplash-inducing shift to a new era as other countries. Nine days ago, cafes were full, tourist sites were open and just person had tested for the virus, and recovered.In a cascade over the next days, flights were cancelled, Jordan’s airport closed, the borders of Amman sealed, non-essential businesses shut and, finally, everyone ordered to stay home.The curfew, imposed because people were flouting the government’s plaintive requests to stay home of their own volition, was announced at 3pm on the day before it came into force, triggering an immediate run on bakeries and supermarkets. In the hours before people would be isolated from each other for their protection, they were pressed shoulder-to-shoulder buying bread and milk.On Monday, a government spokesman told Jordanians the curfew would extend for weeks, and they should make do with the basics until then. An unprecedented scheme for delivering bread, water and pharmaceuticals to the population of 10 million is being trialled from Tuesday, though how it will work is still unclear. Ministers have already warned citizens to get used to the absence of luxuries.Possible problems abound. Will there be enough workers or cars to deliver on what is sure to be enormous demand? Will farmers and distributors be allowed out to keep the food system running? And what happens when people run out of cash?For my circle, the toll of the curfew so far has been an accumulation of small inconveniences. The elaborate meals we planned to cook during isolation have been pared back. Supplies of hay fever medicine in our house have dwindled to a single pill. A friend with two dogs can’t walk either of them but says they are entertaining each other, for now.But Jordan has shouldered far more than its fair share of refugees from across the region. On farms, in the poorer quarters of cities and in sprawling camps, more than 650,000 Syrians are also confined to their homes. There are few more resilient communities in the world, but most cannot afford to stockpile food for weeks.“Those who can look after themselves are looking after themselves,” Ahmed, a Syrian who fled to Jordan from the city of Hama, said last week. “Those who don’t have food, don’t.”The gamble is that a few weeks of difficulty might spare Jordan the horror that Italy, Iran and others are experiencing. Jordan has 112 coronavirus cases so far, with all but one said to be in good condition. The country’s health system is ranked by the World Health Organization as one of the least prepared in the region to fight a pandemic. The government had to act fast, and drastically.If those who are confirmed to be sick are properly treated if asymptomatic cases are confined long enough for the virus to work its way through them, their households and environments if authorities can keep people satisfied long enough so that they adhere to the rules and if the borders remain closed, preventing new cases from entering – Jordan could avoid the worst.Four big “ifs”. On Monday night, the third day of the curfew, Jordanians gathered on their balconies to sing and cheer in solidarity with each other and health workers. It is to be a nightly ritual. Over the next weeks, it will convey the public mood."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0a6c9a05dfbe8b80193a8256cff54d2993a6f08/0_14_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b170e0cd7543d47d1d75638f670c36e5","title":"open thread share your thoughts and experiences on coronavirus","story":"You can share your thoughts, experiences and what is going on near you in the comments belowBoris Johnson has locked down the UK telling people to stay at home.

But while the virus seems more forgiving towards the young, it can be merciless towards older adults.

In anticipation of seeing him again, Andrea’s only way to express his affection is to make drawings, which the doctors have dutifully delivered to his father.In one of these, Andrea imagined how to stop the spread of coronavirus.

Otherwise you’ll have to go out to get groceries, and then you might get the virus if you leave the house.”People in Italy’s southern regions are bracing themselves as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases grows daily. In locked-down Palermo, Sicily, Michele has already found a cure for Covid-19.“It’s a magic potion. You see, coronavirus is a small little creature, almost invisible. You can only see it using a microscope. It can jump from one spot to another. And there’s not just one. It can multiply. We have to use the magic potion to hit the biggest of them, the coronavirus monster that brought them to life. If we splash it with the magic potion, then all the other viruses will die.”And if Michele’s strategy doesn’t work, he already has a plan B: the sun. Even if the World Health Organization hasn’t confirmed that higher spring temperatures might weaken the virus, Michele knows that the sun will kill it. “It’ll use a flaming sword,” he says. “Unless I discover the potion first. I’m even starting to get bored here in the house. Fine, I don’t have to go to school every day, but I miss my friends and classmates.”Marco and his younger brother live in Lozzo Atestino, in the province of Padua – one of the first Italian cities hit by the virus. The two brothers and their parents have all been ill with Covid-19.Marco wrote to the : “Unfortunately, my little brother and I had the bad luck of getting to know the coronavirus. Everything started on 20 February, when we found out the virus had arrived in neighbouring towns. Mum tried to reassure me by saying we’re all healthy, but a few days later she got sick and I was worried and sad.”While the kids haven’t shown serious symptoms, their parents got increasingly unwell until they needed to be taken to hospital. “That was the worst day,” Marco says. “I remember we were in the ambulance and my mum wasn’t breathing well. My little brother started crying. When we arrived at the hospital, I started crying too because I thought they’d have to take us away from our parents.”Fortunately, that didn’t happen, and from that point on Marco and his family began a long period of quarantine that is still under way. “The days go by and we can’t have any contact with anyone. Mum orders groceries using the phone, and they leave the bags outside at the gate. I see my grandparents, aunts and uncles on video calls.”While waiting for the results of the next round of tests, Marco and his brother see the outside world through a large window in their home. “I can’t wait until coronavirus will just leave us in peace,” he says. “I can’t wait to go and play outside. But if there’s one thing I learned, it’s the importance of health and the love of my family.”Coronavirus has pushed the city of Bergamo, Lombardy, to its limits there aren’t even enough coffins to transport the dead. A thousand people have died here since the outbreak of the crisis. Crematorium ovens are unable to keep up, and the armed forces have to transfer the bodies to other cities.Greta and Riccardo have run out of paper, when drawing is one of the most important activities that keeps them busy while shut in their home. For weeks, Italians have been hanging large paper sheets from their windows with a rainbow and the phrase “Andrà tutto bene” (everything will be fine).Greta and Riccardo wanted to make one, too, but they can’t buy paper because shops are closed. To join in the movement, they managed to glue four precious sheets together. But as the days drag on, the kids’ nerves are on edge. “I feel really bad, I get bored too much, and nothing’s getting better,” Greta repeats to her mother.In Bologna, in the region of Emilia-Romagna, things are no better. There are more than 7,000 cases of coronavirus here, and 800 people have died. Francesco has no intention of giving up. He sees the emergency as a struggle between David and Goliath. David represents the humans. Goliath, the coronavirus, says: “I’m going to infect the whole world!” How can such a small creature like David defeat the virus?Francesco has no doubt. The weapon people have to defeat the virus is the same strength that has been uniting Italy: “You won’t be able to infect the world as long as there’s humanity!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abbe285e07b538e92c5ff342a8fda2c2cecd4d79/0_398_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f54b93cbb0918b2502ffa98055288f4","title":"uk coronavirus lockdown rules what you can and cannot do","story":"Everything we know about the restrictions so farBritain is now in lockdown, and all non-essential businesses must close.But many questions remain after Monday night’s historic broadcast by the prime minister with many people unsure what they can and cannot do, or which businesses are essential and non-essential.

Whitehall and council planners want to harness the enthusiasm of 2,700 grassroots groups that have formed in streets, villages and towns across the UK since the start of the crisis under the Covid-19 Mutual Aid umbrella.Ian Hudspeth, chair of the Local Government Association’s wellbeing board and leader of Oxfordshire county council, said the volunteers would be asked to help deliver basic food and hygiene supplies to extremely vulnerable people, up to 1.5 million of whom the government has ordered to stay at home for 12 weeks.Councils, supermarkets, members of the armed forces and community volunteers will be formed into a supply chain to deliver parcels to citizens being told by the NHS to go into lockdown for three months because of their underlying medical conditions. They will be asked to register online and request food and other supplies only if they lack family or friends who could otherwise help. He said the first deliveries would contain the same basic range of products, but that people would later be able to select from a menu of items to reduce waste.The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government confirmed it was working with “the grocery industry, local government, local resilience and emergency partners and voluntary groups to ensure that essential items can start to be delivered as soon as possible to those who need it”.It said the military was not likely to be used in doorstep deliveries, but that councils would be expected to “draw on the voluntary sector and emergency services”.Based on an analysis of the membership of 100 of its groups, Covid-19 Mutual Aid estimates that as many as 2.5 million people have signed up, mostly through Facebook pages. The figure includes people offering to help and those seeking assistance for themselves or family members.“This is people stepping up to do what they can,” said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for the umbrella organisation. “But this is not necessarily the answer. In terms of most food deliveries, this is not a replacement for an institutional response that is going to be needed.”Some Covid-19 Mutual Aid volunteers have told the  it has sometimes been a struggle to persuade the elderly to accept offers of help. Some have said they would also like to see more centralised coordination of volunteering, including criminal records checks.Steve Nuttall, part of the support group in Semer, a village in Suffolk, said it took him five minutes to convince his 80-year-old neighbour to stay at home and let him go shopping for him.“Convincing older people to stay at home and that they are in a vulnerable situation is how I see the next few weeks going,” he said. “The government needs to do an awful lot more to help volunteer groups in terms of clear direction, resources and helping local support groups and to encourage people to help set up groups in their communities.”The Poole group in Dorset attracted 400 volunteers in just over a week, although just five are currently completing errands, said Sarah Ward, one of its organisers. “We get a lot of phone calls from people elsewhere in the country who have elderly relatives in Poole who want us to contact them and make sure they’re okay in self-isolation,” she said.The group takes food orders over the phone, places them with shops and asks customers to call the shops to pay by card. The volunteer then delivers the package, maintaining physical distancing at the drop-off.

We are helping the states to get equipment, but it is not easy.”But while more US governors were urging people to stay at home, Trump appeared to play down the crisis on Monday night.The president said he was considering ways to restart the economy in the coming weeks and wanted to avoid the pandemic becoming “a long-lasting financial problem”. It would not last as long as three or four months, he said.“Our country was not built to be shut down,” Trump said. “This is not a country that was built for this.”Trump’s senior advisers referred to current government restrictions as a “15-day challenge” and pledged to revisit in a week’s time the need for sweeping measures to prevent the spread of the virus.The top coronavirus response official in Italy, the country with the highest death toll, attributed two successive declines in the daily death rate to a national lockdown that appeared to be finally bearing fruit.But Angelo Borrelli also noted that the real number of infections was probably 10 times higher than the official count. He also said the nation of 60 million was on course to overtake China’s total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in a week.“The measures we took two weeks ago are starting to have an effect,” Borrelli said in an interview with La Repubblica. He said more data over the next few days will help understand “if the growth curve is really flattening”. An estimated 1.7 billion people around the world have been ordered to remain at home as governments take extreme measures to protect their populations. Britain became the latest country to enter lockdown, after bans on movement came into force at midnight on Monday.France entered a two-month “state of health emergency” on Tuesday that provides a legal framework for existing confinement and restrictive measures and allows the government to order further restrictions, including controlling the price of certain products and requisitioning people and property for the “war” effort.In Germany, Angela Merkel’s cabinet presented a support package worth hundreds of billions of euros to cushion the impact of the crisis, in a departure from the country’s commitment to balance budgets. Under the rescue measures, about €50bn is to be earmarked for small businesses and self-employed workers, who are to receive direct grants of up to €15,000 over three months. The Dutch government strengthened its containment measures, banning all public gatherings regardless of size until 1 June and empowering mayors to close beaches, parks, campsites and other public spaces if people are not respecting physical distancing rules.In other developments:Meanwhile, tens of millions of people living in Hubei province, the centre of China’s outbreak, were told they would be able to resume travel from midnight (1600 GMT), except in the city of Wuhan.China claims to have largely brought its outbreak under control, reporting only imported cases of the virus and few or no new domestic cases in recent days. However, the claims have been questioned by residents and analysts, who note that some hospitals are reportedly refusing to test for the virus, and that there are allegations of manipulated numbers and rumours of unreported cases.Additional reporting by Kim Willsher in Paris, Jennifer Rankin in the Netherlands and Helen Davidson in Sydney"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fe7c874405d66746447a503a862df58d88c246a/251_110_552_331/master/552.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b62d878698a0c6c59d0790267d237aac","title":"coronavirus map how covid 19 is spreading across the world","story":"Confirmed cases of Covid-19 have ned the globe, and now exceed 339,000.

Photograph: Colin Keegan, Collins DublinThere is a growing expectation that the Government will introduce further measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus on Tuesday, when public health experts are due to present new advice to ministers.A ban on all non-essential travel, commercial and social activity are expected to be among the unprecedented options to be discussed by ministers at the Cabinet’s weekly meeting at Government Buildings.The Government’s public health experts are meeting early on Tuesday morning to consider a range of possible actions and will advise the Cabinet of any new restrictions they believe are now necessary to slow the spread of the virus.It is expected that significant new restrictions on travel, work and movement will be announced, which are likely to mirror recent moves made by several European countries and by the British government on Monday night.Among the options under consideration by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), which will make the recommendations to Cabinet, are the closure of non essential business premises, closures of playgrounds where they have not been closed already and stricter implementation of physical distancing in parks and on beaches. There is a reluctance in government to close public spaces.The meeting comes following the death of two more patients from Covid-19. Both involved males in the east of the country, bring the total number of deaths to six.Another 219 cases have been reported, the biggest daily increase seen yet, the NPHET said on Monday evening.There are now a total of 1,125 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the Republic, according to chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan.Dr Holohan said he was “very pleased” with the response of the public to the restrictive measures introduced 10 days ago, with most people acting “very responsibly”.“We didn’t set out to have every person comply with every single measure the aim is for most of the people to comply with most of the measures most of the time.”But he said he was “not satisfied in every situation”. Where pubs were found to be in breach of the measures, the new powers available could be used to effect closure. The Garda’s assistance had also been asked in relation to social distancing.He said it was too early to evaluate the success of the measures but this would be considered at the next meeting of the team on Tuesday. This meeting will also decide whether the measures will be extended beyond the original end-date of March 29th.With the backlog of people waiting to be tested reaching 40,000 over the weekend, Dr Holohan said it was still the intention to “test as quickly and as broadly as possible”.He said “tens of thousands” of people were now seeking testing every day as demand increased, and this was putting pressure on services. As well as healthcare workers, people with clinically advanced forms of the disease in hospital would be prioritised for testing.Dr Holohan said there may be a lot of “worried well” among those seeking tests and it was expected demand would drop over time.While the average waiting time - currently at four to five days, according to the HSE - was “longer than we would like” due to constraints in the supply of testing equipment, the advice for those awaiting testing was still to self-isolate, he said.“We’re on our way to a substantial increase in testing capacity, which should reduce turnaround time.”Asked whether any completed swabs had expired while waiting to be processed, Dr Holohan replied: “I can’t honestly say that hasn’t happened”. More information would be available at Tuesday’s briefing, he indicated.Men account for 55 per cent of cases, according to an analysis of cases reported up to last Saturday.Some 29 per cent of patients have been hospitalised, and 25 per cent of cases are associated with healthcare workers. Twenty-five patients have been admitted to ICU.Community transmission now accounts for 45 per cent of cases, close contact with confirmed cases for 23 per cent and travel abroad for 31 per cent. Some 37 clusters have been reported, involving an average of 5-6 cases each.The vast majority of people are following guidelines on social distancing and hand hygiene and are able to recognise symptoms, research commissioned by the Department of Health indicates.Some 88 per cent of people say they are staying at home rather than going out, according to the survey, while 84 per cent say they are practising social distancing in a queue.Seven out of 10 people report they are sitting further apart from others, and most people are aware of the main symptoms of coronavirus.Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation said the pandemic is accelerating with more than 300,000 cases now recorded and infections reported from nearly every country worldwide.While it took 67 days from the first reported case to reach the first 100,000 cases of Covid-19, it took only 11 days for the second 100,000 cases, and just four days for the third 100,000 cases, said WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.He called for global political commitment to change the trajectory of the pandemic, urging countries to take both defensive and attacking measures. – Additional reporting ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4210794.1585055757!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus schools closure to be extended as new restrictions to be announced","story":"Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan has warned that Ireland is at an early stage in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic.

We don’t know where we are going to be in terms of the peak of this virus.“I think we owe it to those young people who are studying and putting in the effort to see this through to try to have these exams this year.”His comments come as the Government is set to introduce further measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus on Tuesday, with a ban on all non-essential travel, commercial and social activity among the options to be discussed by Ministers at the Cabinet meeting.The spread of the pandemic has also prompted the postponement of the Olympics to 2021.Public health experts are meeting on Tuesday morning to consider a range of possible actions and will advise the Cabinet of any new restrictions they believe are now necessary to slow the spread of the virus.However, it is expected that significant new restrictions on travel, work and movement will be announced, which are likely to mirror recent moves made by several European countries and by the British government on Monday night.RecommendationsAmong the options under consideration by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), which will make the recommendations to Cabinet, are the closure of non-essential business premises, playgrounds where they have not been closed already, and stricter implementation of physical distancing in parks and on beaches. There is a reluctance in Government to close public spaces.Speaking after the NPHET meeting, Minister for Health Simon Harris said: “The public health emergency team has just concluded and they made a series of recommendations and I will be bringing them to the cabinet meeting this morning and Government will make announcements accordingly later.“There is a massive national effort under way in our country to keep our people safe and to keep our people well.“Irish people are making huge sacrifices in communities right across the country and I want to thank them for that,” he said.“What Government wants to do is support them in their efforts and to make sure we can keep our people safe and well.”Two more patients died from Covid-19, the NPHET said on Monday evening, and a record number of 219 new cases were reported.There are now a total of 1,125 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the Republic, according to chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan.Support packageMeanwhile, “ten of thousands” of people are seeking to be tested each day, Dr Holohan revealed, and priority will be given to healthcare workers and the sickest patients.One element in the Government’s support packages will be a substantial increase in the €203 welfare payment announced earlier this month for people who lost their job due to the Covid-19 emergency.The second element is an income support scheme similar to that announced recently by the Danish and UK governments. The Irish scheme will take weeks to fully set up but the outline is set to be announced by the Government on Tuesday. The precise details were still being worked out on Monday night.The scheme will see the State pay businesses 70-80 per cent of a worker’s salary up to a level of €35,000-€40,000, or about the average wage, and the business will then pay the worker.Businesses applying for State support will have to prove their income has dropped by 25 per cent and that they have liquidity difficulties.One-tier systemThe Government is also likely to order that holders of private health insurance will receive no special privileges for hospital admissions during the crisis.Sources say the health service will operate essentially as a “one-tier” system, with admission to hospital decided solely on clinical need.The two new Covid-19 deaths involved males in the east of the country, and brought the total number of deaths to six.Dr Holohan said he was “very pleased” with the response of the public to the restrictive measures introduced 10 days ago, and said the aim was for “most of the people to comply with most of the measures most of the time”.The World Health Organisation has warned the pandemic was accelerating. “It took 67 days from the first reported case to reach the first 100,000 cases 11 days for the second 100,000 and just four days for the third 100,000,” WHO director general Dr Tedros said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Ban on non-essential travel, commercial and social activity discussed as Olympics postponedPlea follows reports of parents being asked to pay holding fee to ensure place in crecheGlen Murphy (7) was mauled by dogs at house near Saggart in DublinPair are struggling to return home following advice to self-isolate and flight restrictionsTrade union says proper social distancing cannot be maintained on sitesFlight \u0026lsquowill depend on how soon aircraft can be accommodated by Peruvian authorities\u0026rsquoAmerican students choose to remain in Belfast and Dublin as virus spreads globallyMartin Fraser\u0026rsquos intervention seen as challenge to leaders to form a governmentWhich? calls for Covid-19 not be used as excuse to undermine consumer protectionsGarda\u0026iacute welcome new shift patterns and support from publicState\u0026rsquos strategy for controlling Covid-19 has put unprecedented pressure on our virus testing systemPlans also in place to enable people in temporary accommodation to self-isolateCabinet to discuss ban on commercial, social activity and on all non-essential travelSignificant new restrictions on movement expected after death toll rises to sixEmergency legislation to be rushed through Oireachtas amid constitutional concern over SeanadWebsites being monitored \u0026lsquoto check compliance with consumer protection law\u0026rsquoPaula Farrell has pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughterStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus irish couple stranded in nz totally in limbo","story":"An Irish couple stranded in New Zealand have said they have been left “totally in limbo” due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Ms Boland resigned from her job last week after her partner lost his job, and the couple had decided to return to Ireland. However, Ms Boland was informed she was in contact with a person who potentially had coronavirus and that she and her partner should self-isolate.

Photograph: Chris RatcliffeBloomberg via GettyThe trade union Unite has called for the closure of construction sites throughout the country to try halt the spread of the coronavirus.The union said on Tuesday that adequate social distancing measures could not be maintained on building sites.The union wants workers, including those who it categorised as “bogus self employed in the construction sector “ to be covered by a wage subsidy scheme proposed by the trade union movement which would see the Government pay about 75 per cent of employee’s wages up to a cap equivalent of €40,000 per year over the coming months.Unite’s Regional Officer for Construction Tom Fitzgerald said:“It has become increasingly clear to our members, who work on sites throughout the country, that adequate social distancing cannot be maintained either on site or, in many cases, when travelling to and from sites. Susceptible“The result is that approximately 150,000 construction workers are not only themselves susceptible to the spread of Covid-19, but are also at risk of bringing the virus back home to their families and communities – further increasing the strain on our health services.”“Last night’s online meeting of the national construction branch (of Unite) , attended by senior reps with hundreds of years’ experience between them, heard numerous concrete example of where social distancing cannot be maintained.”Mr Fitzgerald said Unite was concerned that as the situation escalated, “responsible employers may close sites and find themselves effectively undercut by irresponsible employers whose sites remain open, putting workers and the general public at risk”.“We are therefore calling on the Government to immediately close all sites, and to ensure that all construction workers – including so-called bogus self-employed workers in sub-contracting chains – are included in a wage compensation scheme such as that proposed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. This virus does not distinguish between workers on different types of contracts, and neither should the Government’s response: all workers on a site must be presumed to be employed.”“No worker should be forced to choose between health or hardship.”Separately the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (Ictu) and the Construction Industry Federation (CIF) in a joint statement on Tuesday urged construction companies, industry companies and their employees to comply with HSE guidance on protecting themselves from the Covid-19 virus.Social distancingIctu general secretary Patricia King said: “Essentially workers should adhere to social distancing guidelines, carry out regular hand washing and use gloves and masks if possible to help contain the spread of the virus in the workplace. “The HSE has issued guidelines on the coronavirus and we recommend that this guidance is adhered to by workers in the construction industry. Congress will continue to watch the situation closely.”Tom Parlon, director general of the CIF said social distancing and compliance with HSE guidance on Covid-19 were now critical to the continuation of the construction industry and for the nation. “We urge contractors and workers to work together to enforce social distancing regardless of any impacts on productivity or deadlines.”“The CIF is also asking companies to remind workers that social distancing is critical off-site and on the way to the site.

Photograph: Paolo AguilarEPAThe Government’s plan to bring home 135 Irish people stranded in Peru by the country’s coronavirus lockdown is awaiting the green light from the government in Lima.An email to those stranded sent on Monday morning by the Irish embassy in Chile said the timing of the proposed charter flight out of Lima “will depend on how soon our aircraft can be accommodated by the Peruvian authorities”.Tánaiste Simon Coveney told RTÉ on Sunday an agreement has been reached between British Airways and Aer Lingus to charter a flight from Lima “in the next few days”. As well as Irish nationals dependants who are entitled to live in Ireland can also take the flight.The embassy email also said Irish authorities “will confirm details in due course for bus transfers within Peru from agreed locations to the military airport in Lima”. Only an estimated half of the 135 Irish, most of whom are backpackers, are currently in Lima with local travel restrictions preventing the rest making their own way to the capital.Repatriation will cost each traveller €400 but they will not be required to pay the fare in advance. Anyone diagnosed or showing symptoms of coronavirus, also know as Covid-19, will not be able to travel. At least six people have died of the virus in Peru with another 363 people confirmed infected.‘Not straightforward’Mr Coveney told RTÉ that organising the flight out of Peru “is not straighforward”. France and Israel are among the countries that have already sent planes to bring their nationals home. But thousands of other foreigner are still stranded in one of South America’s most popular tourist destinations.Peru has all but shut its land air and sea frontiers in response to the global pandemic. It announced a strict 15-day stay-in-doors quarantine on March 16th giving foreigners just 24 hours to leave the country. Many were left stranded and have since been reliant on their respective government to come up with a solution to get them out.On Sunday authorities closed fully the international airport in Lima. Now only flights bringing home Peruvian citizens or coming to evacuate foreign nationals can fly into the country and must land at the capital’s military airbase. Travellers stranded at the international airport were forced to make their way to the base in the hope of their governments sending planes to rescue them.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4204988.1584444197!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"share your covid 19 story have you lost your job or business","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA shopper wearing a face mask on Grafton Street, Dublin last weekend.

Photograph: Sally HaydenAs the western world practices “social distancing”, residents of the world’s slums grapple with the idea that they could be decimated by a coronavirus outbreak.In Namuwongo, a slum area of Ugandan capital Kampala riven through by disused train tracks, residents are still flogging wares and gathering at a well to collect water, while children play and run around.“People are many,” says John Kungu, Namuwongo’s local council chairman for the past 29 years, watching dozens of people walk by him in all directions. “People are congested, they’re poor, they’re looking for money. People are many and people are moving.”A few days before, he watched President Yoweri Museveni address the nation about Covid-19 and the importance of keeping apart from each other. Normally Kungu would hold a group meeting to tell locals about these developments, as many won’t have seen the speech, but this time he’s talking to iniduals and hoping they’ll pass the information on.“We have to fear because it is very dangerous,” he says. “People don’t have anywhere else to go. These are their homes. They need to stay in their homes.”Though the pandemic was slow to reach Africa, the World Health Organisation is now urging the continent to “prepare for the worst”, with Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s Ethiopian director general, saying African countries need to “wake up” to the threat of coronavirus.Across Africa, there are more than 1,400 confirmed coronavirus cases. Uganda declared its first case on Saturday, while closing its borders and airports to everything except cargo planes and vehicles. In the capital, wealthy residents have been stockpiling food and medical supplies. In the north, three inmates were shot dead as they tried to escape from a prison, frightened of being infected with Covid-19, according to local media.Roughly 21 per cent of Uganda’s population of more than 44 million are believed to be living under the poverty line.“How are you supposed to wash your hands regularly if you have no running water or soap? How can you implement ‘social distancing’ if you live in a slum or a refugee camp? . . . How are those with pre-existing health conditions going to take extra precautions if they already can’t afford or access the treatment they need?” asked Jonathan Whittall, head of humanitarian analysis for international medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), earlier this month.“This pandemic will also disproportionately affect those who can’t stock up on food because they already can’t afford a meal every night of the week those who are underpaid, overworked, and deprived of sick leave, or unable to work from home.”Hand to mouthKampala has more than 1.7 million residents – a significant proportion of whom are living in city slums. Many moved there from rural areas in search of work and have ended up crammed together, living hand to mouth.Many of their homes have no running water, meaning advice about regular hand washing is challenging to follow. Families of six, seven or eight often live packed into one room, making self-isolation impossible. Residents are weak from poor diets and have repeatedly faced outbreaks of cholera, measles and malaria. Toilets can be shared with hundreds of others.With so much else to worry about, not everyone in Namuwongo is convinced of the dangers of Covid-19. Sam Katongole, a slim 45-year-old wearing a cap with a peace sign on it, bounds up proferring a hand, saying he’s not frightened. “My blood is strong,” boasts the construction worker. “TB: They checked me and I was clear. HIV: They checked me and I was clear.”Instead, his biggest problem is “hunger because of no work”. Katongole’s family live five to one room. Each day, they collect two jerrycans of water from the well and use that to clean themselves and their home.He’s still going out, looking for scarce employment, because he can’t imagine his rent payments being halted no matter how bad the outbreak gets. “Landlords can’t accept that,” he says.For Taaka (36), a fish seller in Namuwongo market, business has also been disrupted. “The restrictions mean people don’t have money,” she says.“Something that can kill you you have to fear,” adds 56-year-old Apiyo Rose, who shares the stall with Taaka.Listening in, Rose’s son, 25-year-old Simon Bless, argues that Uganda’s workers need more protection. “In England if the football players don’t play they pay them the money, what about me?” he asks.‘Good businessman’In a shelter nearby, Alan Kiseka (30) collects plastic bags and recycles them. He idolises Donald Trump – “a good businessman” – and is also convinced coronavirus can’t hurt Ugandans medically. “Here in Uganda it can’t damage us, we have strong blood. We eat vegetables, you eat cooking oils,” he says.However, fear of the outbreak is hurting his company. Businesses that supply Kiseka with plastic scraps have stopped handing them over, which means he can’t sell them on. Damage to his income and that of his workers is what he’s most afraid of, he says.Sitting at a table outside, Mama Ojara (28), a tailor whose family live six in one room, says she doesn’t understand anything about how to prevent the virus. She couldn’t watch Museveni’s speech because she doesn’t have a television, and she has only seen two people wearing masks – “I don’t know where to buy them.”Churches and religious gatherings may be banned for one month, but Ojara is turning to prayer at this time of uncertainty. “I pray to God that it doesn’t come here, that’s all I can do,” she says.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4210273.1584994639!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus france hoping unorthodox virologist can save world","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProfessor Didier Raoult, the maverick virologist who says chloroquine cures coronavirusWe could know within two weeks whether Professor Didier Raoult, the French virologist who heads the Mediterranean infectious and tropical disease institute in Marseille, will go down in history as the man who saved the world from Covid-19, or will be dismissed as an arrogant, misguided scientist who raised false hopes.Raoult administered a cocktail of hydroxycloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, used to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, and azithromycin, an antibiotic used against bacterial pneumonia, to 24 Covid-19 patients.After receiving 600mg of Plaquenil (one of the commercial names for chloroquine) and 250mg of azithromycin for six days, three-quarters of patients tested negative for the virus, while 90 per cent of the control group who did not take the drugs still tested positive.On February 25th, Raoult spoke of Chinese experiments with hydroxycloroquine in a video titled “Coronavirus: endgame!” He hastily conducted his own clinical study and revealed the results in a second video on March 16th.US president Donald Trump apparently learned of Raoult’s experiment through a Twitter post by the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk. On March 20th, Trump wrongly claimed in a White House press briefing that the US Food and Drug Administration had approved what he called “the very powerful” drug chloroquine to treat Covid-19.Trump was corrected by Dr Anthony Fauci, a top expert on infectious disease and a pillar of the fight against coronavirus. But Trump persisted, tweeting the following day that “HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE \u0026amp AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.”Pharmacies in west Africa, where chloroquine has been used for decades to treat malaria, saw a run on the drug. The government of Morocco purchased the entire stock of chloroquine produced by the French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi in Casablanca. Some French hospitals are administering Plaquenil out of “compassion” for the families of Covid-19 patients.Christian Estrosi, the mayor of Nice who has tested positive for Covid-19, “wants to trust” Raoult. Conservative senator Bruno Retailleau is exhorting the government to prescribe it more widely in French hospitals. Petitions supporting Raoult are circulating on the internet.The scientific community is ided. Raoult tested the drugs on a very small number of patients.“For the moment, there is no proof of the efficacy of this molecule on the disease, either for prevention or as treatment,” Dr Thierry Vial, head of a pharmacological centre in Lyon told, Le Figaro. “We have only preliminary data, which is encouraging and should be followed up, but is insufficient for systematic treatment of the illness.”Solid base“One cannot administer treatment without a solid basis, especially not chloroquine, which is not an ordinary medicine,” said Bernard Bégaud, professor of pharmacology at the University of Bordeaux.Pressure on the French government is such that health minister Olivier Véran announced at the weekend that chloroquine will be tested, with three other drugs, on 3,200 patients in the EU’s scientific programme Discovery, which is seeking a cure for Covid-19.Véran said he wants to know if Raoult’s study “can be repeated on a bigger scale in other hospitals, by independent teams”. This was necessary, Véran said, because “Never has any country in the world given authorisation for treatment on the basis of a study like this”.Véran also warned the public not to get their hopes up.“The history of viral disease is strewn with false good news, disappointments and reckless risks,” Véran said.Wariness of Raoult derives from his unconventional appearance, and from his reputation as a maverick. The television channel LCI described the hirsute professor as looking like “a druid in the Astérix comic books”.Raoult, age 68, was born in Senegal, where his father was a French military doctor. He moved to Marseille at age nine, joined the merchant navy at age 18, earned a literary baccalaureat at 20 and then went to medical school.Raoult shares a certain arrogance with Trump and Bolsonaro.“In my field, I am a star, worldwide,” he boasted to La Provence newspaper.“I don’t give a damn what others think. I am not an outsider. I’m streaks ahead of the others.”Like Trump and Bolsonaro, he is also a climate change denier.Yet millions of people are placing huge hopes in Raoult’s study. A high-ranking French civil servant, now retired, who is following the story closely, believes professional rivalry is interfering with the search for a cure.Raoult “is unanimously recognised by leading professors” but “annoys the establishment”, the source says. The fact that Raoult forced the French government to include chloroquine in European clinical tests “proves the strength of his de-Gaulle-like conviction”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus lockdown Q\u0026ampA: walking the dog, moving house, driving and moreComment: The Government must support Britain\u0026#39s forgotten workers – or face disastrous consequencesPolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak \u0026#39determined to help self-employed\u0026#39 -  but no announcement yetCoronavirus latest news: Can I go to work today?

If they could be tested, they could get back to work, say health analysts. On March 11, NHS England said it would be ramping up testing to 10,000 a day, and called on local hospital laboratories to help with the effort. A week later Boris Johnson vowed that would rise to 25,000 a day.Yet despite promises, the maximum number of tests performed in one day was 8,400 on Thursday March 19. Since then the average daily figure for testing has been 4,573.Lord Crisp, NHS Chief Executive and Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health from 2000 to 2006, told The  that the lack of testing of staff was an obvious bottleneck that the Government needed to address.We are seeing these situations where you have three junior doctors living as flatmates- one has a cough and three of them are off work for two weeks, he said. That is ridiculous.As of Sunday, Britain had carried out a total of 78,340 tests, around 1,164 per one million people, far behind many other countries. In Europe\u0027s worst-hit country – Italy – health teams performed more than 3,499 tests per one million citizens (206,886 tests).Most recent figures show that, more than a week ago, Germany had already carried out 167,009, the equivalent of 2,023 tests per one million people, while Norway has tested 6,000 per million (34,583 tests).Meanwhile, South Korea has tested 316,664 people – equivalent to 6,148 tests per one million population, while Singapore performed 6,507 tests per one million people.  Prof Rosalind Smyth, Director and Professor of Child Health, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, who is currently self-isolating with suspected coronavirus, warned that Britain simply had no idea how many cases it had because of a lack of testing. We have really very little idea of the number of  \u0027cases\u0027, and I am concerned that this figure is so misleading that it should not be used.  On conservative estimates, the true figure is likely to be five to 10 times higher. It may heighten concern as people think the case fatality rate is much higher than it is, or provide false reassurance that the number of cases in a given area is much lower than it is.On March 12, Britain said it would no longer be testing in the community and instead only checking people admitted to hospital for the virus, leading to widespread criticism from UK scientists. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu, Director-General of the World Health Organization,  criticised countries that are not testing sufficiently, warning them: You cannot fight a fire blindfolded… Test, test, test.He added: To win, we need to attack the coronavirus with aggressive and targeted tactics - testing every suspected Covid-19 case, isolating and caring for every confirmed case, and tracing and quarantining every close contact. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) also wrote to the Prime Minister saying it was crucial to test NHS workers and provide them with adequate personal protection equipment (PPE). In her letter, Dame Donna Kinnair, Chief Executive of the RCN, said: Our members have been unstinting in their dedication and professionalism to protecting the health and well-being of the United Kingdom - they must be supported by the Government and health sector in return.Our members are coming out of retirement, students are interrupting their studies, and nursing staff are deploying from non-clinical settings, all to support the frontline in the battle against Covid-19.We ask you to personally intervene and act to ensure enough supply of PPE and testing for Covid-19 is available for all nursing staff and our colleagues across the health and care system. Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said he hoped that the testing of medical staff would take place as soon as possible so that doctors, nurses and other NHS workers who may not have the virus but are self-isolating can get back to work.He told BBC Breakfast: We are rapidly expanding testing. We have been buying testing kits over this weekend and all of last week to make sure we have as much as possible.He said he hoped to say more about the expansion of tests in the next few days.Experts are also hopeful that a new antibody test, which can tell if people have been infected in the past, will be available soon to find out who is now immune. Prof Martin Hibberd, Professor of Emerging Infectious Disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: When this diagnostic does become available, I think it will become a big help in tackling the disease. Most likely this will be reserved for frontline healthcare workers and other key workers first and perhaps vulnerable groups later, before becoming more widely available.However, Dr Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, warned there aren\u0027t enough testing kits to go around the country and officials have refused to reveal how many tests were available to the NHS.Experts said they believe the lack of testing was less to do with unwillingness and more likely to be a lack of kits available and enough people to process the results. Dr Bharat Pankhania, Senior Clinical Lecturer, University of Exeter Medical School, added: Are we not testing enough? Yes, we aren\u0027t and this is most probably a capacity issue.We are having to pull out key workers when we\u0027re desperately need them because we\u0027re not certain if they have an infection.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rigorous testing route back free society coronavirus","story":"No one can now be in any doubt: this is the most serious social and economic crisis since the Second World War. If mishandled, the consequences will include millions of lives lost, devastating economic depression, social unrest and political upheaval. There can be few greater tests of decision-making and leadership.In Britain, as in many countries, the decisions made so far involve a vast increase in the role and power of the state. Never in peacetime has a government taken over so rapidly the financing and direction of so many areas of the economy, and never in history has it intruded so minutely into how iniduals live alongside each other.In a crisis unique in modern times, the drastic measures taken are wholly justified. Without a massive increase in government spending and the supply of credit, the economy would collapse, taking away many livelihoods for years to come. And without firm rules on “social distancing”, the actions of iniduals will fall short of what is needed for collective survival.It has become routine to compare these actions to those taken in wartime, and indeed there is no other parallel. As in war, the need to defend the whole of society justifies state interventions that would otherwise be indefensible. There is a long history of the temporary but necessary aggrandisement of state power. In the 1790s, faced with war and the threat of revolution, Pitt the Younger suspended habeas corpus and gatherings of more than 50 people. In the 1940s, Churchill presided over central direction of business on a vast scale.As Boris Johnson tightens the squeeze on the habits of our daily lives, he can be reassured that he is acting in this strong – and generally Tory – historical tradition. But at the same time he should not worry that his visible reluctance to take the most restrictive steps comes through to the public. Critics say it is confusing when he shows an understanding of peoples’ desire to enjoy fresh air and exercise while calling on them to stay apart. But personally I would far rather have a Prime Minister who hates telling the nation how to lead their lives than one who relishes the power to do so.The PM’s reluctance to preside over infringements of liberty will be a valuable instinct in the future. That is because this global crisis represents an earthquake sufficiently powerful to change the contours of politics, including the risk of clearing the ground for the idea of a more powerful state. Already, Chinese news organisations have been trumpeting the effectiveness of a centralised and authoritarian society in controlling the virus, notwithstanding their system’s initial suppression of knowledge of its origin. China’s ability to take action at home and send assistance abroad is being contrasted with chaos and lack of global leadership in Washington.While Beijing takes the opportunity to drive home this message, there will be other countries whose leaders will be reluctant to give up the exceptional powers the coronavirus has induced them to acquire. For radical socialists, the proof that the state can take over paying wages, direct vital businesses and create money without restraint will be a justification for decades to come of ideas in which they have always believed.Those of us who are fundamentally attached to an open, liberal and free society will therefore need to be firm in its defence, keeping three principles in mind.The first is that a crisis as grave as the one we are now experiencing does indeed justify the exceptional curtailment of some customary liberties. While voluntary collective action is to be preferred, government enforced action is much better than permitting a public health catastrophe. Reluctance to clamp down is a virtue, but in a fast moving crisis so is speed and decisiveness. Free societies have to safeguard lives at least as effectively as closed ones, immensely aided by public co-operation and consent but ultimately backed by clear authority. This is the principle on which the Government is acting now.Clearly, it is to be hoped that such severe measures will limit the loss of life, the strain on health services and staff, and also produce a diminution in the spread of the virus. Yet it seems certain that Covid-19 will be present in the world and a danger to every country for longer than lockdown-type measures can be maintained. Decisions will need to be made about the rules we will live under for a sustained period – when the immediate crisis has moderated but the risk of its return is high.Those decisionsshould be guided by a second important principle. To paraphrase Jeremy Bentham: “the greatest liberty of the greatest number” is the goal governments should have in mind. Of course, many universal personal habits, such as handshaking and kissing, might have to change for some time. But as soon as medical research and technology make it possible, restrictions on the economy and society should be eased in favour of a more inidual focus on preventing contagion.This is where large-scale testing comes in. Ministers have spoken of the availability in the near future of tests for the antibodies that will show who has had the virus and enjoys some immunity to it. Those people should then be back at work and free to travel. More widely, rigorous testing for the virus itself, and the ruthless isolating of anyone suffering from it and tracking of all their recent contacts, need to become the norm once the pandemic is on a more manageable scale. This has been the approach of Singapore and South Korea, and it is better than long term constraints on the whole population.Finally, it is vital never to lose sight of a third principle: that in the long term, the creativity, innovation, fresh ideas and resilience of a free society will always prove to be the best foundations for the pursuit of health, prosperity and happiness, including a sustainable environment. In the late 1940s, after the trauma of war, ideas of state planning and the continuation of wartime controls were predominant in Britain and much of Europe. By 1951, the winning slogan of a returning Churchill was “Set the People Free”. In these dark days, that is an objective that must always remain our inspiration.Coronavirus lockdown Q\u0026ampA: walking the dog, moving house, driving and moreComment: The Government must support Britain\u0026#39s forgotten workers – or face disastrous consequencesPolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak \u0026#39determined to help self-employed\u0026#39 -  but no announcement yetCoronavirus latest news: Can I go to work today?

Wuhan has been in total lockdown since Jan 23. Those seeking to travel out of the area will need to have a green health tracking code, a QR code obtained via Chinese apps. The government has not clarified if the latest directive supercedes previous announcements allowing non-Hubei residents to apply for permission to leave after being tested for the coronavirus, or if procuring the health code will suffice. Migrant labourers leaving the city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, will also be required to undergo nucleic acid tests before being allowed to leave on government-arranged transport, authorities said. It’s unclear, however, whether local officials will allow such people to enter other cities and provinces in Beijing, Hubei residents have continued to report trouble The lockdown is adding to optimism that the worst is over in China, though concerns persist over whether the figures reported by authorities continue to accurately reflect the scale of the outbreak. Chinese health officials are not counting asymptomatic patients who test positive, nor those discharged from hospital with follow-up results that continue to confirm a coronavirus infection. A picture circulated online of a Wuhan housing compound notice informing residents that two new cases had been found, dated March 20 – a day when the government reported zero cases in the city. Local authorities later said the two cases had been confirmed previously, though China’s poor track record with transparency and bungled initial response – including the silencing of whistleblowers – continues to seed doubt in the numbers both at home and abroad. Infection figures only began to subside a few weeks ago after China changed how it would count cases. Risks of a second outbreak remain as infections due to travellers arriving from abroad continue to tick upward, many of whom are Chinese nationals fleeing virus-hit countries. China’s national health commission reported 78 new infections on Monday, roughly double the cases a day prior. Most were imported illnesses, with only four locally transmitted cases, including one in Wuhan.Beijing clocked the most number of cases at 31, followed by Guangdong province in the south with 14, and Shanghai with nine. Across the country, there are now 427 imported coronavirus cases, and at least three people infected locally via a traveller arriving from abroad.Authorities are increasing containment measures on international passengers arriving in China, with Beijing authorities saying Tuesday that those entering the city will be subject to centralised quarantine and health checks. Prior to this, some people had been allowed to self-isolate. The southern city of Shenzhen also said Tuesday that it would test all arrivals. Macau, a Chinese territory and gambling hub, banning all visitors from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan foreigners were already barred from entering.The novel coronavirus epidemic, which originated in China, has infected about 382,000 people worldwide, killing more than 16,600 people.Additional reporting by Yiyin ZhongMore from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"contactless limit uk increased 45","story":"The contactless card payment limit in shops will increase by £15 to £45 as part of measures to combat coronavirus, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has announced.It is hoped the move will reduce the spread of the disease, as more casual transactions are carried out without having to use money potentially covered in bacteria.The BRC, which represents all UK retailers, said the change will lessen the need for contact with devices- such as card machines- where people are required to input their pin.The new contactless limit will become operational across certain stores in the UK from April 1, before it is rolled out nationallyRetailers currently operating at peak capacity due to high consumer demand may take longer to change their systems.The decision to raise the limit follows similar increases in several other European countries, including Germany, over the past week.Andrew Cregan, Head of Payments Policy at the BRC, said: “The last contactless limit increase to £30 took two years to implement but, given the extraordinary circumstances we face today, this new £45 limit will be rolled out from next week.“Some shops will take longer to make the necessary changes, given the strain they\u0027re under. In the meantime, most customers can continue to make contactless payments for higher amounts using their smartphone.”By the end of the decade, coins and notes could account for just one in ten transactions, according to a Government-commissioned study published last month.This trend has accelerated since the outbreak of the coronavirus, with more businesses switching to “cash-free operations” at their sites amid hygiene concerns.Costa Coffee and Ted Baker are among the high street stores which have said they are going to start only accepting contactless payments.The World Health Organisation has yet to issue specific recommendations on the use of cash in relation to Covid-19.It has suggested, however, that bank notes can carry high levels of germs, posing a risk of infection more generally.According to research by the London politan University, £5 and £10 polymer notes already in circulation hold eight types of bacteria, including listeria, between them.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/health-fitness/2020/03/11/TELEMMGLPICT000227560109_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?i","title":"coronavirus qa dos donts self isolation","story":"Dan Capurro has first-hand experience of self-isolation and will be answering your questionsPandemics and epidemicsBoris Johnson has taken the enormous step of placing the entire country in a strict lockdown. Members of the public will only be allowed to leave their homes for one of four specific reasons. To shop for essentials. To assist the vulnerable. For work, only if it is absolutely necessary. And once a day only to exercise or walk your dog. Gatherings of more than two people from different households are also banned.The measures are initially for just three weeks, but it seems likely that they will be extended.  I’m The ’s Front Bench Editor (you can sign up for my newsletter here) and at 1 p.m. (GMT) and I’ll be answering your questions this afternoon on the lockdown, it’s implications and the thinking behind itLeave your questions in the comments section at the bottom of this article ahead of our next Q\u0026ampA. Alternatively, if you are reading this on the  app, or don’t have a  account, you can submit a question by emailing yourstory@telegraph. If you would like to remain anonymous, please disclose this when you ask your question.An anonymous reader writes: I’m a clinician working in a hospital in central London, but live quite far outside the M25. I’m already planning to drive in for my shifts due to trains being cancelled, but I’m worried about what will happen if the city is placed on lockdown.If I’m on duty at the time when a lockdown is announced, will I receive enough notification to be able to get back out of London and home again? I have caring responsibilities outside of work.A: The Government has been clear that it does not plan to close down public transport or roads precisely because it would stop key workers from getting to their jobs. Michael Gove has discussed a more stringent lockdown which would require those moving around to have paperwork, but in such circumstances your job would entitle you to move freely.J Marchant has got in touch to ask: Please could someone ask how this is supposed to work: the children are off school and entitled to free school meals but parents are expected to go to the school daily to get a packed meal for them. How is this self isolation?A: Social-distancing is about keeping contact with others to the minimum level possible. Self-isolation is for those who are in a household where they or someone else has experienced symptoms.  Those self-isolating should not leave home, even to shop. If your household is self-isolating, you should ask if a friend or contact can help in dropping the lunches at your doorstep.Otherwise, you should be ok to collect the lunches from the school, so long as you stay at distance of two metres from members of other households. A similar question from Peter Thomas: Can we use the car to get to the place we choose to have our daily walk? A: Again, the Government advice does not specify, but please use common sense. You should not be driving more than a very short distance and certainly not, as some have done, to far away national parks. Ask yourself the following questions: can I park my car without coming into close contact with others? Will the area I go for my walk be quiet enough that I can avoid close contact with others? Will my driving require me to stop at a petrol station and interact with others? If I have the virus and do not realise, will I be spreading it to another community? If at all possible, it is best to walk nearby, but preserving your mental and physical health is important.Graham Price has emailed in to ask: When I retired 9 years ago I found it too easy to stay in the house so bought myself a breed of dogs that needs a lot of exercise (working cocker iel) i.e. at least an hour off the lead. I drive (within the area in which I live) a short distance and walk them in open countryside once a day. My question is am I exceeding the limits of being allowed to exercise by driving that distance?A: The Government advice does appear to differentiate between driving and walking for journeys. The key thing here is your social contacts. As I mentioned in a previous answer, being in the countryside and well away from other people or in a car that is not used by those outside your household, would not put you in breach of social distancing measures. The key thing, as in all cases, is to eliminate close contact with those outside your household and limit your trips to the bare minimum. You should also not be travelling more than a short distance. (P.S. That’s a lovely breed of dog, I grew up with one.)D Lawson emails: My partner and I are in the at-risk group and obliged to self-isolate for 3 months. To preserve our sanity, we would like to go for a drive in the car occasionally.  We would not get out of the car at all Would that be regarded as safe?A: The Government advice to those shielding is that: “you are strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid any face-to-face contact”, with the exception of carers and those providing essential support. That being said, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Jenny Harries said on Sunday that they did not want to “grow mental health problems” and that a a relatively fit 70 year old going outside “for an hour” would be “relatively safe” so long as they abided by other social-distancing measures including staying two metres away from others.  While what you describe with your car sounds acceptable, so long as no one from outside your household uses the car in between, bear in mind that this could be a problem if you need to use a petrol station, as you shouldn\u0027t be visiting public places, or if you were to break down and need assistance. A walk may be better. Diane Tutt says: Please can you tell me how long am I able to walk my dog, I don’t have a garden and she is used to long walks. A: The Government has not specified how long you can walk your dog, but the onus is on you to be sensible. If you live in the countryside and can walk your dog for an extended period of time without coming into close contact (two metres) with people from outside your household then that is likely to be ok. If, however, you live in a town or urban area you should think carefully about how, when and where you walk your dog and whether it is essential that it get such long walks. Whatever the case, do not use it as an opportunity to socialise and maintain a safe distance from those outside your household.Pandemics and epidemicsThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

On Monday evening it was also announced that people should only leave their homes to go to work where it is absolutely necessary. But who is classed a key worker?The Department of Education has published a full list of roles that the Government considers to be “key”.So here’s what we know so far.Key workers are people whose jobs are vital to public health and safety during the coronavirus lockdown. Because their work is so vital, the Government is keen to ensure that they are able to carry out their jobs with as little restriction as possible. This includes being able to put their children in school and use necessary transport links.Food chain workers, including those involved in production, processing, distribution, sale and delivery of goods.Postal workers, those required to run the justice system, religious staff, as well as those responsible for managing the deceased, and journalists providing public service broadcasting.Local and national government workers in admin roles “essential to the effective delivery” of the Covid-19 response or delivering essential public services, including payment of benefits.Police and support staff, Ministry of Defence civilian staff and armed forces personnel, fire and rescue staff, and workers responsible for border security, prisons and probation.No, they should be at home and observing social distancing.Vulnerable children, including those with a social worker, and pupils who get special needs support will be able to stay in school. Children with at least one parent or carer who are identified as critical workers by the government can send their children to school if required.Single parents who are key workers will be entitled to a school place.Some roles within the NHS, such as dental nurse, whose work is not at the frontline of treating the coronavirus may still be considered key workers. However, this may depend on your practice and the type of work you do.Clearly, there is a grey area over key workers, and it may be hard to enforce restrictions if children of non-key workers are still turning up at school. But the Government is asking people, in extraordinary times, to do everything they can to protect as many lives as they can. If you do not need to take your child to school because your job is not essential to public health and safety, please try to stay at home.The Government is not intending to restrict access to the transport system, though there are a number of closures, particularly in London. However, if you are not a key worker, try to avoid travelling by public transport.Not only does this free up space for vital workers, but you are less likely to catch and spread the virus. If you can, walk or cycle to work. If you don\u0027t need to travel, don\u0027t.A Downing Street spokesman said employees should speak to their employers to check whether they should come into work if they are unsure whether they are a key worker. Employees should speak to their employers. People who can work from home should, but those who are central to the coronavirus effort, we believe, have been named as key workers, they said. The spokesman said the Department for Education had been working closely with the Office for National Statistics in compiling the list of key workers, but could not say how many children were expected to turn up at school next week.Earlier in the day, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary said that under 20 per cent of children will be in school, and that the scientific advice still stands that operating at that level will still be overwhelmingly effective in slowing the spread.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"supermarkets take action ensure social distancing staff prepare","story":"Supermarkets have taped off areas in store and put up protective screens for staff after worrying pictures at the weekend showed shoppers crammed together in queues to buy food.After the Prime Minister ordered a UK-wide lockdown, some of the only shops are open are those which sell food. In order to stop the spread of coronavirus and temper crowds, shops across the country have put queueing rules in place.There are also discussions going ahead about pre-picking a weekly shop to reduce the number of people in the aisles as home delivery slots are still scarce. Other supermarkets are asking for the contactless spend limit to be raised to £45.Here is what each supermarket is doing to increase social distancing.The supermarket is allowing fewer people than usual in store. Those who are in shops will see tape marking out the correct distance to stand behind or in front of the next person in the queue.Staff will also be given plastic screens at tills for protection.They will will be closing every other payment point in supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol filling stations.The supermarket is also asking customers to use cards at tills and cash at self-service checkouts where they can.The upscale supermarket has introduced new two-metre marshalls in stores who will tell customers to stand at a greater distance from each other.It is also limiting customer numbers, introducing ‘safe distance’ floor signage, installing protective screens at checkouts, putting in place additional security and encouraging contactless shopping.Shop managers will use their judgment on customer numbers and when the shop is at capacity to manage social distancing will operate a one in, one out policy. Waitrose will still dedicate the first opening hour to elderly and vulnerable customers and those caring for them and NHS staff will continue to be given priority checkout service.There will also be fewer checkouts. In order to enable those working in the shop to maintain social distancing where two checkouts are back to back one will close.Special protective visors are also being ordered and will be available to staff if they wish. New lift instructions stating that only one customer or family should occupy a lift at any one time.A drive to encourage more customers to shop in a “cashless and contactless” way to prevent unnecessary contact.  Staff will guide customers where possible to use Waitrose Quick Check self-service technology and contactless card payments. Waitrose \u0026amp Partners is also part of discussions to increase the contactless limit to £45 to help customers make more use of contactless payment.The shop has put protective screens in place to protect staff from infected droplets.It has also put together essential \u0027food boxes\u0027 in order to reduce the amount of contact people have with others. These cost £35 for a family and a vegetarian option can also be ordered. They contain meat, eggs, pasta, vegetables and other staples.Tesco has put tape on the floor of its shops to demonstrate safe distances at which to stand and is limiting the number of people allowed in shops.To allow staff to rest and stock to be replenished, all store daily opening hours will shorten slightly to close at 8pm every day, from this Friday until further notice.  Clear screens will be installed at all Aldi checkouts in the UK to protect colleagues and customers.  Aldi is also advising its colleagues and customers to observe Government advice on social distancing in stores.Lidl will install checkout protection screens across all its stores in Great Britain. Christian Härtnagel, CEO at Lidl GB, commented: “The safety of our colleagues and customers continues to be a key priority for us, which is why all of our stores here in Great Britain will be fitted with protection screens at checkouts.“We hope that this additional safeguard will help to provide extra reassurance for those both working and shopping in our stores.”Last week, the supermarket announced that it was creating up to 2,500 new store jobs to provide necessary additional support to its workforce and customers.The wholesaler has put cones in place to enforce socially-distant queuing and has limited the numbers of those allowed in store.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"supporters draconian action must bear mind unintended effects","story":"My family is lucky, in this crisis and in this weather, to live in the country. From our house is a wide view across a river, with fields and woods rising the other side. The woods are at that lovely moment when the trees are budding but not yet in leaf, so one can see the forest floor beneath as it greens up faster than the canopy above.As I lay on the lawn yesterday, reading stories about panic-buyers and people who are not obeying the rules of social distancing, I recalled the line in the hymn about a place where “Every prospect pleases and only man is vile”.As I watched, however, a dozen fallow deer, frightened by something in the larger wood, broke out of it and galloped across the field towards the copse beyond. As the deer approached it, something alarmed them there too. They froze, and then started turning back and forth indecisively. After a bit, as if by joint reflection, the herd calmed down and moved, in slow and orderly fashion, into the second wood.It struck me that most of the human herd is behaving a bit like those deer at present. It is not evidence that we are vile. We shouldn’t be blaming each other too readily. It is simply that it takes a bit of working out how to answer need and avoid danger. Take “panic-buying”. Yes, a few greedily grab great piles of stuff, but most of us buy more of something which we believe might become short (hence the old slogan “Hurry, hurry – while stocks last”). That is not wrong.Take the failure to maintain social distance last weekend. It is entirely natural, and healthy, to seek space to take the air. As an inidual decision, given the current need for psychological refreshment, it is even positively good. The problem arises when lots of iniduals independently make the same decision. A beautiful National Trust park usually affords lots of room, but if you arrive there in the time of Covid-19 and find the car park crowded, you have unwittingly added to a health hazard. Morally, it is like being in a traffic jam – each driver stuck in one is not usually blameworthy for being there.It is easy to see how people who crowded into parks, such as those pictured here in Richmond Park, unwittingly contributed to a health hazardLast night, Boris Johnson announced a much fiercer clampdown to deal with these difficulties. The public are now extremely restricted in where they can go. His argument is one from dire necessity, and it would be bold to say it is wrong. But those calling for draconian action also need to remember its unintended effects. If, for example, the Government had suddenly “locked down” London last week – as was rumoured – such a measure would itself have caused chaos. It could have turned hundreds of thousands of people into refugees, overcrowding road and trains, increasing infection risks as it did so.The Government sensibly did not close the city. With these latest restrictions, there must be a real danger that people will find them impossible, get disillusioned and defy them. The difficulties in care homes, for example, are now truly formidable. So is the situation of parents whose children are unexpectedly home all day.We, the herd, do need guidance, but if we become blindly dependent on rigid orders, we might panic blindly too.The wartime comparison with the coronavirus does not work in every way. But in one respect, it does. Unlike in normal politics, there has to be an overriding common purpose. Does it make sense, therefore, to form a coalition government, as some are beginning to suggest? Given the urgent need to beat the virus, does the normal, legitimate role of the Opposition disappear? Would it help national unity if the Labour Party were sharing responsibility and decisions?Jeremy Corbyn should certainly not have any role. As the defeated, outgoing leader, he no longer has a personal mandate. It might not be idiotic, however, for Mr Corbyn’s successor – most likely Sir Keir Starmer – to be treated differently.The analogy with the coalition government formed under Winston Churchill in 1940 is inexact. In that case, the existing Conservative government had failed in its war aims, and there had not been a general election since 1935. Churchill had a moral duty and a political need to cast the net wider. In 2020, the Tory majority is new and robust.Nevertheless, it might be good to find some way to bring the Opposition in on what is happening for the duration of the crisis. It could be slightly informal, given that the duration (unlike the Second World War) will probably be a matter of months, not years.If Boris Johnson were to invite Sir Keir (or whoever) to join the fight rather than stand on the sidelines, it would be a big gesture. The risk would be that it would split Labour – and therefore the new leader would probably refuse. Labour’s gain by accepting, however, would be that, at a stroke, it would have shown itself to be a party capable of government once more.The coincidence of the virus biting and the spring coming leads me to take deeper delight than usual in how the season changes. On Sunday afternoon, our dog turned over on her back and wriggled herself luxuriously down the grassy slope for the first time this year. For us, this is normally just a pleasingly comic moment of spring. This year, it felt touchingly hopeful.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

And these measures are in place for three weeks starting immediately.Police will have power to issue on the spot fines of £30 for meeting without good reason.Takeaway and delivery services may remain open and operational and online retail is still open and encouraged. Postal and delivery service will run as normal.Retail and public premises remaining open must:The Government has ordered all of the businesses in the table below to close, unless there are exceptions, which are all listed. There is some uncertainty about businesses not listed, such as building sites. The emergency piece of legislation is wide-ranging, and you can read it in its entirety below, but here are the key points: From Friday 20 March, schools and nurseries will be closed until further notice, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said.But in order for key workers to get to work, schools had to remain open in order for their children to be cared for.The Government published a list of key workers in the early hours of Friday whose children will continue to be cared for at school amid the coronavirus pandemic.But there has been chaos in schools with beauticians and museum staff arriving claiming to be key workers while firefighters and microbiologists were turned away.The Prime Minister said that exams would not go ahead in May and June, meaning GCSEs, A-levels and SATs are on hold, but the aim is for children to get their results in the summer possibly using their predicted grades.Supermarkets up and down the country have seen scenes of apocalyptic panic buying (see video below).Britons have been told not to panic buy and shop as they would normally shop.But, people were ignoring the advice as queues snaked around supermarket car parks, so supermarkets have introduced rationing on grocery products. The hysteria has prompted some chains to introduce elderly and vulnerable-only shopping slots.Shoppers will also be limited to a maximum of three of any grocery product and a maximum of two on the most popular items such as toilet roll, soap and UHT milk.The Government has made assurances that shops\u0027 supplies will remain fully stocked and under the new emergency Coronavirus Bill, supermarkets would be forced to tell ministers about any supply chain issues.If people must leave their homes to purchase food, they should limit social contact with other people, the Government said. And some chains like Waitrose have introduced a maximum number of people allowed inside at any given time.Areas of close social contact such as pubs and clubs are high-risk areas for transmission of the virus. Ministers will be able to prohibit or restrict events and gatherings, and to close premises, if the public health situation deems it necessary the notes to the Bill say.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has placed quite a hefty emphasis on limiting smaller gatherings to counter the spread of the virus.Restaurants also fall into this category and a number of chains - including McDonald\u0027s, Costa Coffee and Nando\u0027s - who had been offering a take-away only service closed their doors indefinitely ahead of the Prime Minister\u0027s announcement.Dozens of stations on the London Underground network have been closed following the outbreak of Covid-19.Transport for London says the plans were designed to allow critical workers to make essential journeys and will see up to 40 stations which do not interchange with other lines closed on the Tube network.Here is the full list of the closures: Buses in the capital will be reduced and people are being urged not to use public transport for anything other than essential journeys and the Waterloo and City line and Night Tube services will not run from Friday.London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: I\u0027m urging Londoners to only use public transport for essential journeys. Everyone should follow this and the other advice to help keep themselves and each other safe.But this advice was not being adhered to, as the Tube, buses and trains were still packed on the first morning of the lockdown.TfL said it would also be gradually reducing the frequency of services across the network, to provide a service for critical workers to get to where they need to - ensuring that remaining services are not overcrowded.Grant Shapps, Secretary of State for Transport, has previously hinted railway services could be axed because there was no point running ghost trains.The Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced that the Government will underwrite the entire nation\u0027s wage bill. Anyone who cannot work because of the coronavirus pandemic will be paid 80 per cent of their salary by the Government, capped at £2,500 per month, under an unlimited rescue package unprecedented in the history of the British state.Mr Sunak also announced four major financial pledges. Government-backed loans worth £330billion - equivalent to 15 percent of GDP - will be made available to support businessesExtending the business rates holiday to all businesses in the hospitality sector and funding grants of up to £25,000 for smaller businessesThree-month mortgage holiday, meaning those affected by coronavirus will not pay a penny towards their mortgageOn Tuesday, Mar 17, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said British citizens were advised against non-essential foreign travel for 30 days.That refers to anywhere outside the UK.In a Commons statement, he told MPs: Based on the fast-changing international circumstances today I am announcing changes to FCO (Foreign and Commonwealth Office) travel advice.UK travellers abroad now face widespread international border restrictions and lockdowns in various countries.The FCO will always consider the safety and the security of British nationals so with immediate effect I\u0027ve taken the decision to advise British nationals against non-essential travel globally for an initial period of 30 days and of course subject to ongoing review.A mass gathering in the UK is considered to be a meeting of more than two people - unless they are from the same household.This means that going to a family member\u0027s home for a Sunday roast is now banned.Big events such as elite sport and concerts have long been abandoned.  People classed as vulnerable have been told to drastically change the way they live their lives by social distancing. The Government is strongly advising them to significantly limit your face-to-face interaction with friends and family if possible.Those who fall into this category are: Underlying health issues can be largely defined by anyone who is instructed to get a flu jab as an adult each year on medical grounds, according to the Department of Health.These conditions are set out in the box below.Pregnant women are the most recent group to be added to the list, although the Government has stressed this is purely a precautionary measure as experts are early in our understanding of this virus.Although the limited evidence suggested there were no complications in pregnancy, for many infectious diseases there is a small but appreciable additional risk and as this was a new virus there was no evidence for people in early stages of pregnancy.Infections and pregnancy are not a good combination in general and that is why we have taken the very precautionary measure while we try and find out more, the Government\u0027s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said, adding that he would rather be overly cautious at this stage and admit it was overkill at a later date than underplay it and get it wrong.Those considered extremely vulnerable have been told to shield themselves from society for 12 weeks. Around 1.5million people were written to to inform them they are part of this group and should not leave their homes until at least Monday, June 15.Social distancing is staying 2 metres away from anybody you do not live with. The Government has set out measures you can take to reduce the social interaction between people. This will help reduce the transmission of coronavirus.Everyone should be trying to follow these measures as much as is pragmatic, the Government said, and the advice is likely to be in place for some weeks.Anybody with coronavirus symptoms - a new, persistent cough or a fever - should self-isolate.Those living alone should do so for seven days, but those living with others should self-isolate as a household for 14 days. Where possible - this should mean not leaving the home at all, and getting groceries delivered to the property.Criminal trials are to be put on hold as part of the ongoing efforts to delay the spread of coronavirus.In a statement, it was announced that the Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett - the most senior judge in England and Wales - has decided no new trial should start in any Crown Court unless it is expected to last for three days or fewer.As a result, cases longer than three days that were due to start before the end of April will be postponed.The announcement came after pressure mounted on the Government to make clear its strategy for courts, amid growing concerns about the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on court business.The statement said the impact of the public health emergency on the operation of the courts has been under constant review, and that criminal trials pose particular problems in a fast-moving situation because of the involvement of many participants including the judge, jurors, defendants, lawyers, witnesses and court staff.All cinemas and theatres are now closed.The move comes after theatres in the West End and around the UK closed.The Society Of London Theatre - which represents hundreds of theatres in the capital including the National Theatre, London Palladium and London Coliseum - and UK Theatre said the decision was not taken lightly.The Royal Shakespeare Company also announced its three theatres will close following the Government\u0027s advice.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/22/18/coronavirus-shops.jpg","title":"coronavirus primark shops closed shut hmv john lewis new look","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.More than 37,000 staff affected by latest move to slow down spread of Covid-19Primark announced it will close all 189 of its stores as retailers across the UK began locking down in an attempt to slow the spread of coronavirus.The fast-fashion business said the measure would affect some 37,000 staff but committed to paying employees their contracted hours for the next 14 days.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt came as a host of other high street shops, including John Lewis, HMV, Topshop\u0026nbspand New Look, also announced they were closing stores.Online shopping websites will not be affected by the shutdown.The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government’s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus -- and where has it spread?Arcadia Group, the company that owns fashion brands including Topshop, Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Miss Selfridge, had already closed its stores “until further notice” from 4pm on Friday.“All store staff remain employees during this time and will be paid their normal pay for March plus any outstanding overtime payments, after which we will review this situation and will be keeping our store teams updated,” the firm said in a statement.Ikea shut its 22 UK stores the same day, along with TK Maxx, Clarks and several other brands.New Look closed its stores at 5pm on Saturday and said it had extended its refund policy to 90 days.

However, her contract did not guarantee any hours each week.The job was her sole source of income, as it was for a number of now unemployed colleagues. The university had decided that all “non-essential parts of its business” would be closed down, the message informed them.The university says it\u0026nbsphas received “assurances” from Aramark that all staff will continue to be paid through the Covid-19 closure. Aramark promised to pass on further information when it could, but a week later nothing has materialised. Aramark did not respond to requests for comment.The situation highlights a lacuna in the government’s jobs support package. Last week, the chancellor said the government would, for the first time in Britain’s history, step in to pay private sector wages. The move means state grants will cover up to 80 per cent of salaries for workers “furloughed” –\u0026nbspon a company’s payroll but temporarily not needed for work.The idea is that once Covid-19 is under control and trade picks up again, those employees can start working without having to go out and find a new job.It has been welcomed by unions and workers but the scheme only applies where companies decide to take it up.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailRishi Sunak said on Friday that workers on zero-hours contracts would be covered, as long as they were paid through PAYE. But many of these workers have simply been let go en masse in any case. Self-employed workers, who are not on PAYE, are not covered at all and will have to claim benefits if their work dries up and no new government measures are enacted.Powell says she will not be able to pay rent this month, nor will several former colleagues.“I’ve applied for universal credit but it’s a five-week wait at the outset. They’re trying to make it faster but I don’t know if that’s likely to happen given the entire hospitality industry is probably knocking on their door right now.“I’m feeling pretty grim about it. It’s a bit dismaying. The silver lining that’s come out of it is that we’ve all really come together as a workforce, everyone who works at the bar.“We’ve got nothing to lose now so we’re all ready to fight to be paid through the closure.”They are taking the fight to the University with the help of the Independent Workers\u0027 Union of Great Britain (IWGB) to demand they are paid throughout the shutdown for the hours they\u0027ve been working over the past three months.More details on government support for zero-hours workers will be revealed “shortly”, the chancellor said last week. Further support is also expected to be forthcoming for the self-employed. For Powell and others in her position, the clarification cannot come soon enough.Coronavirus poses a slightly different, but no less daunting, problem for Sandra Tochez, a cleaner at University of London.Until Friday, she cleaned the university’s Senate House building for three hours every weekday morning. In the afternoon, she made her way over to the halls fo residence to clean. Then she was told not to come in.She says that the outsourcing company that employs her, Cordant, told her and several other cleaners that they would only be paid for their “contracted” hours.For Tochez, that meant just the three hours in the morning, so her pay had more than halved. If Tochez had been furloughed under the government’s scheme, she would have received 80 per cent of her pay for three months.She had been fighting for two years to have the four hours she works every afternoon to be recognised on her contract rather than classified as “overtime”. She says Cordant has refused.Cordant disputes Tochez’s account and\u0026nbspsays: “All staff across our business will continue to be paid for their contractual hours as well as any overtime worked.”This gives little comfort to Tochez and the other cleaners.“We are all extremely worried as we all have debts to pay and this money is not going to be enough to make the payments,” she says.“We are all thinking, ‘how are we going to manage, how are we going to pay rent?’”“It’s just not acceptable that they do this to people who have been working there for such a long time.”Millions of self-employed and gig economy workers who at present have even less financial support if they can\u0027t work during the pandemic.Greg Howard, a rider for food delivery service Deliveroo, says his recent decision to self-isolate cost him around £400 a week.\u0026nbspIt is stressful. I don\u0027t know how long this situation is going to go on for, nobody does. It does put a bit of fear and a bit of trepidation in me, says Howard.Deliveroo has set up a hardship fund for its riders who cannot work but there have been problems accessing it because riders must provide a doctor\u0027s note. The government announced in the Budget that workers could obtain one via the NHS\u0027 111 helpline but this service is not yet available.With millions of people now in enforced isolation, drivers involved in food distribution are recognised as crucial for the functioning of the economy but many feel they do not have the support they need.Courier services often do not employ staff directly but treat them as independent contractors, leaving the onus on the inidual to ensure they are safe, well and not at risk of spreading the virus.\u0026nbspRiders are doing all they can to protect themselves and others but they are being put in a difficult position, as Howard explains: Deliveroo have announced they will fund up to £20 the purchase of hand sanitisers, hand gels, soap, that kind of thing. We can\u0027t get hold of that, nobody can get hold of that.He believes that Deliveroo has been better at helping riders through the coronavirus crisis so far than some other gig economy companies, but there is much more to do.Alex Marshall, 35, couriers \u0026amp logistics branch chair of the IWGB union, is pushing for firms to cover riders\u0027 pay if they can\u0027t work.He adds: These companies need to take some responsibilities for workers that really could be integral to society to keep moving forward in these really troubling times.They can\u0027t continue to just say that these people are self-employed and totally in control of their own sanitising and everything. That responsibility is too much for one guy on his motorbike with a box on the back.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We’ve gathered together our favourite apps that cover everything from arts and crafts, to teaching kids how to code.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis app manages to make learning maths as fun as a bedtime story, using everything from electric eels to rollercoasters to help children figure their way through tricky problems.Ranging from ‘Wee Ones’ to ‘Big Kids’, Bedtime Math offers 1,600 exercises to suit kids from nursery through to primary school. The free app even has a ‘Sky’s the Limit’ challenge the mode, which will even test grown-ups.A peer-reviewed study from 2015 showed this app gave pupils the equivalent of a three-month advantage over their peers over the course of a school year, while also helping parents with their own “math anxiety”.The best learning tools are the ones that teach children vital skills without them even realising it. Erase All Kittens fits this exactly, introducing children aged 8-13 how to code through an epic kitten-saving adventure.The multi-award winning game is designed to teach professional programming skills, with a particular emphasis on inspiring girls to code.It uses gameplay similar to popular platform games like Mario and Sonic to provide a gentle introduction to\u0026nbspcomputational thinking, making it particularly appealing to any tech-phobic kids.To advance through levels and save the kittens, players need to change the source code of the game using professional coding languages like HTML.\u0026nbspThis interactive journaling app helps children develop their literacy skills while\u0026nbspalso engaging their imagination and creativity.11 best kids’ toys 2020: Puzzles, games and crafts to entertain kids aIts creators describe Diary App as “positive screen time” and it provides an\u0026nbspinnovative way for young people to document their daily lives – even if most of each day is spent indoors.Children can draw or write about their days using virtual colouring pens and special effects tools, while being guided by their own personalised ‘Zappicon’ creature.All this without parents having to worry about in-app purchases or adverts.All parents will be familiar with Eric Carle’s\u0026nbspmuch-loved Very Hungry Caterpillar book, from which this artistic app takes its inspiration.Caterpillar Creative Play encourages children to draw, paint, colour, design and create using a range of templates, textures and canvases.It works a little bit like a child-friendly version of PhotoShop, introducing editing concepts like layers that allow users to create everything from collages to unique artwork.Compatible with Apple Pencil on iPad Pro, Children’s Technology Review listed this among the top 10 essential apps for a child’s first iPad.Based on the popular\u0026nbspProfessor Astro Cat book series, this app allows children to explore the solar system with the help of a jet-propelled cat.Fascinating space facts are woven into a fun storyline that feels a lot like reading a book.\u0026nbspIt can be as entertaining for adults as it is for children, featuring illustrations, animations and even quizzes to test how much you’ve learned along the way.Gus on the GoGus on the Go takes users on a “language learning adventure” with the help of a cartoon owl called – you guessed it – Gus.Available in 30 different languages, the app uses engaging graphics and animations to teach children basic words and phrases.Various games and challenges let players earn trophies along the way to keep them incentivised and motivated.The app has even begun offering users the chance to learn endangered languages, beginning with\u0026nbspIngush.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We’re having to go out and do some augmentation of networks... But right now the network is performing quite well.”His comments came after a series of outages in the US, UK and Europe related to the Covid-19 pandemic.Last week, major phone networks and internet providers in the UK suffered widespread outages and down time due to a significant increase in web traffic.The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government’s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?The issue is expected to worsen over the coming weeks, as containment measures intensify and more people stay at home playing online games or streaming shows and films on the internet. Schools across the UK have also shut down, meaning lessons will be carried out using remote working apps.In an effort to ease the burden on internet infrastructure, Amazon Prime, Netflix and YouTube all announced plans to reduce the quality of streaming on their platforms.Despite concerns of more outages, BT offered assurances on Friday that its broadband network has the capacity to cope with the surge in demand.“The UK is one of the world’s most advanced digital economies, so we overbuild our networks to compensate for our love of high-definition streaming content,” BT’s chief technology officer Howard Watson wrote in a blog post.“The Covid-19 outbreak is causing changes to the way our networks are being used. We’re monitoring those changes carefully to make sure we can respond rapidly if needed.”There have so far been more than 340,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world, resulting in close to 15,000 deaths.The sharpest rise in cases in recent days has been in the US, which overtook Spain, Germany, Iran, France and South Korea over the last week to be the third worst affected country behind China and Italy.More than 100 million Americans have been ordered to stay at home, with eight states currently under lockdown.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, her contract did not guarantee any hours each week.The job was her sole source of income, as it was for a number of now unemployed colleagues. The university had decided that all “non-essential parts of its business” would be closed down, the message informed them.The university says it\u0026nbsphas received “assurances” from Aramark that all staff will continue to be paid through the Covid-19 closure. Aramark promised to pass on further information when it could, but a week later nothing has materialised. Aramark did not respond to requests for comment.The situation highlights a lacuna in the government’s jobs support package. Last week, the chancellor said the government would, for the first time in Britain’s history, step in to pay private sector wages. The move means state grants will cover up to 80 per cent of salaries for workers “furloughed” –\u0026nbspon a company’s payroll but temporarily not needed for work.The idea is that once Covid-19 is under control and trade picks up again, those employees can start working without having to go out and find a new job.It has been welcomed by unions and workers but the scheme only applies where companies decide to take it up.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailRishi Sunak said on Friday that workers on zero-hours contracts would be covered, as long as they were paid through PAYE. But many of these workers have simply been let go en masse in any case. Self-employed workers, who are not on PAYE, are not covered at all and will have to claim benefits if their work dries up and no new government measures are enacted.Powell says she will not be able to pay rent this month, nor will several former colleagues.“I’ve applied for universal credit but it’s a five-week wait at the outset. They’re trying to make it faster but I don’t know if that’s likely to happen given the entire hospitality industry is probably knocking on their door right now.“I’m feeling pretty grim about it. It’s a bit dismaying. The silver lining that’s come out of it is that we’ve all really come together as a workforce, everyone who works at the bar.“We’ve got nothing to lose now so we’re all ready to fight to be paid through the closure.”They are taking the fight to the University with the help of the Independent Workers\u0027 Union of Great Britain (IWGB) to demand they are paid throughout the shutdown for the hours they\u0027ve been working over the past three months.More details on government support for zero-hours workers will be revealed “shortly”, the chancellor said last week. Further support is also expected to be forthcoming for the self-employed. For Powell and others in her position, the clarification cannot come soon enough.Coronavirus poses a slightly different, but no less daunting, problem for Sandra Tochez, a cleaner at University of London.Until Friday, she cleaned the university’s Senate House building for three hours every weekday morning. In the afternoon, she made her way over to the halls fo residence to clean. Then she was told not to come in.She says that the outsourcing company that employs her, Cordant, told her and several other cleaners that they would only be paid for their “contracted” hours.For Tochez, that meant just the three hours in the morning, so her pay had more than halved. If Tochez had been furloughed under the government’s scheme, she would have received 80 per cent of her pay for three months.She had been fighting for two years to have the four hours she works every afternoon to be recognised on her contract rather than classified as “overtime”. She says Cordant has refused.Cordant disputes Tochez’s account and\u0026nbspsays: “All staff across our business will continue to be paid for their contractual hours as well as any overtime worked.”This gives little comfort to Tochez and the other cleaners.“We are all extremely worried as we all have debts to pay and this money is not going to be enough to make the payments,” she says.“We are all thinking, ‘how are we going to manage, how are we going to pay rent?’”“It’s just not acceptable that they do this to people who have been working there for such a long time.”Millions of self-employed and gig economy workers who at present have even less financial support if they can\u0027t work during the pandemic.Greg Howard, a rider for food delivery service Deliveroo, says his recent decision to self-isolate cost him around £400 a week.\u0026nbspIt is stressful. I don\u0027t know how long this situation is going to go on for, nobody does. It does put a bit of fear and a bit of trepidation in me, says Howard.Deliveroo has set up a hardship fund for its riders who cannot work but there have been problems accessing it because riders must provide a doctor\u0027s note. The government announced in the Budget that workers could obtain one via the NHS\u0027 111 helpline but this service is not yet available.With millions of people now in enforced isolation, drivers involved in food distribution are recognised as crucial for the functioning of the economy but many feel they do not have the support they need.Courier services often do not employ staff directly but treat them as independent contractors, leaving the onus on the inidual to ensure they are safe, well and not at risk of spreading the virus.\u0026nbspRiders are doing all they can to protect themselves and others but they are being put in a difficult position, as Howard explains: Deliveroo have announced they will fund up to £20 the purchase of hand sanitisers, hand gels, soap, that kind of thing. We can\u0027t get hold of that, nobody can get hold of that.He believes that Deliveroo has been better at helping riders through the coronavirus crisis so far than some other gig economy companies, but there is much more to do.Alex Marshall, 35, couriers \u0026amp logistics branch chair of the IWGB union, is pushing for firms to cover riders\u0027 pay if they can\u0027t work.He adds: These companies need to take some responsibilities for workers that really could be integral to society to keep moving forward in these really troubling times.They can\u0027t continue to just say that these people are self-employed and totally in control of their own sanitising and everything. That responsibility is too much for one guy on his motorbike with a box on the back.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, Avengers Assemble still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all.  5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, Avengers Assemble still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions.

Developers would aim to allow organisations such as the UN\u0027s health agencies to share information more quickly, and to be able to speed up replies to commonly asked questions using tools such as automated responses.Facebook also said it would run an online hackathon with the aim of encouraging developers to build messaging solutions that address issues related to the coronavirus such as social distancing and access to accurate information.

These iniduals will not have a right to live in Britain after the deadline of June 2021, unless they successfully appeal the decision.The number remains proportionately small, as there have been nearly 3 million applications processed overall, but it marks a considerable jump from the previous monthly figures, when just seven people had been refused.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAt that point the refusals were all on the grounds of criminality, but most of the latest refusals were due to issues around eligibility –\u0026nbspusually because the applicant has been unable to provide the relevant\u0026nbspdocumentary\u0026nbspevidence.While the number is still proportionately low, campaigners have raised alarm at the sudden increase, and it is likely to prompt concern around difficulties more vulnerable people face when obtaining evidence.Charity helping children in care stay in UK has to stop taking casesEU settlement scheme delays leave people unable to get jobsNine out of 10 EU settlement scheme appeals successful, data showsWithout physical proof of our status, EU citizens like me live in fearThe Home Office said officials had made every attempt to obtain the necessary evidence before refusing applications, and that decisions to refuse were not taken lightly and signed off at a high level.Maike Bohn, co-founder of campaign group\u0026nbspthe3million, told The Independent she was concerned by the fact that while there had been no refusals on eligibility grounds before February 2020, there was now a sharp rise.“This is hard to explain. We urgently need more explanation from the Home Office as to why those cases have been refused,” she said. “It is concerning that as soon as the UK left the EU we see people being refused settled status.”Christopher Desira, immigration solicitor at Seraphus law firm, said there were likely to be more and more refusals beyond criminality grounds, which may worry a lot of people in uncommon family arrangements, which tend to be the most complex applications.\u0026nbspHe also raised alarm over the gaps in free outreach and advice services that are likely to form due to the coronavirus outbreak, which may cause problems for those receiving requests for further information from the Home Office, but not know how to respond, and called on the Home Office to pause any refusals until the emergency is over.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are our families and friends, our colleagues and carers. They must have the right to stay.\u0026nbspEven before the coronavirus crisis, we were warning that tens of thousands of EU citizens will be left without settled status when the Conservative government’s arbitrary deadline hits next year.“That would leave thousands of people effectively undocumented and at risk of eviction, detention and even deportation. It will be a new Windrush scandal on an even bigger scale.”The Home Office figures show that overall, there have been more than 3.34 million applications to the scheme up to the end of February 2020.Minister for future borders and immigration Kevin Foster said: “EU citizens have made huge contributions to our country. It’s good news over three million have now been granted status and will be able to continue to call the UK home for decades to come.”Tory MP admits EU settlement scheme sometimes \u0027doesn\u0027t work as well as we expect\u0027The department\u0026nbspsaid it had\u0026nbspa wide range of support was\u0026nbspavailable online, over the phone and in person to help EU citizens apply for settled status.Earlier this month, the department announced a further £8m of funding to award 57 charities to help vulnerable EU citizens apply, on top of £9m announced for the same cause last April.However many charities in receipt of the original funding said they had been forced to cut back on their services due to uncertainty as to whether the funding would continue beyond the month of March – accusing the Home Office of leaving the announcement until the “last minute”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People can be seen hanging laundry. Children play. One man eats noodles. Another smokes a cigarette.Chinese officials and some public health experts have credited the draconian confinement measures on a city of 11 million, and much of Hubei province, of which it is the capital, with slowing the spread of the disease and turning the tide of infection across China.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOther countries, including Iran, Italy and the United States, are struggling to manage their outbreaks.\u0026nbspBut even as the number of new reported cases stops in Wuhan, people in the city remain suspended in an isolated new normal.Residents are forbidden from venturing out of their homes even to buy food, which must be delivered.

However, China this week\u0026nbspreported no new domestic cases – meaning the strict isolation measures have been working.\u0026nbspBut the outbreak has also exacted an unquantifiable psychological toll on people in Wuhan as families cope with loss, children are unable to go to school or play outside, and livelihoods are imperilled as people can’t go to work.Reporting by\u0026nbspCarlos Garcia and Tony Munroe, ReutersNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These materials are provided in English and nine additional languages from affected areas, and are available at all international airports, ports and international train stations.“We are testing established arrangements already in place for caring for unwell people arriving at airports to make sure the system is ready locally. We are also providing guidance and briefing to staff, so they know what to expect and how best to respond.”Public Health Englands medical director, Prof Yvonne Doyle, said that washing hands with soap and water is more effective than wearing a face mask, although face masks are important for staff to use in hospitals when dealing with suspected cases.On March , Boris Johnson revealed the governments battle plan to tackle the spread of Covid-.During a press conference at No, the British Prime Minister said: The army is of course always ready as and when, but that is under the worst case scenario.Contingency plans are in place for anything from a mild pandemic through to a severe prolonged pandemic as experienced in  known as Spanish Flu.Police could also be told to switch their focus to only tackle serious crime  emergency services start to buckle under pressure."},{"url":null,"title":"can pets get coronavirus how look after dogs cats","story":"This has changed in recent weeks as TWO dogs from Hong Kong have contracted the virus, and one of the dogs have died from it.Experts have previously said that pets cannot contract coronavirus.Widespread advice has been given globally reassuring pet owners not to worry about their pets during the pandemic.But these guidelines are set to change as two dogs have contracted the virus in Hong Kong.In both cases, the dogs contracted the virus from its owner, the first dog that caught it-died just two days after being released from mandatory quarantine on February .The World Organisation for Animal Health has reiterated that there is no evidence to suggest pets can pass the virus to their owners.A Pomeranian in Hong Kong was found to have traces of Covid- after its owner was diagnosed with the new virus.The weak positive test simply means that a small piece of viral genome was detected in a sample, says vet Sarah Caddy, a clinical research fellow in viral immunology at the University of Cambridge.A test used to detect genetic material is a highly sensitive method of testing but is unable to tell whether coronavirus was replicating in the dog or whether the dog had simply licked contaminated surfaces in the home, she added.And Dr Jessica May, UK lead vet at video service FirstVet, explained: The most likely reason for the dog to have mildly positive results was due to breathing contaminated air from the owner.However, the dog was not showing clinical signs.In the US, IDEXX Laboratories Inc evaluated thousands of canine and feline specimens during validation of a new veterinary test system for the Covid- virus.The lab reported today that results echoed the current expert understanding that Covid- is primarily transmitted person-to-person and supports the recommendation against testing pets for the Covid- virus.For dogs or cats with respiratory problems, the experts recommendation is to contact a vet to test for more common respiratory pathogens.Jay Mazelsky, CEO of IDEXX Laboratories, said: Pets are important members of our family, and we want to keep them healthy and safe.Dr Jessica May has recommended pet owners should seek adviceyou fear that your pet is infected with a strain of coronavirus.To try and keep you and your pets safe, you should keep social distancing from others and follow any guidelines given by the RSPCA during coronavirus.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But there has to be some common sense.We must all do our best to follow the Government’s advice to leave a -metre gap between ourselves and the next person when outdoors.Yes, a bunch of irresponsible idiots think they’re invincible and are choosing to flout the rules. Flocking to beaches and parks to sunbathe in large groups is plainly not sensible.Despite dire warnings that we are only a fortnight behind Italy where so many have died, large numbers of people here are still not getting the message.Most Brits are keen to do what’s right.Butnot enough of us take heed then we face restrictions the like of which have never been seen before.The stakes really are that high.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.TO the thousands of retired doctors and nurses who answered the Government’s call to arms: The Sun salutes you.Instead of thanking their lucky stars that they escaped before the virus hit, these everyday heroes ed to the NHS front line to save lives.If the Government wants more to follow where these pioneers have led, it must make a superhuman effort to support them. Right now, that means getting each and every one of them the proper protective clothing they need.We understand that’s easier said than done: Supplies are limited. Butpressure and incentives are heaped on British manufacturers, we believe it’s possible.Our courageous and dedicated NHS workers are all that’s standing between us and this merciless virus.They must never be taken for granted.GOOD news is scarce right now. But it’s thereyou look hard enough.Venice canals are the clearest they’ve been in  years. Emissions of the planet-heating gas CO are falling sharply.And since Chinese energy producers cut down on burning fossil fuels, the country looks set to avoid thousands of deaths from air pollution.In Britain, community spirit is blossoming for the first time in decades.

In normal times, everyone is busy, at work all day.We rarely see even the lovely couple who live across the landing. The streets below teem with workers, always in a hurry.Now these streets are empty. Our neighbours stay indoors, self-isolating.But we still see each other more than ever before, on the way to supermarkets for Silver Hour or grabbing some fresh air. We stand well apart, chat about the only subject in town and exchange offers of help. The City of London has become a village again.We receive tip-offs about loo roll delivery times or surprise consignments of hand gel and wet wipes at the nearby ­pharmacy.WhatsApp support groups have sprung up, advising on contactless payment via online bank accounts or how to spend your time indoors. Laptops are a leline.A frail friend and neighbour politely declines my offer to pick up her prescription.“I’m inundated with calls,” she says. “Everyone’s so kind.”Not everything is so fraternal.There is real anger at the hoarders in our midst — at people like the couple who arrived home with trolleys piled high and a new freezer to store three months of food.The Sun picture of a ­Teesside shopper with  loo rolls hit a nerve, along with the scumbag who made £, selling them at £ each to pensioners.So did private cardiologist Dr Mark Ali, who — says The Sunday Times — made £.million in a week flogging coronavirus test kits for £ a go — three times the cost price.Most employers are doing the decent thing, using help from Chancellor Rishi Sunak to keep workers on  per cent pay.But others are seizing the chance to slash their payroll, risking a huge spike in ­unemployment once the crisis is over. Some household-name ­companies have not covered themselves with glory.EasyJet effectively abandoned passengers stuck in foreign parts with no way home until Sunak stuffed taxpayers’ cash down their throats.My we and I escaped from Cyprus last week on one of the last ­scheduled flights before hotels and airports were shut down.A lot of EasyJet over-s passengers feared being stranded with nowhere to stay.This crisis has hit Downing Street hard, with ministers and officials working -hour days, almost hot-bedding in No as they struggle to cope with fast-changing events.London, the UK epicentre of contagion, is in lockdown as the death toll spurts faster than tragic Italy’s at this stage of the spread. Did Boris get it right  We’ll soon know.It is interesting to observe the reaction of dferent age groups to this pandemic.Schoolchildren are understandably scared by the headlines. Old folk, some of them war babies, are more fatalistic.But some in their s and s are flagrantly ignoring advice to self-isolate.They are the least likely to die of this bug but risk putting thousands of fellow Brits in an early grave.A few months ago, the UK was split by what now seems a harmless spat over Brexit.There were Remainer black “jokes” that Britain would rejoin the EU once all we Brexit fogies had popped our clogs and the Eurosceptic virus had been eliminated.Covid- may be culling the elderly, but at least it’s impartial.They applaud their “friends” in Russia, China and others even more extreme who will take advantage of crippled Western economies, especially in Europe.Once we are through this pandemic, the next truly momentous battle will be between the West’s cash-strapped but creative “free spirits” and the authoritarian iron fists of the former Soviet era. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Best of luck to everyone in the same boat this morning. #homeschool #day.”Fellow parent Melanie Williams joked: “ per cent attendance at today’s #homeschool and the welcome assembly was lovely.”But not all home lessons went smooth for the millions who had to look after their children while also working from home.Mum Samantha Nixon wrote: “Teachers deserve much more credit! I didn’t realise how much until I had to #homeschool my two children.”One parent asked “How are teachers not alcoholics ” while a stressed-out dad got his golf clubs out for a “PE lesson” with his son in the back garden.Another, Rori Fett, joked: “Day one of the schools closing and home-schooling beginning. Kids have been expelled and I’m taking early retirement. What time is wine o’clock ”James DeVaney added: “Anyone working from home with kids still think teachers are paid appropriately ”Naomi Seal posted: “Day  of homeschooling. We both cried before lunch.”Some schools offered online lessons for their pupils to follow at home, including Truro High, an independent establishment in Cornwall for girls.Headmistress Sarah Matthews said: “Our priority will be to ensure that the quality of learning does not change.“We do not simply want the girls to maintain their standards over the coming weeks and months. We want them to be stretched, to complete their curriculum coursework as planned and to continue to make excellent progress.”Despite millions staying at home after last week’s announcement by PM Boris Johnson, children of designated “key workers” are still allowed to go to school as normal. However school leaders said most parents had heeded advice from the Education Secretary Gavin Williamson to send their children in onlyit was absolutely necessary. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, paid tribute to classroom staff for calmly adapting to the coronavirus crisis.He said: “Schools are reporting that the number of pupils arriving is manageable. We are grateful to parents for their understanding.“We would like to pay tribute to schools for their amazing work in organising this provision so quickly. They have calmly gone about the business of identying children who need places, arranging staffing cover, and providing learning resources for children who are at home. It has been an exemplary exercise in superb leadership.”Parents were also warned to remain vigilant to the dangers of their children spending more time online.Child safety online organisation Internet Matters said parents should check that their children’s devices have age-appropriate settings in place — and implement screen time limits as part of their new routine.Carolyn Bunting, the group’s chief executive, said: “As parents, we are all facing uncharted territory amid the coronavirus pandemic as we try to navigate work, schooling and our children’s well-being.“Tech provides many fantastic opportunities at this time, giving children additional tools to learn, create, socialise and a place to have their downtime. However, as a child’s screen time increases, so does their chances of facing online risks.”She warned: “It’s essential that parents do not become complacent about their child’s digital world and the harms they could be facing online, which could include everything from seeing inappropriate content to having unwanted contact from strangers.”To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Go to thesun drhilary to ask yours or simply use the form below.Britain’s most respected doctor will also be answering questions in an online Q and A session with The Sun’s Executive Editor Dan Wootton from ­Wednesday at youtube thesunnewspaper.Today he tackles some of the most common ­questions about ­coronavirus.Q: I think I might have corona­virus, should I go to my GP or call   A: Neither. If you have symptoms that are typical of the virus, you should stay at home and self-isolate. We are asking people not to contact  or to go to see their GP as these services are currently very stretched. Drink plenty of ­fluids, take paracetamol and get plenty of rest.Q: I suspect I have coronavirus, should I get tested A: At the moment testing is only reserved for seriously ill patients in critical care in hospital, those admitted to hospital with respiratory infections and for healthcare workers, such as doctors, nurses and paramedics. We don’t have enough tests for everyone and evenwe did, it would not change the way most people are treated.Q: If I suspect I have coronavirus, should I inform everyone I’ve been in close contact with  A: You only need to inform people who you have been in contact withyou have been admitted to hospital and are confident, via testing, that you have the virus.Q: Should I wear a mask, scarf or gloves to protect myself  A: Psychologically you may feel safer behind a mask or scarf but there is no evidence to suggest this stops the virus being spread. Many are suitable for dust and pollution but the virus particles are microscopic.In fact, some people might argue that you may touch your face moreyou are wearing a mask or scarf.If you use gloves on areas that could have become contaminated, such as an ATM or petrol pump, you will need to then throw those gloves away and this means you are going to get through an awful lot of gloves in one day.This is why it is important to wash hands thoroughly with soap and hot water or use hand sanitiser with a minimum of  per cent alcohol when you are out and about. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-GRAPHIC-P--.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\" A: Yes and no. Our natural instinct is to hug or embrace our loved ones andyou are all at home together and no one is showing any symptoms you can carry on as ­normal.Butsomeone in the ­family is self-isolating you must keep a physical distance. The same goes for elderly relatives or those in the at-risk group. You must keep your distance from them evenyou are not showing signs of having the virus.Q: If I have symptoms that aren’t typical of coronavirus, such as a runny nose, sore throat, tickly cough and headache, could I still have the virus A: Of the , tests that have been carried out on people with symptoms that could be corona­virus, more than , have proved negative, so most people don’t have the virus but still need to isolate just in case.Q: Is it safe to take ibuprofen while you have coronavirus A: Ibuprofen is a commonly used medicine that can be bought over the counter. But it is also an anti-inflammatory, which works by stopping inflammation in the body. With this virus, we don’t want to do that.The best response to the virus is to produce inflammation so the body can fight it. So it is better not to take ibuprofen but to use paracetamol instead to help bring down your temperature.Q: Will vitamin C help my body to fight the virus A: In theory it supports the immune system and won’t do any harm, but there is no strong evidence that taking even large doses of vitamin C makes much dference with this virus.It is important to eat a healthy and well-balanced diet as well as taking a vitamin D supplement, which is always useful in winter anyway. It’s important to also get out in the garden or on your balcony to absorb a few rays of sunshine, without burning.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Q: I have symptoms, but how do I self-isolate A: You need to stay indoors. If friends or family deliver food, they must leave it on the doorstep for you to bring in yourself. You will need to self-isolate for seven days.Butyou live with others, all members of your household will need to self-isolate for  days.You need to stay in your own room. You must eat your meals in that room and sleep alone. Use your own crockery and glassware and make sure you wash them up immediately after use. Clean hard surfaces after you have used them.Ideally you should use separate bathrooms. If you have to share a bathroom, you should use it last then wipe down surfaces with a bleach-based product. Use separate towels and toiletries.Keep a safe distance — a minimum of two metres — apart from other household members.Q: At what point should I seek medical advice A: If you are having breathing dficulties or chest pain which is getting worse, or your temperature is very high and not coming down with fluids and paracetamol, that is the time to seek further medical advice by phoning  or going on their website. If you are really breathless, phone  — but this is only for severe cases.Q: I have an outpatient appointment but should I avoid going to hospital A: If you don’t have symptoms and have an outpatient appointment, such as a scan, it is OK to go to hospital as long as you keep your distance from other people and leave the hospital as soon as your appointment is over.For those in the at-risk group, it is best to stay home. In both cases, contact your unit first and seek advice. If you have cancer, it is important to continue with treatment such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and those units will be more conscious than ever to isolate those patients when they come in and to get their treatment done quickly so they can get home as soon as possible.Q: Which people are classed as at-risk A: These are people who are ­normally advised to have the seasonal flu jab. They include those with underlying medical conditions. These include:Q: And who is classed as being high risk A: People in the high-risk group include those who have had an organ transplant and are taking immunosuppressants, currently ­having treatment for cancer and people with conditions such as HIV.Q: Is is possible to get corona­virus twice A: Currently we don’t know enough about this virus to say for sure that you can’t get it twice but it is unlikely.If it turns out to be like seasonal flu it’s possible there might be another round of virus next winter, as we don’t know yet how strong people’s immunity will be.We will know more in the future and soon a test will become available to show whether someone has had the virus and has developed immunity.Tap to see where COVID- is near you Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My body ached severely, I felt so heavy and was sweating with a fever.Things were not looking good. I struggled to sleep due to the intense body aches – I never felt anything like this before.Doctors have warned that a loss of taste or smell could also be a sign of coronavirus.The British Association of Otorhinolaryngology, which represents experts in ear, nose and throat medicine, has said that those who lose these senses should self-isolate immediately - evenyou have no other symptoms.They added that the eye infection conjunctivitis may also be another sign.In a statement, the docs said: Evidence from other countries that the entry point for the coronavirus is often in the eyes, nose and throat areas.We have also identied a new symptomthat may mean that people without other symptoms but with just the loss of this sense may have to self-isolate - again to reduce the spread of the virus.Its thought that losing the ability to smell or taste could be due to the virus destroying cells in the nose and throat.Experts say its something people can commonly experience after having other types of coronaviruses - such as the common cold.Prof Carl Philpott, of the Norwich Medical School at UEA, said: Coronaviruses have previously been associated with what we refer to as post-viral olfactory loss– this is smell loss that persists after a cold.There are many respiratory viruses that can potentially cause problems with the smell receptors.So far with Covid-, the smell loss appears to be transient but only as time elapses will we know how many people have a more permanent loss.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Ryan Van Waterschoot, who ended up in hospital for  days while he fought Covid-, is one of those who lost his sense of taste and smell.The -year-old said: I didn’t think I was going to make it out of the hospital. I thought it was the end of the road for me.Mr Van Waterschoot, of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, first felt unwell on March  when he lost his sense of taste and smell and, and went from feeling tired to not being able to move in just one day.As his condition worsened, he called the doctors and was immediately advised to call an ambulance on March .His temperature had soared and he was taken to Peterborough City Hospital where he was put on an isolation ward and needed oxygen for five days.He is now at home recovering but has warned people to stay at home and follow government advice.Some people may experience brain fog, also known as mental fatigue, as another symptom of coronavirus.Its not been officially looked into as a symptom but its another indicator that those who have experienced the illness have reported experiencing.Thea Jourdan, , said she didnt experience a cough or fever - instead her introduction to Covid- began with a tickle in her throat and a dull headache,.The mum-of-three, from Hampshire, says she then started to experience brain fog.She told the Daily Mail: Initially I felt exhausted, asI was dragging myself through treacle and had no choice but to go to my bed. I had no meaningful cough and I wasn’t running a fever.But I had a peculiar sensation of something settling deep within my lungs, almost like breathing in talcum powder. I also had brain fog. I was unable even to fill out forms from the children’s schools. I just wanted to sleep.Another woman, who had recently recovered from Covid-, told the Huffington Post that she too had experienced the unusual mental block before her symptoms worsened.Christy, from Seattle, said her illness started with a multi-day fever that progressed into sinus congestion, a headache and a debilitating “brain fog” that made it impossible to focus.She added: “It’s not just a cold.  I’m pretty healthy and not old , and it kicked my a**.”Another symptom that coronavirus patients have reported is feeling extremely fatigued before symptoms develop.According to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association, up to  per cent of those hospitalised with Covid- reported exhaustion and fatigue.Chiara DiGiallorenzo, , has been battling Covid- since March , said her illness started with a fever and fatigue.But she knew it was more serious than a flu when she developed a tightness in her chest that left her short of breath.Chiara, from Miami, told HuffPo: “It is not the flu,” adding that many people who get it are left “fighting for air.”Linda Carr, , from Hethersett, Norfolk, said that around a fortnight ago she lost her sense of taste and smell.She told the Mail she then developed other symptoms, adding: I felt very sick and terribly fatigued. But I didn’t have a temperature or a cough.Within two days I could barely stand. I didn’t have the energy to lt one foot in front of the other.It was only when she went to her GP to collect some unrelated blood tests that she had her temperature taken and was told it was so high she should go straight to hospital.She tested positive for Covid- and spent five days in hospital before being discharged.Linda says she is still feeling weak and remains in isolation at home.Those who develop minor symptoms such as a high temperature or continuous cough should self-isolate for seven days.If you live with others, you should also stay at home for  days from the day the first person started showing symptoms.Anyone with suspected coronavirus who becomes seriously ill should call  and in a medical emergency always call .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Our nation will never be the same again.So many features of our society will be transformed, from the way we are governed to where we work and how we entertain ourselves.The state will be far bigger and more powerful. Free enterprise will no longer flourish. Welfare dependency, even for businesses, will the new norm.Our social lives will reshape around the home, with travel firms, cinemas and restaurants feeling the burden, while key workers like our NHS heroes will replace narcissistic celebrities in our adoration.And in practice, we will live under a socialist system, where the government has effectively nationalised the entire economy.That dramatic change will be a legacy of the extraordinary measures adopted by the Treasury in the face of the coronavirus challenge.The Chancellor Rishi Sunak has recently announced a range of policies that amount to the biggest bailout in history, including a £ billion rescue package for businesses, a massive expansion in the social security system, and an unprecedented subsidy of up to  per cent for wages in the private sector.This vast intervention is on top of the Budget a fortnight ago, in which Mr Sunak announced the biggest increase in public expenditure since the s, as well as a colossal £ billion capital investment fund for infrastructure projects.Great Britain PLC has now been the subject of a takeover by the state.Mr Sunak’s phenomenal splurge is more radical than anything even Jeremy Corbyn proposed at the last election. And the clock will not be turned back.Having tasted economic control on an epic scale, Whitehall and Westminster will be reluctant to give it up.After all, the post-war socialist expansion of the state by the - Labour Government was not reversed for decades, despite long periods of Conservative rule, until Margaret Thatcher came to power in .Recent nationalisations like those of the railways and airlines will remain in place. The public sector will continue to dominate.But the new socialist Britain will be poorer and less dynamic.The services sector, which currently accounts for  per cent of the economy, will take decades to recover from the shutdown imposed by the coronavirus panic.With the collapse of so many businesses, especially in the hospitality trade and retailing, mass unemployment will cast a long shadow.At the same time, record levels of government debt will require huge levels of borrowing and higher taxation.The fall-out from the coronavirus crisis will probably also make our nation more inward-looking and less enthusiastic about globalisation.The barriers that are now going up around Europe will remain in place, while Britain is likely to impose stronger border controls.Immigration, currently running at over , new arrivals every year, is bound to plummet, especially when shrunken firms cannot claim to need cheap foreign labour.The international travel industry will continue to struggle once the crisis is over, with clients fearful of health risks.With reduced activity, it seems doubtful that the third runway at Heathrow Airport will ever be built.Ruined airlines and cruise companies will look back on pre-corona days as a golden age, though domestic tourism may receive a boost from the greater number of Brits holidaying at home.The Covid- catastrophe has exposed how fragile our inter-connected world really is.In an attempt to reduce our vulnerability, Britain is likely to become far more self-sufficient by strengthening our domestic supply lines, rebuilding our manufacturing base and bolstering the agricultural sector.Similarly, our dangerous dependence on Chinese contractors for everything from nuclear power to broadband technology will end.Future governments will be reluctant to reach the kind of deal that Boris Johnson recently did with the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to play a key role in the expansion of the G network.One key result of the Covid crackdown has been to show businesses that it is perfectly possible for a signicant number of their employees to work from home, thanks to the web.This trend is bound to gather pace even when the crisis has passed.The huge increase in home working will herald a long-term decline in the office, for so long one of the symbols of our sophisticated civilisation.And the consequences of such a change will be enormous.Commercial property, which is estimated to be worth around £ billion in Britain, will drastically fall in value.Commuting by road or rail will become far less common, leaving trains emptier and roads less congested.For the first time since rail privatisation, passenger numbers will drop signicantly.Nor will there be any justication for huge, expensive transport projects like the £ billion HS rail link or the vast proposed new £ billion Lower Thames crossing, linking Kent and Essex by road.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.In a culture dominated by home working, expensive city living will lose much of its appeal.Already overblown, property bubbles in fashionable hotspots like London and Manchester could soon burst.Yet, while the urban housing market runs into deep trouble, coastal and rural regions may well see a revival.Will Margate be the new Islington On a more profound level, the shock of the present crisis will leave us more oriented towards our homes and family le.We will be less obsessed with eating out, more focused on home entertainment. TV streaming services will grow rapidly. Cinema chains will shrink.Hardly any area of British le will be free of the covid revolution’s impact.Throughout the academic world, there will be more respect for valuable, practical subjects like science, engineering and medicine - and less for academic pursuits like media studies.In politics, there is likely to be less partisanship and more consensus, as highlighted by the remarkable praise heaped last week on Mr Sunak by the TUC for his bailout.In a shell-shocked country, trying to recover from economic meltdown and social lockdown, there won’t be much time for isive fads, poisonous identity politics or invented victimhood.Shrieking about safe spaces will sound like pathetic self-indulgence in a society where thousands are likely to have died from the Corona killer.What could be beneficial for Britain is a fundamental rethink about the values of our age.The health crisis has graphically revealed who really matters when it comes to the le-and-death crunch.As the death toll mounts, it is not the property speculators, lawyers, quango chiefs, and hedge fund managers that keep our country going, despite their vast financial rewards.It is the NHS staff, the care home workers, the retail assistants, the emergency services personnel, the lorry drivers and the shelf-stackers, many of whom have limited earnings.Perhaps in the new Britain forged by the coronavirus, we will lavish more on our carers, and less on our celebrities.Out of the current despair, we may come to recognise our real priorities.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Business groups and unions have urged the Chancellor to do more to help Britain’s freelancers, contractors, self-employed and creatives – who were offered just £ a week. Mr Sunak confirmed plans last week for at-risk employees to have up to % of their wages paid, up to a maximum of £, a month. He is now “actively considering” ways to plug the gaps in the support package amid claims he had “left behind” the self-employed. British Chamber of Commerce director general Dr Adam Marshall warned that thousands of sole traders need immediate help to survive as their livelihoods “vanish”. He said: “The government has taken massive steps to help businesses. Ministers must now ramp up support for the self-employed, many of whom have seen their livelihoods vanish in the blink of an eye. “There are five million people who need help similar in scale and scope to that put in place for larger firms.” Speaking today, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told MPs he will be making “further announcements” on help for the self-employed. But he refused to confirm reports that self-employed people will have % of their wages funded by government, like those in full-time or part-time work. Instead, he said there were “genuine practical” problems with bringing forward an “analogous” scheme to what fully-employed workers had received last week. Mr Sunak said: “There are genuine practical and principle reasons why it is incredibly complicated to design an analogous scheme to the one we have for employed workers.  “But he can rest assured that we absolutely understand the situation many self-employed people face at the moment as a result of what’s happening “And we are determined to find a way to support them. We just need to be confident that can be done in a way that is deliverable and fair to the vast majority of the British workforce.” Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: “There is a sense of urgency about this now. There isn’t any member of this House who hasn’t been contacted by a constituent in quite distressful state.” TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The government took a big and important step last week with support for employed workers. It’s only right that they quickly follow this with a similar level of support for the self-employed.” CBI director general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn added: “The £ is not enough for the self-employed to live on and I know the government, with business, are working to find a solution.” A Populus survey last week found almost half of the self-employed felt they would have to work eventhey had Covid-. It underlines the fears of unions and industry bodies who believe self-employed or gig economy workers would just carry on. Whitehall officials believe a universal basic income would be dficult to implement and that quicker solutions are needed. They are thought to be considering a Norway-style approach, where self-employed workers will get grants of % of their average income of the past three years.  Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has signalled that the Treasury is considering further measures. He told the BBC yesterday: “We appreciate this isn’t perfect and the Chancellor is going to keep reviewing the situation. It’s not as simple as supporting those in employment. “The purpose of our employment mechanism is to help continue the connection between employees and their business so, once this is over, those iniduals canto their usual work. It is operationally very dficult to create a scheme akin to that for the self-employed.” Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the self-employed were a “major omission” from the plans. Leadership favourite Keir Starmer, who has called for statutory sick pay to be tripled, said: “Ministers are several steps behind. Countries such as Denmark have shown what actions government can take to protect people’s incomes.” United Private Hire Drivers, which represents minicab drivers, said drivers “face the abyss” without help.  Pamela Morton, of the National Union of Journalists, said members are “seeing work dry up and face suffering real hardship”. More than , musicians have written to the Chancellor saying there had been “complete shutdown of our places of work”. The musicians, led by Ed Barker, a former saxophonist for George Michael, said: “We are simply asking for fair and equal treatment, and for the coronavirus Job Retention Scheme to be extended to the self-employed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus dr rosena allin khans","story":"NewsopinionCoronavirus: Dr Rosena Allin-Khans AE diary as staff fear they will be overwhelmedThe MP for Tooting has been working in her local hospital where doctors and nurses are already dealing with cases of covid-.

She regularly goes in to do shts in her local hospital St Georgeaposs and has been in contact with her colleagues. This Sunday she took a record down for Mirror readers about the situation faced by nurses, doctors and others on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus. She said her latest sht had been a deeply, deeply eye-opening experience with previously fit and healthy people in their s and s attached to machines, fighting for their lives. And she has been deeply critical of the approach taken by the government in tackling the spread of the deadly virus. The Prime Minister has been blase about this from the start, waiting for others to make decisions so he doesnapost have to. It is costing lives, she said. Mirror Diary - Sunday  March .am – Leaving the House On the way to work in AE, to help out the real heroes of the frontline – the NHS staff who work day-in, day-out to keep us all safe. I am a bit apprehensive after seeing the stories that are being reported about Covid- and having spoken to colleagues across the country, but we need to come together at times like these for our communities. am – Reporting for Duty Just finished handover, which is when the day sht gets given notes on the patients who have come in overnight. There’s a very real sense that the number of cases are growing extremely quickly, something that will present a real challenge in the coming days and weeks. Some of the sickest patients that have been admitted have been young – they’re in their s and s, previously fit and well, but now fighting for their lives in Intensive Care . There was a lot of talk in January that this was a virus just like the flu that only affects older people – that simply isn’t the case. There’s a real sense of apprehension ahead of the sht – we’re all expecting a rocky road ahead in the coming days. am- Protective Equipment The first part of the sht was spent looking for Personal Protective Equipment– these are masks and aprons that keep those working on the frontlines safe. While we’d all rather be treating patients, we have to ensure that we are adequately protected so we don’t spread the infection between patients. Frontline staff across the country are scared. We’re scared that we’re going to lose patients – we have spent years training to save every le that we can. We are scared of passing this deadly virus onto our loved ones because we don’t always have the PPE that we so desperately need. We’re scared that thatwe aren’t properly protected, that we run the risk of spreading the virus between patients. It’s vital that people practice social distancing measures properly – crowded areas will only add to the number of cases, and the number of people being admitted into hospitals across the country. In the coming days and weeks, dficult decisions will be made by my colleagues in ICU about who gets a ventilator – it’s that serious.  Midday – Resus overwhelmed The whole of resus is full of patients with respiratory problems – this is the part of AE where the sickest patients go. Patients are arriving breathless, with crackles so fine in their lungs, you can hardly hear them. Their X-rays show white lungs where normally, they would look clear and black, full of air. Major trauma, such as heart attacks and victims of car crashes, are now being moved into paediatric AE. The situation around Covid- is clearly getting worse by the day. The talk amongst the team is that we feel that we will be overwhelmed in the coming days. I’m going for a refresher course on ventilators for staff – they’re also training new staff on how to use ventilators. The talk is, of course, feeling quite bleak as the day goes on – but this is what we’ve all been trained for.

Mr Sunak promised to fund up to % of peopleaposs wages and offer £bn of support to business. But critics said his announcement did not do enough for the self-employed, who cannot claim the wage guarantee or Statutory Sick Pay.Instead they were left to rely on Universal Credit, which was raised by £, a year and had an income floor removed making it easier for the self-employed to claim.  That was seen as not enough after the government ordered households not to mix and for a vast range of shops to shut.

People are only allowed to leave the house for four reasons - shopping for basic necessities, one form of exercise a day, any medical or caring need, and travelling to and from work where this is absolutely necessary. Police will be given the powers to fine those who disobey. Yet itaposs that fourth reason - going to work - that has left millions of Brits mired in confusion this morning. Thataposs because the government has left it very unclear for whom, exactly, it is absolutely necessary to go to work. Unless youaposre a key workeror work for an industry thataposs been forcibly shut downthereaposs a huge grey area over whether you can stay away. That means bosses have still been asking workers to turn up across the country. And despite mounting fears over the spread of the virus, some of these bosses will be completely within their rights. The guidance is hazy in places, but as a public service we have pulled together the best guide we possibly can to who can, should, and shouldnapost go to work. The basic rules Everyone must stay at home wherever they can  No matter what your job, you must do it from at homeat all possible. You can only leave the house for four reasons:Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible One form of exercise a day - for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from homeIf you can work from home, work from home As a general rule, the government has said anyone who can work from home must work from home. You should only travel into work in personit is an absolutely necessary part of your job. If your business has been shut down, thereaposs a good chance you donapost need to go to work anyway  A whole litany of businesseshave been shut down - see the full list below. If your job is on this list, you probably wonapost need to go in, unless itaposs to provide takeaway services or help close up shop. Your firm can claim % of your wages back from the government, but that wonapost stop the possibility of you being laid off or having to take a pay cut. BUT millions of people do still need to go to work - and itaposs not just aposkey workersapos  There are millions of aposkey workersapos including NHS staff, police and firefighters who should continue going to work . See the full list below. However, there is a grey area for jobs that arenapost aposkey workersapos, but havenapost been forcibly shut down either. Unlike some countries, the government has not said that anyone who isnapost a key worker must stay away from work. If youaposre:Not a key worker But your firm hasnapost been shut down And you canapost work from home,... the government has not prevented your bosses being able to call you into work today. Instead, the guidance is that your firm can ask you to come to work - but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home. The exact rules are being left to inidual firms.If you do go to work, you should apossocially distanceapos once you get there Anyone who is going into work is being told to keep  metres between them and other people where possible, and to cut down or completely eliminate face-to-face meetings. For retail workers this means:Ensure a distance of m between customers and shop assistants Let people enter the shop only in small groups Queue control is required outside of shops and other essential premises that remain openThere are still unresolved problems for the self-employedThe government was this morning racing to work out some kind of system for the self-employed. As of Tuesday at am they could not claim Statutory Sick Pay or a wage guarantee and must claim Universal Credit. Itaposs thought that will be changed very shortly to encourage self-employed people not to go to work. If you are self-employed and do go to work, the government advises you follow the advice on social distancing above. So for builders this means going to large new-build sites but not doing domestic jobs in peopleaposs homes.  No matter what,you have a cough or fever you must stay at home If you have a new, continuous cough or a fever your entire household must self-isolate at home for  days since the onset of symptoms. This means not leaving the house at all. Andyouaposre one of .million people contacted by the NHS you must stay at home .million people have been contacted by the NHS directlythey are particularly vulnerable to severe coronavirus. There people must stay at home for  weeks, regardless of whether they would normally be expected to work.

His devastated family had hoped to give the popular teenager a fitting send-off but must now instead hold a scaled down burial with no church service and only ten people at the graveside. Other mourners must wait inside their cars. His father Chris, , says: “Nicholas was such a happy, popular lad and there will be hundreds of people who would like to attend his funeral. “Now, because of the virus, that won’t be possible. “Losing a child is every parent’s worst nightmare. To be told we cannot even say goodbye in the traditional way is heart-breaking. I feel like it’s the last thing we could do for our son and it’s been taken away. “It feels like agony after agony. But we know this is the only way.” Nick’s mother, Kim Clarke, , discovered her son foaming at the mouth after eating a takeaway kebab on March .  Nick turned blue and screamed ‘I can’t breathe’, just minutes after taking a bite of a kebab he had ordered from his local takeaway in Liverpool. Kim and her fiancé, Chris are going through hell following the death of their son, who was in hospital for four nights on a ventilator before his death on March . Chris says: “Nick came home after visiting his girlfriend, he had picked up a takeaway from his usual place. “It all happened so fast, he was saying he couldn’t breathe, panicking. Our eldest son gave him CPR.”  Nick was the second eldest of the couple’s four children and was a lively, happy boy who loved football and adored his girlfriend, Paisley, . His parents discovered he had a nut allergy at the age of two when they gave him a peanut butter sandwich and he had a severe allergic reaction. They rushed him to hospital and his condition was carefully controlled all throughout his childhood. In his teens, he always used the same takeaway where staff knew of his allergies.  Chris says: “Nick was always really careful. He checked everything before he ate it. He never had a bad reaction at all – until this. He had never had to use an epi-pen. It was so well managed. “He was getting ready to do his GCSEs and go to college to do an apprenticeship in engineering. “We can’t believe he’s gone.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus how make flat bread","story":"NewsCoronavirus: How to make flat bread with simple ingredientsyour shop has run outWith many supermarkets running out of basic food supplies during the coronavirus pandemic, a chef has shared a recipe to make flat bread at home, using just five simple ingredients and it can all be done in a panShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  MAR NewsYou can make the bread in a pan on the hob \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Costs pennies and can get you through these strange times, my family lived off these when the pickings were slim. Youaposll need two cups of flour, one cup of lukewarm water , one tablespoon of baking powder, one teaspoon of kosher salt, and one table spoon of oil or butter. Brandon instructed to combine the dry ingredients together before adding most of the water and mixing until it has the consistency of tacky pizza dough. You can add more waterrequired. Knead it for a few minutes before leaving it to rest in a greased bowl for half an hour to an hour.  After that, ide it into six pieces and roll out the mixture on a floured surface until it is quite thin - the same thickness as a tortilla. Heat a griddle and cook the dough until golden brown spots appear and flip until it is cooked on both sides.

The poignant images captures the heartbreaking reality grieving families are having to face amid the Covid- outbreak. The five chairs were placed two metres apart ahead of a service at an unidentied crematorium on Monday.The heartbreaking scene captured how the stricter coronavirus distancing rules have been introduced for funerals as Britain goes into lockdown.It comes as venues across the nation introduce tougher rules for funerals, with some limiting the number of mourners to five or just immediate family. Boris Johnson announced funerals will still be allowed to go ahead, despite banning other social events such as weddings and christenings.Those grieving deaths have already been advised to avoid hugging, kissing or shaking hands when consoling loved ones as well as not handling orders of service. Now local authorities are stepping up measures to reduce capacity at crematoriums in light of the Prime Ministeraposs announcement on Monday night. One clergyman, who wished to remain anonymous, said: It breaks your heart to see scenes like this when conducting a service. Funerals should be a celebration of someoneaposs le, with friends and family surrounding each other for support and being able to hug each other. To see them reduced to such tiny numbers of people is a sad reminder of the crisis we are facing as a nation at the moment.  One funeral director in Worcester has revealed some funerals are going ahead without anybody in attendance to say their final farewells due to the coronavirus fears. Mark Campion, director of Jackson Family Funeral Directors, said many cremations were now being carried out without a funeral service beforehand to be safer. He also said a vicar held out a broomstick at a recent service to keep people apart and other upcoming funerals due to have hundreds in the congregation will now only be attended by three close family members. He added: Things have dramatically changed for us. I have not seen anything like this in  years. I just feel so sorry for the families because they canapost say goodbye to their loved ones like they usually would. Itaposs extremely sad for the families.Guidelines, published by the Funeral Celebrancy Council and issued by Humanists UK, advise families only have essential attendees who must obey social distancing rules. Isabel Russo, head of ceremonies at Humanists UK, said: Our main priority is ensuring that we support bereaved families to say farewell to their loved one in a personal and meaningful way, while still following the guidelines to keep people safe. We are also urging the Government to issue specic advice for the funeral industry to bring clarity across the sector. The Funeral Celebrant Councilaposs Independent celebrant rep, Emma Curtis said: Over the last week funeral celebrants around the country have felt a great deal of anxiety. The Funeral Celebrancy Council has responded swtly to issue clear guidelines to funeral celebrants as a coherent approach to help protect, not only the health and welfare of the bereaved people we serve, but also our fellow professionals, and wider society.  York Crematorium now only allows five mourners at a time and offers video streams of funeral services in a bid to stop the spread of the virus. Elsewhere, The London Cremation Company, has followed suit and is only permitting  mourners at a time. Dudley Council has written to funeral directors saying only next of kin, siblings and partners, parents, children and partners, and a carerapplicable, will be allowed to attend cremations .

Becky Rule, from Wales, can’t remember the joyous reunion after she almost died from a serious brain infection which she developed while pregnant. The -year-old from Wrexham was given a % chance of survival but is now on the road to recovery despite suffering memory loss and having to learn to read and write again.Becky arrived at hospital with a severe migraine and confused speech the day before her baby was due, the Daily Post reports.Both mum and baby were found to have an extremely high heart rate, leaving doctors at Wrexham Maelor Hospital with little option but to carry out an emergency cesarean. Baby Jackson was born a healthy lb oz and was moved to the hospital’s Special Care Baby Unit for observation for the next seven days. Meanwhile, Becky was left fighting for her le after suffering multiple seizures and was whisked to the Walton Centre in Liverpool where she spent the next two weeks in a medically-induced coma. A lumber puncture revealed she had meningoencephalitis, also known as encephalomeningitis – an inflammation of the brain and its surrounding protective membranes. Resembling both meningitis and encephalitis, it can be caused by bacteria and viruses.Becky’s partner, Dan Harries, , had to take on the full care of the couple’s baby while his partner battled for le. Becky, a women’s wear manager at Debenhams in Eagles Meadow shopping centre in Wrexham said: “I was given a % chance of survival. “My family were told that evenI did make it through, it was likely I would have no memory or be able to walk or talk.  “They didn’t know where in my brain the infection had hit and they couldn’t be % sure of the outcome. “I still don’t know how I got it.”  She added: “I had a perfect pregnancy and worked right up until I was  weeks.  “I didn’t have any morning sickness, I was fine.” Doctors gave Becky steroid injections to reduce the swelling on her brain as a last resort before operating.  The treatment worked and Becky was brought out of her coma two weeks after giving birth. She finally met Jackson in an emotional reunion in hospital, which was captured on video, but Becky cannot remember anything of the experience.  It would signal the start of a very long journey to recovery. The illness has left her with short-term memory loss, loss of taste and the inability to feel full or hungry. It has even forced her to learn to read and write all over again. Becky spent five weeks in hospital and believes her decision to get checked out quickly probably saved the le of her baby son.  “I thank God I went in as fast as I did. I was so lucky I had an emergency C-section and nothing was transferred to Jackson,” she said. “Jackson was my absolute priority. I just wanted to be home and be a family. “But I still couldn’t talk. Even when I came home I could only say odd words. It was weird.  “I struggled to hold his milk bottle. At first, I’d have to set alarms on my phone to remind me of milk feeds. “Essentially, they’ve said I needed to start again. “I need to teach myself asI were a child again. I’m nowhere near %.  “I spent a lot of time practising but it’s dficult when you have a young baby.”  Becky credited her partner Dan for keeping everything together and encouraging her progress. “Dan was amazing. As soon as Jackson was out of hospital he brought him to see me,” she said. Dan, who also works at Debenhams said: “There was no feeling, it was just shock.  “The doctor came in to us and said it was an infection on the brain and to prepare for the worst,” he said. “But we convinced ourselves she’d be ok. Some people are so unlucky. With what happened it could’ve been much worse. You just have to get on with it.” Becky is now hoping to help other survivors in their journey back to full health by taking part in Liverpool’s Colour Obstacle Rush in June to raise money for the Encephalitis Society, which provides advice and support to people who have been affected by the condition. “They have been absolutely amazing,” said Becky. “The society is run by doctors and people who can give real medical advice. They are people who want to help rather than focus on the negatives.

Apprentice manual worker Keelan Nugent, , was driving like a aposlunaticapos in his tiny VW Polo, a court heard. He had offered to give his friends a lt a home but squeezed so many people into his car, one woman agreed to get into the boot. Despite being warned to drive slowly, Nugent put his foot down, jumped two sets of red traffic lights and ignored all requests to stop. His car careered off the road when it clipped a traffic island as he attempted to drive round it the wrong way. Estate agent Tyler Wilson, , who was in the boot of the car was flung from the vehicle as he spun into bushes and trees and sustained severe injuries including a fracture to the spine. The mother of one is expected to develop a stoop in later le due to her wounds and is said to be suicidal. Three other people in the car were also taken to hospital for ious injuries. Tests revealed Nugent, from Heywood, Greater Manchester was almost one and a half times the alcohol limit and has also been snorting cocaine. In a statement Miss Wilson said: Since my involvement in the collision my le has been a constant struggle. My injuries are not healing properly and Iaposm likely to be in pain for the rest of my le and it is likely I will develop a stoop. I have been off work for -weeks causing me to fall into rent arrears in the home I share with my five-year-old son leaving me feeling suicidal.  Keelan has shown very little or no remorse towards me he had been trying to make it out to be all my fault for getting into the boot. I know it was foolish but had I had any knowledge he was drunk or taking drugs I wouldnapost have got in. He was fully aware I was in the boot I would expect him to be more careful. I have felt trapped both financially and emotionally since the incident. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Nugent, admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving, drink driving and drug driving. he was also banned from driving for six years. The incident occurred on July  last year after the youngsters met during a night out in Rochdale. Brian Berlyne prosecuting: Tyler, her sister Jenna and Jennaaposs fiance went to bars and clubs and then decided in the early hours that they should head home. During the course of the evening Jennaaposs fiance had met Mr Nugent and he offered a lt home to a number of people including their party. There was insufficient room for all of them in his car unless one of them travelled in the boot so it was decided that Tyler would get in the boot. She agreed only after she was assured by Mr Nugent he would drive carefully but she was unaware he had consumed a signicant amount of alcohol and had been taking drugs. Mr Berlyne said Miss Wilson noticed Nugent starting to speed up when he began driving. Her sister noticed that Nugent was driving at more than mph, the court heard. He drove through two sets of traffic lights and she shouted at him to slow down and Tyler shouted aposstop itapos from the boot, Mr Berlyne said. Jennaaposs fiance describes him as driving extremely fast and that requests to slow down were ignored. He slowed as he approached a speed camera but then accelerated as he passed it. Passengers estimated he was driving at  miles per hour as they approached a traffic island. He attempted to pass the island on the wrong side of the road and then clipped the island. The vehicle left the road, spinning into bushes and trees. The court heard Miss Wilsonaposs sister got out to check on her after the crash. She found her lying in the bushes nearby with a damaged lung and fractures to her collar bone, shoulder blade, ribs and spine. The mum, who also suffered injuries to her head, face and hands, stayed in hospital for two weeks. Mr Berlyne said: Police who attended saw Nugentaposs vehicle on its side within the bush. Nugent approached the officer told him he had been driving the vehicle and was asked to provide a breath sample which was positive and he was arrested and taken to hospital. In interview he confirmed he had consumed alcohol and cocaine, he admitted his driving was dangerous but denied he knew anyone was in the boot of the car.  There is evidence of grossly excessive speed and he drove through two sets of red traffic lights. Tests showed Nugent had  milligrams of alcohol per  millilitres of blood. The legal alcohol limit in blood is ml. He also had  micrograms of Benzoylecgonine, a bi-product of cocaine in his system - the limit being mg. In a statement to the court Nugent said: I would like to apologise for putting myself before the court and I would like to express my deepest regret and remorse for my behaviour. I would like to apologise to the persons involved and injured in the incident. I have let myself, my family and my friends down as well as my girlfriend. It was my actions that day that resulted in people being injured I can only blame myself for the injuries. There are no excuses for what happened, and I take full responsibility for my actions - I can only promise it wonapost happen again. I am horried by what I have done this is my first and only driving offence. I deeply regret it and Iaposm embarrassed for my family and myself. In mitigation, defence lawyer David Bruce said: This is a very sad case he is now  years of age since leaving school he has been working very hard and successfully completed an apprenticeship which involved him going to college.

A mysterious good Samaritan has been leaving gts for brave NHS workers in hospital car parks. Two teenagers heartbroken after seeing an old man left with nothing in his shopping basket are now delivering care packages to the elderly in self-isolation. Ponies have been wandering up to windows to spread smiles to people isolating themselves indoors. Free parking is being offered to NHS workers at many car parks to say thank you for their hard work.

Have you or a family member been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror A kind-hearted stranger - know only as aposJamesapos - has left several shoe boxes containing items such as toilet roll, moisturiser, vouchers and alcohol to NHS staff. The thoughtful presents have appeared in the car park of John Radclfe Hospital and at Didcot Ambulance Station in Oxford, Oxon in recent days. An attached note reads: Dear NHS worker, just a little thank you. Hopefully you find some of it useful when all of this is over. Get yourself a treat. James x.One worker posted her find on a local Facebook group in the hope of finding the anonymous samaritan.She said: Iaposm not surethis will get to the right person but everyone at the John Radclfe Hospital would like to say thank you the lovely man that was putting surprise shoe boxes on cars in the carpark! Thank you, you bought tears to our eyes. In another kind act, best pals Sam Hornsby and Matty Perry were left feeling upset when they saw an old man who looked desolate as he struggled to get supplies due to coronavirus shortages.But the -year-olds wanted to deliver smiles around their community and immediately devised a plan to help others who were self-isolating due to Covid-. They pooled together roughly £ each of their own money and bought items like pasta, porridge, biscuits, toilet roll and teabags and filled  bags to be delivered. They went door-to-door around the village of Harlington, South Yorks., where they live, and now plan to continue for as long as they can.  Sam, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, said: We saw him looking so sad and he was left with nothing, he was just looking at a single bag of flour he had in his hand. All I was thinking was that I would never want to see my grandparents left to feel like that - it was so heartbreaking. As we walked out of ASDA we said letaposs chip our money in together and see what we can do to help our little village. It blew up from there and now weaposre hoping to continue to help as many people as we can.  He added: We want to inspire others to take care of the elderly in the way they took care of us. Ponies have been wandering up to windows to spread smiles as Britain enters full coronavirus lockdown. The equines made house calls after accepting requests to be brought up to peopleaposs homes. They stand close to windows to keep visits contact-free and to give space to self-isolating residents. The animals are from Park Lane Stables in Teddington, Surrey.  Earlier this week, the riding centre said: Out and about with Park Lane Stables RDA in Teddington Town as they took to the streets of Teddington to spread some smiles to isolated due to Covid Coronavirus. The Little Ripon Bookshop in North Yorkshire, has become an important leline for lonely elderly residents who have been forced into quarantine. Owners Gill and Simon Edwards have been adapting to the new lockdown measures by delivering books from their store to wherever people need them. Phoebe Edwards, , works in her parents shop and said they “owe” it to their customers to keep trying to get books to them however they can. She said: “We’re still healthy and for now can keep going around town, so long as we are sensible. “Delivering books to customers who can’t get out is something we’ve done before, because we have customers who are sometimes too ill to leave the house, or it would be much easier for themthey didn’t have to, so we try and do what we can. Phoebe said they didn’t want their customers to be “stuck with nothing to do”. “Books are one of the best sources of entertainment and escapism”, she said. “It wouldn’t do to be without.” "},{"url":null,"title":"what coronavirus lockdown means post","story":"NewsWhat coronavirus lockdown means for post - Royal Mail explains contingency plansRoyal Mail is \"open for business\" amid the coronavirus Covis- pandemic and bosses have released a statement addressing customers concerns about delays or closureShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video coronavirus-full-list-jobs-classed-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news what-coronavirus-lockdown-means-post-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

We’re all in the same situation.“I’ve been nipping to my mum’s and using the gym to keep me occupied but I know I can’t keep doing that.“It’s the best job in the world being a footballer and when you’re not able to do it, it’s rubbish.“However, you have to realise there is a bigger picture. It’s easy to look from a selfish point of view and moan but there is a bigger issue of people’s safety and their health.”He added: “I get cabin fever at the best of times, never mind with this situation.“Anyone who knows me has been saying ‘you’ll go off your head in the house’, I always need to be doing stuff. I’ve been pottering around the house but I struggle to sit around.“I’m already missing going into Dens and seeing everyone, there’s always plenty of banter. I’d usually get a bit off Gowser so it’ll good to get a rest from him!“You think about these things but at the back of the mind you are always aware there are more important things than football, it’s about keeping things in perspective.“That might be good for me in the long-term, I would always have a bad game in my head and people would say ‘there are more important things than football’ and I can definitely see that now.”Training has been cancelled all week at Dens Park and, with no indication from the authorities of when it will be safe to restart playing, Kerr and his team-mates have had to find ways to fill their time away from the football pitch.For a young man like Kerr who is dedicated to his job and keeping himself in the best shape possible for his boyhood club, that’s not been easy and he knows it will get harder over the coming weeks as everyone gets to grips to such a massive change to normal le.The -year-old added: “My usual routine is to head to Dens early doors about am, recently I’ve been doing a bit with the physio Gerry Docherty after the problem with my knee, and start training at am till lunchtime.“Then it’s gym in the afternoon and home before maybe heading to the pool or sauna in the evening. Changing that for me has been dficult.“Since we’ve been off I’ve been getting a longer lie and going to meet up with some people.“Fin Robertson is one of the local boys so we’ve gone for coffee.“It’s the same struggles that everyone is having – going to the shops and not being able to get handwash and stuff like that.“It’s dficult to do anything really because there is nothing concrete to say when we are going to restart.”When the Dark Blues do finally get back out on the pitch, Kerr expects the good form since the start of February to continue as Dundee look to put their up-and-down start to le in the Championship behind them.“I had said from day one we had a really good group of players at the club and I don’t think it was expected we would be so inconsistent,” he added.“The boys who came in in January have all brought something and we had been doing well up until the shutdown.“We have a standard to meet every day and,we were still playing, we would expect to be getting better and better.”PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – What the coronavirus could mean for Dundee and Dundee United\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp podcast-twa-teams-one-street-what-the-coronavirus-could-mean-for-dundee-and-dundee-united embed # secreteTtVElWoIb\" data-secret\"eTtVElWoIb\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b029991d13a2-692x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fc dundee united simon murray transfer","story":"Former Dundee and Dundee United striker Simon Murray is targeting ato the Scottish game this summer after playing his last game in South Africa.Murray, , hopes an extension to this season due to the coronavirus shutdown might even see him back in action on home soil before the end of the campaign.The Dundonian has enjoyed the last  months on an adventure at Bidwest Wits in the South African top flight but has had to spend almost the entirety of this season on the sidelines.A damaged cruciate ligament early in the campaign required surgery which saw his place in the squad taken up.Speaking from Johannesburg, he told the Tele: “I hurt my knee in the third game of the season and needed an operation so I’ve been out six-and-a-half months.“Because there’s a limit on the number of foreign players over here, the club signed another forward when I was injured and took my place so we’ve come to an agreement to terminate my contract when I’m fit.“The club have been really good, to be honest, they’ve made sure I got through the injury and looked after me during rehab.“The plan was to stay here in South Africa, get the rehab done and recover from the injury and then head back to Scotland in the summer but because of all this coronavirus it is up in the air.”Murray revealed there has already been interest in his services, once he is back up and running, from Premiership and Championship clubs.He said: “During the injury, I’ve had some interest from a few teams. Nothing concrete, though, and I want to prove my fitness first before doing anything.“If the season gets extended, that might end up being a good thing for me.“There might even be time for me to play for somebody this season depending on what happens. That would be great for my fitness before heading into pre-season.”Despite the impact the coronavirus has had on le back in Scotland, Murray and his family are planning to head back to Dundee in the coming weeks with his time at Wits coming to an end.In South Africa, the virus hasn’t yet had the same effect as in Europe and the football season was only shut down last week.He admits there are worries but being back home and closer to family and friends is a draw for Murray as he plots the next move of a career that has seen him turn out for Montrose, Downfield, Tayport, Dundee Violet, Arbroath, United, Hibs and then the Dark Blues before heading for Johannesburg.CALUM WOODGER: It#s a perfect storm and, make no doubts about it, Dundee and Dundee United are right in the eye of it\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-dundee-fc-dundee-united-spfl-shutdown embed # secretlKqPsPpAv\" data-secret\"lKqPsPpAv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"He added: “There haven’t been any deaths so it is all just starting here, to be honest.“I think countries like this have learned from the ones who got it first so President Cyril Ramaphosa here is putting measures in place for prevention, hand sanitiser everywhere and things like that.“I get UK TV so I’ve been hearing all the stuff from home, get to see Boris every night, and it is worrying.“Having lived in South Africa, you are isolated at the best of times anyway so that won’t be as much a problem for people here.“You never walk anywhere for safety reasons – don’t get me wrong, it’s a great place but you have to be careful.”Murray has loved his time in South Africa but says he’s looking forward to getting back home.“I’ve missed Scottish football in some ways, not others I suppose,” he added.“The football is good over here but there’s not the passion in the stands like in Scotland.“It’s a dferent culture.

But, at the same time, I also completely disagree.While our minds are being blown with stress and mild panic about being shut in our homes and where we’re going to locate our next roll of toilet paper, we all desperately need a release to think about something .Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney + and the rest will be doing a roaring trade right now as people figure out what to fill spare time with.It’s exactly the same for football debate – there’s no games but that doesn’t stop the debate, thankfully.Doesn’t make le easy for a football writer, mind you . . .Nor is it easy for the likes of Ian Maxwell and Neil Doncaster as they attempt to navigate the minefield that is now our game.The big clubs haven’t wasted any time in applying pressure for what they want to see – Celtic want to be awarded the title, Rangers obviously disagree and Hearts don’t want to be relegated.I have to say, apart from the Hearts viewpoint, it’s all pretty nauseating.What the heid honchos have on their plate right now is probably the biggest decision ever in the history of Scottish football.The Rangers Sevco debate pales in comparison and it’s not like we’ve ever heard the end of that one in Glasgow.Definitely rather them than me. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, whatever decision they come to, it’s going to hurt somebody.And I think they were right to give themselves some breathing space with Monday’s statement.Personally, I’d have picked a date in the middle of April and said we’ll see what’s what at that point with some plans thought up in the meantime.Initially, I was in favour of restarting the season in the autumn and then running straight into the new one, maybe scrap the League Cup. The transfer window and players’ contracts ending in May June just makes that a can of worms.Now, though, I’ll echo my colleague Lee Wilkie’s thoughts yesterday – expand the structure and keep as many clubs happy as possible.As in so many situations in le – do what big Wilkie says . . .It was only right Uefa postpone the European Championship until next summer – there was no other call to make.The championships would have put a completely unreasonable time limit on getting club football – whenever it gets going again – finished in time.However, the decision to knock the qualying play-offs back to June seems very short-sighted.I would be delightedany football is played before June, to be honest.I really think we’re in for a long, long haul of society shutting down to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.And Uefa should be aware they will likely just have to kick the can on the play-offs down the road again in three months’ time.They are such massive games for countries like us and I’m sure Scotland boss Steve Clarkewill want his players to have been in action for a few weeks going into the Israel game.Very little of this situation is fair but I can’t help but think Uefa have been a bit quick to make these decisions.Dundee and Dundee United have more to lose from this season being cancelled than almost anybody.Hearts would be the exception and possibly Partick.However, missing out on a place in the Premiership, particularly for United when it was nailed on, would be massively unfair. The Dark Blues can make an argument themselves about the play-offs, too.The work, and pots of cash, already put in this season has to count for something.THE world might be going down the drain but I have to try to see a silver lining. With the season stopped and, possibly declared null and void, my team Queen of the South can’t be relegated, so there’s that . . ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"poll do you agree with government lockdown imposed due to coronavirus pandemic","story":"Tough new measures to fight coronavirus will see a ban on people gathering in public and restrict people leaving their homes.Nicola Sturgeon said it amounted to a #lockdown# # but the actions were necessary to slow the spread of Covid-, ease pressure on the NHS and ultimately save lives.Speaking at St Andrew#s House in Edinburgh, she said people #should stay at home#.From the Editor: The Tele is on your side — that’s why we’re offering our ePaper FREE for three months\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp from-the-editor-the-tele-is-on-your-side-thats-why-were-offering-our-epaper-free-for-three-months embed # secretjZnXZioGt\" data-secret\"jZnXZioGt\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"It came on the day the death toll from the virus rose to  in the UK.The first minister was speaking after Boris Johnson announced stringent measures for at least three weeks which will see the closure of non-essential shops, libraries, playgrounds, outdoor gyms, and places of worship.From now on, people must stay at home except for:Scotland#s most senior police officer, Chief Inspector Iain Livingstone has said officers north of the border #won#t hesitate# to use their new powers to enforce the ban. We want to know your thoughts on the ban, endorsed by both Holyrood and Westminster at this dficult time.Dundee Job Centre workers #dealing with  applicants each# as coronavirus takes its toll\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-job-centre-workers-dealing-with--applicants-each-as-coronavirus-takes-its-toll embed # secrettACZtzqSOL\" data-secret\"tACZtzqSOL\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Please vote in our quick poll below."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-gorbals-vampire-stalked-city-streets","story":"IT HAS gone down in history as one of the most spine-chilling moments in Glasgowrsquos ghoulish past."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-nicola-sturgeon-says-parks-not-full-says-dont-gather-weddings-celebrations","story":"The First Minister has hit out at those flocking to parks and beaches as she announcedthe government advice on preventing the spread of coronavirus is \"not optional\"."},{"url":null,"title":"janice-bell-pans-people-pussycat-dolls","story":"LAST weekend eight of us descended on Arran for a girlsrsquo weekend.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with supernatural beings using a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"holyrood-business-curtailed-scotland-tackles-pandemic","story":"Business at Scottish Parliament is to be cut back following advice to stay indoors amid the coronavirus outbreak.Subject to parliamentary approval, business in the Holyrood chamber will not take place as usual on Wednesday and Thursday this week.First Ministerrsquos Questions typically takes place at noon on Thursday.Nicola Sturgeon is due to make at statement in Holyrood on the Covid- pandemic on Tuesday, followed by a debate on a legislative consent motion for the UK Governmentrsquos emergency powers bill to deal with coronavirus.The next date the Scottish Parliament is due to meet is Wednesday April .The Scottish Parliament said in a statement: ldquoFollowing yesterdayrsquos announcement by the First Minister, the Parliamentary Bureau has met to confirm the chamber business for this week.ldquoSubject to Parliamentrsquos agreement, the Parliament will meet today and next Wednesday April   only.ldquoThere is no chamber business scheduled for Wednesday March  or Thursday March ..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Holyrood business to be curtailed as Scotland tackles pandemic"},{"url":null,"title":"banks-reduce-hours-impose-social-distancing-measures-combat-coronavirus","story":"Major banks and building societies are temporarily reducing their opening hours and or shutting branches as coronavirus spreads.Social distancing measures are also being imposed in branches to help limit the spread of Covid- ndash which may result in longer queues outside.Some providers are encouraging customers to only visit a branchit is absolutely necessary, with digital and telephone banking services also available.Here is a round-up of what has been said:ndash Nationwide Building SocietyAs an essential service wersquore doing all we can to keep our branches open.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

Shersquos right, of course. We need such stories just now.My response was: ldquoYes, we all need to make our own version of Stone Soup.My youngest daughter overheard me. ldquoYuck, I donrsquot want that, I want porridge for breakfast like usual, she said.I reassured her and reminded her of the story. Itrsquos an old tale Irsquove shared in these pages before. It has many versions and I base the story in a land when there is a famine and people have very little food on which to survive, and so understandably people keep what little they have for their own use.But then a wise traveller fills his pot with water and begins to boil it over a fire. Then he adds a stone. People get curious and ask: ldquoWhat are you making  The traveller replies: ldquoStone soup.ldquoStone soup  Never heard of that.ldquoOh, itrsquos delicious and very filling.ldquoCould I try some ldquoOf course, but it would taste betteryou had something to add to it, says the traveller.And so as the story unfolds, each person adds a little to the pot, which means in the end the soup really is delicious and filling, and there is enough for all, because everyone has shared the little they have.But before they eat, the traveller does one last thing ndash takes out the stone!My daughter remembered the story and was reassured stone soup wasnrsquot on the breakfast menu. But I think the storyrsquos meaning has deeper signicance than just the sharing of food. Itrsquos also about the sharing of ourselves, and how adding a little bit of who we are can transform the pot of community.In the midst of all the fear and panic around us just now, this is what is happening. People are helping out, checking on neighbours and thinking how their own behaviour can affect others who are more vulnerable.And in all this, our mental wellbeing is as important as our physical health. Irsquom reminded of something my motherrsquos partner once told me. His name was Harry. He was originally from Holland and in his childhood he lived through the horric Dutch famine of -.He said: ldquoWe survived on rotten potato soup, tulip bulbs and a joke a day. Sometimes the jokes were as rotten as the potatoes but just as important!We need to smile, laugh and feel connected, especially in dficult times. We can all begin our own metaphorical stone soup and invite others to contribute and share.For example, many of my fellow storytellers are arranging online storytelling sessions. I will be telling stories online for the schools I currently work with and Irsquom happy to do likewise for any other organisation or group ndash once my six-year-old has taught me how the technology works!There are local musicians playing online gigs, people sharing recipes, visiting older family members outside their windows, writing letters and telephoning people for a chat the list goes on. One idea can lead to another, and soon a new community pot is made!Every contribution, no matter how seemingly small, can make a big dference to that pot. And in so doing, it will challenge that sense of despair and powerlessness that so many of us feel right now.So the question should be: Whatrsquos your thing  How can you safely share it  Whatrsquos your amusing or uplting story or your talent  Think about it and letrsquos share, for others, as well as ourselves.And so in the spirit of this, here is my wee contribution for this week itrsquos a funny wee tale passed onto me, so I claim no credit or originality for it. It was told to me by an Irish friend, but Irsquove adapted it slightly.There was this van driver called George who got a job delivering monkeys to the zoo. Unfortunately, his van broke down and while waiting for the mechanic the monkeys began to get restless.Then another van driver called Archie pulled up and askedhe could help.ldquoIrsquom late for my delivery. If I give you pound, will you take these monkeys to the zoo  asked George.ldquoSure, said Archie.So Archie took the monkeys away in his van.George waited for the mechanic and finally his van was repaired. He then set off for the zoo to make sure the monkeys were delivered successfully.But to his surprise, he saw Archie walking along the street with the monkeys!George called out to him: ldquoWhat are you doing  I gave you pound to take the monkeys to the zoo!Archie called back: ldquoI did, but we got a group discount, I have some money left, so now Irsquom taking them to the cinema!"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-residents-urged-keep-helping-east-lothian-foodbank","story":"The foodbank, based in Tranent, provides food parcels to vulnerable members of the community.Candace Higgins, foodbank director, said the situation was changing ldquohour by hour, adding: ldquoWe are still operating as normal but certain protocols have been put in place when delivering food parcels.Volunteers making deliveries are now simply knocking on doors or ringing bells, rather than waiting for doors to be opened to them.

This includes people over , as well as people with underlying conditions that could make the symptoms of coronavirus worse.Unfortunately for these people, self-isolation means not leaving your house - making going walks outside or meeting friends an impossibility. But the government does say people who are self-isolating can keep windows open to get fresh air.Whatrsquos social distancing The government is advising everyone who is not currently self-isolating to still practise social distancing.This means not meeting with friends and family, staying away from crowded areas, avoiding all non-essential travel, and working from home where possible.Luckily for these people, there is no restriction on going for walks outside. The government website actually encourages people to get plenty of exercise and fresh air.ldquoAt times like these, the website reads, ldquoit can be easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour which in turn can make you feel worse.\"Its only warning is not to get too close to other people when outside, asking walkers to stay at least two metres away from each other.Coronavirus: the facts by the World Health Organisation and the NHSWhat is coronavirus COVID- is a respiratory illness that can affect lungs and airways. It is caused by a virus called coronavirus.What caused coronavirus The outbreak started in Wuhan in China in December  and it is thought that the virus, like others of its kind, has come from animals.How is it spread As this is such a new illness, experts still arenrsquot sure how it is spread. But similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. Therefore covering your nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing, and disposing of used tissues straight away is advised. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.What are the symptoms The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. Look out for flu-like symptoms, such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose and a sore throat. Itrsquos important to remember that some people may become infected but wonrsquot develop any symptoms or feel unwell.What precautions can be taken Washing your hands with soap and water thoroughly. The NHS also advises to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleevewhen you cough or sneeze put used tissues in the bin immediately and try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell. Also avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth unless your hands are clean.Government adviceAs of Monday, March , the government advised that everyone should be observing social distancing - avoiding unnecessary travel and working from home where possible. Anyone with a cough or cold symptoms now needs to self-isolate with their entire household for  days.The over s or anyone who is vulnerable or living with an underlying illness are being asked to be extra careful and stay at home to self-isolate.For more information on government advice, please check their website.Should I avoid public places The advice now is to avoid public places and any non-essential travel. Travel abroad is also being advised against for the next  days at least, and many European countries have closed their borders.What should I doI feel unwell Donrsquot go to your GP but instead call NHS  or look online at the coronavirus service that can tell youyou need medical help and what to do next.When to call NHS NHS  should be usedyou feel unwell with coronavirus symptoms, have been in a country with a high risk of coronavirus in the last  days oryou have been in close contact with someone with the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco-take-20-000-new-staff","story":"Tesco has become the latest supermarket to announce plans to recruit new staff to cope with the coronavirus outbreak overwhelming stores.The UKrsquos biggest grocer said it will recruit , temporary workers for at least the next  weeks.Its recruitment drive was launched on Wednesday, adding ldquosince then we have already been overwhelmed by support from the public and thank everyone who has applied to work with us in stores.Some staff are being interviewed, processed and working within the same day, Tesco added.Tescorsquos HR chief, Natasha Adams, said: ldquoIrsquom so proud to be welcoming thousands of new colleagues to Tesco.

insisting that people were complying with the Governmentrsquos social distancing advice by keeping two metres away from others while visiting the scenic coast and getting exercise.One said on Facebook:ldquoIt wasnrsquot mass gatherings at that beach, there was literally no one near anyone.Another added:ldquoWide open spaces like a beach are a great place to get fresh air and exercise while also adhering to social distancing rules, exactly as the Government and chief medical officer advises.It was also suggestedthat it was much easier to keep two metres away from others on a beach than

Chocolate-box we arenrsquot. All around are plots so lush and well-tended they could be entered at Cha. Our patch is not in their league. Looking out to hills at the back, it opens onto a field, where sheep huddle at night under a blackthorn by our gate, leaving wisps of wool every morning. Chicken wire intended to keep out rabbits has been gnawed by marauders for whom our mossy, tufty grass is irresistible. Nor can we grow a dense hedge to discourage them because, wersquove been told, the horses who share the field with the sheep would bring our wooden fence crashing down as they leaned over to munch it. And needless to say, nothing can keep out the nettles, which wave wildly at me after itrsquos been raining, like kids on a school bus.Burying myself in a rose catalogue is a definition of day-dreaming. The David Austin Handbook of Roses, gted by a green-fingered friend, is jam-packed with temptation. One of the delights of summer is to be taken around this friendrsquos delectable garden. A riot of sweet peas, foxgloves and hollyhocks, with soaring old trees casting welcome shade, its walls are swagged with clematis and honeysuckle. Thanks to her, I now go to sleep in the company of roses called Roald Dahl, Tam OrsquoShanter or The Pilgrim, after the Canterbury Tales. Therersquos Gabriel Oak, hero of Thomas Hardyrsquos Far from the Madding Crowd, or the mercurial Eustacia Vye, from The Return of the Native. Planted together, would they get on or would the results be another tragedy  I seem to remember Darcey Bussell was once askedshe would rather be given a damehood or have a rose named after her. She now has both.Vita Sackville-West was a self-confessed sucker for catalogues. The doyenne of Sissinghurst Castle, in Kent, which she turned into a horticultural paradise with her husband Harold Nicolson, she also wrote a very practical gardening column for The Observer. Early in the autumn of  she complained that catalogues were arriving by every post. ldquoIt is dficult to keep onersquos head. I always lose mine.... Experience tells me that I ought to resist, but, like the poor mutt who falls to the card-sharper in the train, I fall to every list offering plants I cannot afford to buy and could not cultivate successfully evenI could afford them.She was at work when nurseries were only reluctantly opening their doors to amateurs and garden centres were almost unheard of. Catalogues were the way to buy seeds, and seedlings, and set your plot up for the coming year. Many folk in Hoolet have their own greenhouses and potting sheds, but itrsquos as much as I can do to plant something bought in a pot and keep it alive long enough for it to learn to fend for itself. I speak encouragingly to each new arrival, hoping that snow and wind donrsquot kill it before the roots have taken, or some night-time critter digs it up for a taste of bonemeal in which itrsquos bedded.When it comes to roses, I was cheered by the poet James Fentonrsquos advice. He wrote a book about growing a garden from  packets of seed, but with one important caveat: ldquoI do not propose that you start your roses in this way: That would be, as Peter Pan says of death, an awfully big adventure.Seed catalogues are for experts and connoisseurs, a higher level of botanical sophistication and dedication than I ever expect to reach. The New Yorker writer Katharine S White was a devoted gardener at her Maine farmhouse where she lived with her husband, E B White. I have a collection of her gardening columns, Onward  Upward in the Garden, which are surprisingly and disappointingly dull. Occasionally, though, she surprises me.Among her prized catalogues were those by the Calornian rose expert, Will Tillotson. He had a very distinctive style. Indeed, as you find your feet in this new field of prose, you discover all these writers become as identiable as Ernest Hemingway or Muriel Spark. Thinking up new ways of conveying the essence of hundreds of roses must be challenging, and Tillotson once showed the strain: ldquoOh gentle reader, he wrote, ldquoforgive meyou are lsquosleepyrsquo or bored or annoyed. The tired catalogue writer has emptied his sack of adjectives at your feet. This phrase was used as the sign-off to his last catalogue, printed shortly after his death. It was a poignant envoi.The David Austin Handbook is also posthumous, carrying the news of ldquoMr Arsquos death at the end of . He was a Shropshire Lad, which might explain the profusion of literary names and references in his glorious collection and the clarity of the puffs for each plant. As with all plant catalogue writers, the descriptions are as glowing aseach specimen was one of the authorrsquos own brood.I donrsquot think of myself as particularly impetuous, but I anticipate a moment when, like Sackville-West, I too might lose my head. The rosette-like iety named after Anne Boleyn would be fitting, but Irsquom drawn to the simpler kind that remind me of dog-roses found in hedgerows: Open Arms, Rosa complicata, Morning Mist, Fru Dagmar Hastrup, or Rosa rugosa alba, the one known as The Jacobite, with its old-fashioned fragrance, innocent white flowers and wicked thorns."},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW  Did Glasgow-set drama The Nest get off to a flying start ","story":"FORGET about the column inches Michelle Mone has racked up, or the seat in the House of Lords.

If your friends ask you to meet, you should say No.You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home.You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine - and you should do this as little as you can. And use food delivery services where you can.If you donrsquot follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.To ensure compliance with the Governmentrsquos instruction to stay at home, we will immediately:*close all shops selling non-essential goods,# including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship*we will stop all gatherings of more than two people in public ndash excluding people you live with* and wersquoll stop all social events#, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals.Parks will remain open for exercise but gatherings will be dispersed.No Prime Minister wants to enact measures like this.I know the damage that this disruption is doing and will do to peoplersquos lives, to their businesses and to their jobs.And thatrsquos why we have produced a huge and unprecedented programme of support both for workers and for business.And I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again in three weeks, and relax themthe evidence shows we are able to.But at present there are just no easy options. The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost.And yet it is also true that there is a clear way through.Day by day we are strengthening our amazing NHS with  former clinicians now coming back to the service.With the time you buy - by simply staying at home - we are increasing our stocks of equipment.We are accelerating our search for treatments.We are pioneering work on a vaccine.And we are buying millions of testing kits that will enable us to turn the tide on this invisible killer.I want to thank everyone who is working flat out to beat the virus.Everyone from the supermarket staff to the transport workers to the carers to the nurses and doctors on the frontline.But in this fight we can be in no doubt that each and every one of us is directly enlisted.Each and every one of us is now obliged to join together.To halt the spread of this disease.To protect our NHS and to save many many thousands of lives.And I know that as they have in the past so many times.The people of this country will rise to that challenge.And we will come through it stronger than ever.We will beat the coronavirus and we will beat it together.And therefore I urge you at this moment of national emergency to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives.Thank you."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11187054.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scottish-research-reveals-mindfulness-key-golf-success","story":"And many believe a huge part of being able to truly get to grips with golf goes on between the ears.Now new Scottish research reveals how crucial psychology is in being able to boost performance, through the evidence of top players.Eight of Scotlandrsquos top male players have revealed the secrets of their success and what goes on in their minds before and after that big shot during professional competitions.In the first study of its kind in Scotland, lead researcher Alex Oliver, a sport and exercise PhD student at Glasgow Caledonian Universitys psychology department, looked at how golfers control their attention, which is vital for successful skill execution.Mr Olivers advice to sportspeople looking to boost performance would be: ldquoDonrsquot force it because thatrsquos when your performance can unravel.\"The research found that the establishment of a pre-shot and post-shot routine helped to offset distractions and is \"beneficial\" to concentration in competition.It also highlights the importance of \"mindfulness training\" to be able to deal with the disappointment of that duffed shot.One golfer explained: \"I drum it into the youngsters coming through because they are the ones that will tell their pals, oh am level after six holes, this is my best-ever after nine.

At some point that information, that facts and that evidence will see the light of day.Sources have already told The Herald that Mr Salmond is set to instruct his trial lawyers, Levy  McRae, to take legal action against the Scottish Government over its handling of the complaints against him.Now the trial has finished, some of what he wanted led in court can be reported for the first time.At a preliminary hearing in January, the defence Mr Salmond hoped to use was laid out by his QC, Gordon Jackson, before trial judge Lady Dorrian.As Mr Salmond sat in the dock, Mr Jackson went through the lines of questioning he wanted to take with female complainers in the case, a standard legal step given the sensitivity involved in questioning them.Mr Jackson said it was a ldquovery unusual case from a ldquopolitical bubble.At its heart was the Scottish Governmentrsquos botched in-house investigation into two complaints of sexual misconduct against Mr Salmond when he was First Minister.After news of the investigation leaked in August , Mr Salmond launched a judicial review into how the Scottish Government ran this investigation.On  January , Mr Salmond won the review after ministers admitted it had been flawed from the outset.Because the investigating official had been in prior contact with the two complainers, the whole process was deemed to have been unfair, unlawful and ldquotainted by apparent bias.Mr Salmond claimed at the time there had been a conspiracy. ldquoSome people are very clearly very anxious to remove me now as a political threat, which is why this is probably not over, he said.Mr Salmondrsquos legal team intended to claim this humiliation for Ms Sturgeonrsquos government spurred a coordinated campaign to discredit him.:Nicola Sturgeon faces profound questions of integrity after Alex Salmond acquittalAt the preliminary hearing, Mr Jackson estimated the ldquoshambles had cost taxpayers up to pound million in legal fees.He said people working in the Government, deeply unhappy at the judicial review outcome, therefore ldquoturned their attention very directly to the criminal process.These people ldquowith a clear motivation sought to influence that process in order to discredit the former First Minister, Mr Jackson said.He said there was a ldquoconcerted effort made by people within the Government to advance the criminal process ldquoas best they could.He said people who did not want to be part of a criminal inquiry, or did not think any crime had been committed against them, or want to complain, were ldquoencouraged to complain.He said the ldquoprime mover was one of the complainers in the indictment.At a further hearing in Glasgow in February, Mr Jackson also quoted a text message from one complainer to an SNP employee: ldquoJeez, think [a complainer] is in trouble. [Salmond] isnrsquot going to stop until he gets her and hersquos bringing down Nicola on the way.After considering Mr Jacksonrsquos proposed questioning, Lady Dorrian disallowed much of it and the judicial review barely featured in the trial.His legal team constrained, Mr Salmond pushed the conspiracy theory when giving his own evidence, saying some allegations were ldquodeliberate fabrications for a political purpose, while others were ldquoexaggerations.Besides Mr Salmondrsquos desire for revenge, Ms Sturgeon also faces two crucial inquiries into her conduct related to the judicial review.After the Governmentrsquos case collapsed in , Ms Sturgeon insisted that she had, rightly, not known about the in-house probe taking place.She said Mr Salmond had informed her about it himself when he visited her Glasgow home in April .She told MSPs the meeting had been a purely ldquoparty matter, not a government one, and so there was no need to have officials present or to report it to her private office ndash a potential breach of the ministerial code which will now be investigated.However, at the trial, Mr Salmondrsquos former chief of staff, who brokered the meeting, said he met Ms Sturgeon in her Holyrood office a few days earlier, something she has never revealed.A Holyrood committee inquiry set up after the review will want to knowMs Sturgeon misled Parliament.Ms Sturgeonrsquos husband, SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, is also facing calls from Mr Salmondrsquos outriders for an inquiry into how the party handled complaints against the former leader.

Indeed, the necessity for them is that unlike citizens, who are considered free to do anything not expressly prohibited by law, governments cannot assume powers without legislation that explicitly grants them.Naturally, there are people mdash the ones under the delusion that the current Government is ldquothe most right-wing ever mdash who see this as a fascist coup along the lines of Kristallnacht. These are often the same people that have been complaining the Government hasnrsquot done enough to tackle the virus, even while declaring that the economic consequences of austerity have killed hundreds of thousands, and despite the fact that these opinions are mutually contradictory.OK wersquove grasped that they take a dim view of Boris Johnson. But even thosewho think the Government has, by and large, handled the crisis fairly well are right to cast a critical eye over these provisions.Almost all governments of every political stripe are reluctant to est themselves of powers once they have acquired them. In America, for example, the provisions of the Patriot Act, introduced hastily and with little oversight after the terrorist attacks of , are still in place, representing a restriction on civil liberties that would have been highly controversial  years ago.So a built-in two-year expiry date, and the undertaking to review the powers at six-month intervals, are essential components of this legislation. And, once this crisis is over, we should remind the powers that be that the extraordinary powers with which the state has armed itself are just that mdash out of the ordinary.Mr Johnson will be aware of the cautionary account given by Livy of Lucius Manlius Imperiosus, appointed dictator in BC to tackle a plague opinion on the epidemiological usefulness of this measure has moved on, who then got too full of himself, and was removed from office and put on trial. The Prime Minister no doubt intends to cast himself more in the mould of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, who, after being appointed dictator in BC, swtly achieved victory, immediately renounced his powers and retired back to his smallholding.The reason that we remember Cincinnatus, and cities are named after him, however, is because his example is such an unusual one. Lord Actonrsquos line about what absolute power tends to do corresponds far more to the normal pattern.Despite that, therersquos a surprising level of idiotic approvalof quite despotic powers, from people who will tell you that ldquothere are no libertarians in an epidemic or that, whenever we face a crisis, the measures that we turn to are basically socialism in action. The objection of the Prime Ministerrsquos critics is not so much to sweeping powers, but the fact that hersquos the one who gets to employ them.Exceptional measures are either necessary or not, and whether you approve of the current governmentrsquos other policies doesnrsquot come into that. If, when the exceptional circumstances have passed, such powers ought to be rescinded, itrsquos because they offer too much power to the government of the day mdash and they do so whatever its political colour.As it happens, we might just as easily learn the opposite lesson from what has happened in response to the pandemic. Some of the action to help us deal with the situation has been a matter of relaxing regulation mdash for example, allowing restaurants and bars to work on a delivery and takeaway basis without applying for a dferent licence, recognising the qualications of retired medical professionals, or paring back the bureaucracy around, to take only a few examples, sick leave, council powers over care duties, death certicates, tax credits, freelance tax s, VAT payments and housing benefit.At a more informal level, too, itrsquos already apparent that some things which have been considered normal practice are less than vital: commuting and face-to-face meetings turn out not to be necessary to many industries, which may even be more productive without them. And despite the irresponsibility of panic buyers, even parts of the economy that cannot be conducted remotely, such as the food supply chain, seem fairly resilient and adaptable.When the time comes to challenge police powers to shut down public gatherings, or other examples of what would normally be overreach, but most of us concede are currently essential, we may also want to consider whether those regulations that were quickly and easily dropped to cope with the crisis were all that useful in the first place.There is a danger of seeing the coronavirus crisis as a way of vindicating all sorts of changes that happen to correspond with the political priorities you already hold. Irsquove seen arguments that it proves the case for almost any hobby-horse: universal basic income, nationalising the railways, increasing teachersrsquo pay, abolishing zero-hours contracts, introducing bans on vaping and junk food and, inevitably, stopping Brexit.We will not be able to know what mistakes have been madein dealing with this pandemic until we have the benefit of hindsight. Nor is it likely that current predictions of quite how the world will change as a result of it are going to be accurate mdash evenwe assume that the world will almost certainly be changed by it.Butwe accept ndash as most responsible people now do mdash that strange and dangerous times justy extreme measures, and demand sacrices and altruistic responses from each of us, then it is because we understand that the circumstances are unprecedented. When we get back to normal, whatever the new normal turns out to be, we must insist that our laws and freedoms do as well.Read more: New figures confirm four more deaths as a result of pandemic"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-many-cooks","story":"GORDON Ramsey was visited by Gino DrsquoAcampo and Fred Sirieix, when the three catering celebs filmed a TV show.

Sentiments such as Mrs Thatcherrsquos have informed the development of society that we have created over this time. The self-centred reaction of many to the current situation is merely one manestation of this.It is revealed in studies such as Geert Hofstedersquos, who found in a global study that the UK had one of the highest scores for inidualist attitudes, ldquobeaten only by some of the commonwealth countries it spawned i.e. Australia and the USA. If we value the inidual more than the collective ndash or dare I say society ndash can we be surprised that when the shops open there is a queue of iniduals outside supermarkets, looking to buy what they, as iniduals consider they need, whether as iniduals or for their own immediate family And of course, this is how free markets work ndash we all pursue our own inidual self-interest.

It is heartening that the former predominates in our community.However, sadly there are sectors where this is not the case and we see opportunistic operators taking advantage to generate profits which are at best questionable. I refer in particular to the short-selling of shares by hedge funds against a background of plummeting global markets as a consequence of the Covid- pandemic.Short-selling is the process by which shares are borrowed by hedge funds from large financial institutions and immediately sold, taking the view that the market will fall before they have to be re-purchased and ed to the rightful owner. The dference between the original sale price and the ultimate buy-back price in a falling market represents the hedge fund profit.

Consider, for example, shares in airlines with planes grounded, cruise companies with ships confined to harbour or travel companies with tourism virtually banned.Investment is defined as the placing of money with a view to profit. Short-selling conflicts with that in that hedge funds are dealing in assets shares which they do not own. The very act of selling large tranches of shares adversely affects and forces down prices and by extension the value of pension fund portfolios in which ultimately we all have an interest.This has been recognised in Spain and Italy where short-selling has been banned. The question has to be asked why no such action has been taken by the regulator in the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority, as regards quoted shares here.It is entirely predictable that in the weeks and months ahead we shall be hearing of exceptional profits earned by hedge funds. At whose cost D Lindsay Walker , Strachur.FOR about the third weekend in a row, the supermarkets in my part of the world have had a fair portion of their shelves left empty, and I have had to mentally adjust my menus for the week. At the same time, the newspapers and the TV news carries pictures of shoppers queueing with large trolleys prior to first light at supermarkets and discount warehouses.Obviously, a proportion of those waiting, particularly at the warehouses, will be corner shopkeepers, looking to replenish their stock. However, the majority appear to be ordinary members of the public, who despite exhortations from the Government and supermarkets, insist on descending like a swarm of locusts.Ive been wondering: is it the same people who have been repeatedly panic buying, or is there a system which allocates a place in the queue at certain times, so dferent folk have been in the line  If so, when will it be my turn Christopher W Ide, Waterfoot.TODAY, on my th birthday, some despicable person stole our early-morning milk delivery from outside the main door of our block of flats in Bearsden.What was to be a very limited celebration has been ruined by the kind of selfish behaviour which has been much in evidence during past weeks.Donald Mackinnon, Bearsden.THE owners of any public house or hotel which has stayed open during this crisis against the guidance and put lives at risk just for their profit should be deemed an unfit person to hold a liquor licence. At their next renewal these facts should be presented to the licensing board who will then permanently remove their licence. With many people putting their lives at risk to maintain essential services the last thing we need are idiots who simply dont care and create a bigger workload.Dave Biggart, Kilmacolm.AFTER reading Mark Smiths articlethis thought occurred to me.My husband and Ihave been in the habit of walking at least three times a week in several of our beautul parks, and afterwards we have enjoyed a cup of coffee at one of the coffee shops on the south side of Glasgow. Many of these are owned by the self-employed.I believe that many pensioners are sitting at home wondering what they can do to help in our current situation. Of course,being at home means less expenditure in many cases. I propose that those who can afford itgive the cost of their cups of coffee and perhaps a wee scone into a fund to help the self-employed at this particular time.Maybe the BBC or some other organisation could help with an effort along the lines of the Children in Need programme where money is donated. If this is not feasible the money could go to a bonus for the NHS staff to show our gratitude when this is all over.Josephine Stewart, Newton Mearns.Read more: Scotland essentially already in lockdown as businesses told to close"},{"url":null,"title":"jeanne-freemans-coronavirus-advice-right---not-exceptional","story":"That, in order to effect real and vital change in the world, you could just sit on your behind, let your blubber settle and do absolutely diddly squat all.Imagine no longer! Your country needs you to be as lazy as humanly possible.Just... stay in your house. Covid- can only be quashedwe self-isolate and socially distance ourselves.And yet, and yet. People still seem incapable of taking the advice fully on board.At the weekend we saw city dwellers flocking to the countryside to take advantage of the lovely weather, and to hang with any germs they might be carrying with them to the remoter parts of the country.There were umpteen social media posts from those who just couldnt bear the pubs being shut on a Friday night and so went to hotels to drink at their bars, and never mind about the bar staff who had to serve them or the housekeeping staff who had to clean up after them.Snowdoniarsquos National Park Authority announced yesterday it has closed its main carparks ldquofollowing the busiest visitor weekend in living memory.The sunshine was part of the problem. Here weve been stuck indoors over a long and storm laden winter. Now, finally, the weather has turned and we had two beautul, crisp, sunny days to play with.Yet we werent meant to play with them. We were meant to stand at the window and gaze out at them, forlornly.The government advice is that a walk outside is good for you so, like others and understandably, I tried on Sunday to go for a walk. The park was hoaching with people and keeping a solid two metre distance was not possible so I ed home.Thats part of the problem with social distancing - it only workseveryone gets on board. If some of us are weaving about and leaping out of the way like Jumping Frenchmen of Maine while others wander blindly in our path, its not effective.The messages from the English and Scottish governments is also conflicting. Late on Saturday night - far too late - Boris Johnson advised that people should not visit their mums for Mothers Day. Stay put, he advised.Scotlands National Clinical Director Jason Leitch, who is excellent, calm, measured and clear, gave his three-step advice for Mothers Day. Dont visit, he said, or try to have a video all with mum. Butyou do visit then wash your hands, have mum wash her hands, and stay two metres away from each other.The upshot was everyone translating the advice dferently - some insisting you cant visit your mother at all, others saying it would be fine.On Friday night Mr Leitch appeared on BBC Scotlands The Nine and said visiting the hairdressers was fine, as salons tend to be one of the more sanitary places you can visit. On Monday Nicola Sturgeon said hair salons should close.The messaging is not straightforward. \"Social distancing\" is relatively meaningless. I saw a great tweet asking why the messaging isnt \"the two metre rule\" - much easier to grasp.What really is easy to grasp, though, is that we should stay at home unless for vital journeys or a bit of solo exercise. All  is paused for now.If you have symptoms and live with other people then  days at home and dont cross the doorstep. Ive come across people who have symptoms and are going out and about as usual. That is unconscionable. Why are they doing it  Because they dont think the rules apply to them and, while they have symptoms, they dont believe them to really be Covid-.Its really moot, for the purposes of the behaviour of the general public, whether its Covid- or not. This is not the time for self-diagnosis or taking chances because you believe yourself to be the exception to the rule.Jeane Freeman MSP put it beautully: \"You are neither an exception nor exceptional.\"This is not the time for bending the rules to suit your bespoke and special circumstances. This is the time for knuckling down and doing exactly whats asked. If you have symptoms and you go outside then your actions could be responsible for a death. Being stuck indoors when the sun is shining is rubbish. Is it worth making other people gravely ill The advice to just stay in your house is more dficult when you live with people you dont particularly like or you have flatmates who are a pain in the behind. Its frightening advice when you live with someone who is abusive.But for the majority of us it just means a prolonged spell of slight tedium, perhaps with some whining weans wed like a break from. In the absolute grand scheme of things, this is not a terrible situation to be in.Stay home and fewer people will die. Be a bit canny, protect your granny."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-uk-lockdown---can-cant","story":"Prime Minister Boris Johnson put Britain on lockdown on Monday in an address tot he nation that outlined strict new measures to curb the spread of Covid-, ordering people to only leave the house for a few specic reasons.- How long will the lockdown last It is thought that the lockdown will last at least  weeks.ndash When can people leave the house People are only supposed to leave the house for four reasons: Infrequent shopping for basic necessities such as food or medicine one form of exercise a day for a medical need or to take care of the vulnerable, and to go to work, but onlythat cannot be done from home.:Coronavirus in Scotland: Police will not hesitate to enforce new lockdown powersndash What shops and public spaces will be open Shops permitted to stay open include supermarkets and other food shops, health shops, pharmacies including non-dispensing pharmacies, petrol stations, bicycle shops, home and hardware shops, launderettes and dry cleaners, garages, car rentals, pet shops, corner shops, newsagents, post offices and banks.Parks will stay open for exercise, but playgrounds and outdoor gym spaces will be closed.-The services that will remain open under current guidelinesParksSupermarketsFood shopsHealth shopsPharmacies including non-dispensing chemistsPetrol stationsBicycle shopsHome and hardware storesLaundrettes and dry cleanersCar rentalsPet shopsCorner shopsNewsagentsPost officesBanks-What can you not do Visit friends in their homeMeet family members who do not live in your homeLeaving home-When can you leave the house Shopping for basic necessities ldquoas infrequently as possibleTo take one form of exercise a day - for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your householdndash What shops and public spaces will be closed The Prime Minister said buying basic necessities such as food and medicine should be ldquoas infrequent as possible and people should use delivery services where they can.In the measures announced on Monday, this means closure for places including libraries, hotels and hostels, hair salons, and shops selling non-essentials such as clothes and electronics, among others.Places of worship will also be closed, apart from to conduct funerals which can be attended by immediate family.ndash What exercise is allowed Exercising once a day is permitted, either alone or with other people that you live with.This can include a walk, a run or a cycle outdoors on the roads or in local parks.:Coronavirus: Boris Johnson tells Britons to stay at home-What social events are banned WeddingsBaptisms and other events including sporting eventsVisiting family members you do not live with.ndash What counts as a medical need Medical needs include travelling to see a doctor or go to hospital, and also going out to give blood.Following Mr Johnsonrsquos address, a spokesman for NHS Blood and Transplant said: ldquoPeople can still donate blood.

Please don#t let name calling, or whatever, put you off getting better informed about this most crucial of matters.At last count  out of the  countries that presently exist have recorded cases#.How do you know who is taking exactly what advice, how many tests are being done or how those governments rhetoric dfers from the actual reality  We have much ignorance and  information in the media, and as always the headless-chicken doom-merchants tell fake tails of doom. Only yesterday a self-ordained fitness person Facebooked about a boy trapped with the corpse of his sister for three days. The actual truth no otherwise healthy child has died worldwide of Covid, not one ever. The boy was a man, the sister was  and died of status epilepticus! Just what possesses people to peddle such tripe is beyond comprehension, but the online media is awash with it.I don#t think anybody knows which governments are taking exactly what advice, how many tests are being done by every one of them or how their rhetoric dfers from the actual reality. I certainly don#t know and never claimed I did. I said the majority of countries are adopting the WHO approach, successfully or otherwise.I appreciateisn#t gospel and apologiseyou, or anybody , has evidence contrary to what they have stated.Time will tell whether this alternative approach has been for better or worse.Ian T # South Korea has followed WHO guidelines, testing more people per capita than anywhere , and the number of new cases there has dropped drastically.The country recorded  new cases of Covid- yesterday, compared with a peak of  cases on February th.I understand there is every chance the virus will spread again in South Koreaonce social contact restrictions are lted, but at the very least their efforts to contain the spread has bought them more time.More time to make sure their NHS and other essential services are prepared as well as possible. More time to acquire testing capability. More time to shield those most at risk from the virus as best as possible.You claim the WHO approach has been unsuccessful. South Korea adopted it and has had more success fighting this virus than anywhere .I appreciate what works in one country may not work where. What concerns me is our governmentshave paid little heed to the likes of South Korea and taken a path at odds with almost everywhere .A failure to adequately explain why has induced panic as much as anything . Now the UK resources are going into the new antibody test. That tells us who is immune, a far far more useful thing to know.For heaven#s sake Helen, we have gone beyond our capacity to trace, let alone test. Whatever did you write your PhD thesis in, headlesschikenology or alarmistscarmongology !Faroes which have fixed links between the islands have  times as many cases as Shetland. May just be coincidence but i would have thought that fixed links help spread disease more quickly.Yes Ian, a car in a tunnel does go a little bit faster than a ferry. So the spread by fixed link will perhaps be accelerated by a few minutes. Now, what probably makes more sense is that Faroe has a population of , rather more than  times that of Shetland., proportionally per head of population,Faroe, fixed links and all is doing rather better than us!!!Ian T.I think you may have accidently hit an extra  there # The current population of the Faroe Islands is c. , Ian, Faroe had a population of , as of June  . Unlike Shetland they are almost certainly testing for Covid- more widely in the community, so it is not possible to directly compare our current figure of  hospital tested cases to their .Whoops, no. I gave the population of Faro!! Portugal!!! Dyslexia rules OK!!!!Just to state the obvious. If you are afraid for yourself,relatives and loved ones. All you have to do is stay inside your house. It is as simple as that.This Virus can not get to youyou do that simple thing. It is not rocket science!!!Yes it can, via an envelope retrieved from a mailbox, groceries and any other items brought into your home that have been handled by other people.There are some strategies you may employ to minimize risk of contamination.Wear disposable gloves when retrieving mail, disinfect the mail before bringing it into your house.Junk mail should go directly from the mailbox to the bin. Retrieve mail only every two to three days to minimize exposure.As to groceries, avoid fresh produce.Wear disposable gloves when shopping.Only buy canned or frozen items and sanitize them before putting into storage.Ideally, buy enough that you can rotate the stock.Use only grocery items, canned or frozen that have been in your possession for  days or more.On the other handyou literally stay in your house and not opened the door to anyone or thing, for the next month or two, or three, or four# the virus probably will not be able to get to you.

It is only permitted when getting to and from work“absolutely necessary”, attending a medical appointment or buying necessities.You will also be able to leave the house once a day for exercise, such as running or cycling. This should be done alone, unless it is with members of your household.If you provide care or help to a vulnerable person you will also be able to leave home for this purpose.If you are a “key worker”, such as a police officer or nurse, and your child children are attending school, you will be able to dropped them off and pick them up.The UK Government says only to travel to and from work“absolutely necessary” - how do I knowit is “absolutely necessary” All those who are able to work from home have been advised to do so, however for many jobs this is not possible. Those providing essential services or goods will still be able to travel to and from work. Social distancing rules, however, should still be enforced. This means you should stay at least two metres apart from anyone and work gatherings should not take place.Will the children of orced parents be able to visit both of them Cabinet minister the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove has confirmed that children under  can move between the households of separated parents, as long as this is normal practice.Can I attend any outside events All social events, such as weddings or baptisms, will not be allowed to go ahead. Funerals will be permitted with only immediate family members in attendance. All social gatherings of more than two people will also be prohibited.What businesses are allowed to remain open Only businesses providing essential goods or services will be permitted to stay open. In the food and drink industry, this includes restaurants operating takeaway or delivery services and canteens at hospitals, care homes, schools and prisons.Facilities offering food or drink to the homeless are also permitted.All retail shops will shut, except for supermarkets and other food shops, pharmacies, petrol stations, hardware shops and laundrettes.Pet shops, newsagents and banks can also remain open.Businesses that are permitted to stay open have been asked to ensure a distance of two meters is kept between customers and shop assistants, to only let people enter in small groups, and to introduce queue control measures outside the premises.Hotels, hostels and BBs can only remain open for those guests staying while their primary residence is unavailable. Key workers can also continue to stay at such accommodation.How will these measures be enforced Police will have the power to disperse public gatherings and issue fines, however it is unclear how officers will monitor whether people are breaking the rules, what action will then be taken, and how much the fines will be.Environmental Health and Trading Standards officers will enforce the rules regarding businesses. Those found to be breaking the rules can be subject to prohibition notices and potentially unlimited fines.How long will the restrictions be in place for The restrictions will be in place for at least three weeks, at which time they will be reviewed. At this stage they could be relaxed or tightened.Many have speculated that the restrictions will be in force for longer than three weeks, such as First Minister Arlene Foster.“If I was a betting person, I would say it would continue long after three weeks. It is right we review what are quite draconian measures.

It is written in the belief that much is possible, even in the face of profound dferences, when there is a genuine commitment to honesty, inclusion and dialogue.”It includes personal memories of Gerry Adams and other central figures in Sinn Fein and the Provisional IRA. Victim’s campaigner Kenny Donaldson said it will have an impact on those who suffered.“No former terrorist should financially benefit as a result of telling a story of how they came to be involved in violence,” said Mr Donaldson.“If the book’s overarching narrative is one of acceptance that there was no legitimacy or justication for the use of violence in the furtherance of or defence of a political objective, then the publication would have value.”Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus updates: Prime Minister orders UK lockdown as third person dies in Northern Ireland Coronavirus: Michelle O#Neill breaks down over threat to cancer patient treatmentClearly Stephen was in a very hard place but we didn#t know, says tragic DJ#s brotherThree men arrested after gardai find a bomb factory in disused quarryCoronavirus: Social distancing will be introduced and shops closed due to #selfish# behaviour, says Swann ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Many parents or carers are waiting up to two years to receive a diagnosis of autism for their child.“This is in direct contradiction to the children’s care pathway which states that all children should be assessed within a -week period.“Early intervention in autism is key to a child having the best outcomes in le.“Autism NI therefore calls on the Department of Health to ensure that the AutismAct  and associated Autism Strategy is implemented fully and the subsequent action plans are fulfilled as promised.”The Department of Health was unable to provide a comment by the time of publication.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus updates: Prime Minister orders UK lockdown as third person dies in Northern Ireland Coronavirus: Michelle O#Neill breaks down over threat to cancer patient treatmentClearly Stephen was in a very hard place but we didn#t know, says tragic DJ#s brotherCoronavirus: Social distancing will be introduced and shops closed due to #selfish# behaviour, says Swann Three men arrested after gardai find a bomb factory in disused quarry,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Stockpiles of Personal Protective Equipmentwere said to be making its way to frontline healthcare workers but those in retail appear to be the ‘forgotten frontline’. The Derry News has spoken to workers in dferent stores who have had to bring their own hand sanitisers or other protective equipment to work. PPE shortages are understood to be widespread across the health service and also include GP practices. The government has made clear that it is making efforts to deliver emergency supplies to hospitals. googletag.cmd.push However, retail workers who are serving thousands of customers every day in a pressurised environment as a consequence of panic-buying have been somewhat overlooked. They are on the frontline too, trade unionists say, and face daily abuse from angry customers upset over food shortages. The Derry News contacted the major supermarkets based in the city to ask what ‘specic measures’ they have put in place to protect staff. In response, Andrew Opie, Director of Food  Sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, which represents all the major supermarkets except for Tesco, said workers have been briefed on ‘strict hand washing’. “Retailers are continuing to adhere to high standards of hygiene, and all employees are fully briefed with measures including strict hand washing policies. This remains the best way of protecting staff and customers,” he explained. googletag.cmd.push When asked to expand on ‘specic measures’ being implemented, a spokesperson for the consortium said that some have drawn up ‘rotas to allow employees to wash their hands at regular intervals’. Meanwhile, Tesco gave assurances that the safety of its customers, colleagues and suppliers is its ‘number one priority’. Strict health and safety processes are said to be in place in its stores and its supply chain and the retail giant is directing all colleagues and suppliers to follow public health authority guidance on how to keep themselves, fellow colleagues and customers safe. Again, it could not say whether hand sanitisers, gloves, masks or other protective equipment would be provided to ensure staff are adequately protected. PROTECTION Derry Trades Union CouncilChairperson Niall McCarroll has called on all supermarket owners and management to provide workers with ‘adequate and fit for purpose’ PPE. He said COVID- will bring many challenges and changes to how we go about our daily working lives. “Some workers will be able to remain at home and shelter against the fast approaching virus. Signicant numbers won’t have the luxury of remaining at home. “Frontline workers is the term used to describe those of us who must face COVID-, keeping keep vital services operating, basically keeping people alive. “One group of frontline workers who are particularly at risk and largely forgotten are supermarket workers. “These workers need protected and above all  they need valued and respected by their employers. “Over recent years supermarket workers have suffered with their terms and conditions of employment being attacked and devalued. With company sick pay being hit hard through cuts from the bosses.” RESPECT DTUC has therefore called on the Retail Consortium to reverse all cuts to workers terms and conditions, by taking control and showing leadership at this time. Mr McCarroll said: “DTUC are calling for full sick pay to be paid to all supermarket workers who are self-isolating or caring for someone at risk. Full sick pay to be paid to all staff regardless ofof service. “For those workers who would be considered to be vulnerable to Coronavirus, those over , any worker with underlying health conditions and pregnant workers should be allowed to self-isolate and work from homethey wish. “These measures would be seen as in the public interest and widely supported. Frontline workers must come before profit.” He continued: “All supermarket workers must also have access to adequate and fit for purpose Personal Protective Equipment. Risk assessments, and widespread testing of all workers within this sector must be seen as a priority. “DTUC ask all members of the public to back the call for supermarket workers to be valued and protected. “Practice social distancing when in store and in the absence of respect from the bosses, show respect to these workers, without them things would be signicantly more dficult.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At Home … We all love being at home, love the homes we have made, love being with our children and families.But to be restricted to being at home can be dficult, to be advised to stay at home and have our normal routine change can be stressful as we wonder how best to manage and live as normal.So here are a few ideas to help keep you sane, to still enjoy your days and be positive …Working at home  Is dficult at the best of times as the washing calls to be put on the line, the dog looks adoringly at you for a walk, the sun and garden beckon etc.But now with your children off too it’s about to get even harder, with demands for play, shouts of I’m bored, he took my doll, she keeps standing in front of the TV.So why not set up a new routine, plan your day to incorporate activities with the children and work time too.Yes you may have to work later than . pm as you’ll be doing less during usual office hours but at least you will get work done.Do explain that you do have to work, and then try activities with them for an hour and then work for an hour, or set up tasks and play activities they can do themselves play dough, creation station, jigsaws, a video about the natural world etc.If you have little ones at home, those under three years, it’s even harder but maybe your teenagers could help If not then you’ll have to adapt the routine to maybe work for half an hour and then play, or set up a play stationnext to you and you can work together.If you have a partner at home maybe you could set up an office in the bedroom or dining room and take it in turns to work and play  Many schools and nurseries have provided work packs for your children to do.Don’t be tempted to rush through these all in one go, do what their teacher suggests.There are many websites who have learning resources you can access too such as The National Literacy Trust’s Family Zone or Twinklwho have a parents page full of resources for those with children aged from birth.I’ll be sharing lots of the ideas and links from these two sites plus more on my Facebook pageas too much information and too many ideas can be overwhelming!Stock Up, forget the toilet roll and tins!Stock up on glue, crayons, pencils, paint, paper , colouring or activity books and real books too, card, sequins and glitter , flour, salt, food colouring, cake making ingredients, bubbles, cornflour for gloop, jelly for jelly play, bag of sand etc!I know most of us already have a Facebook page and use Whats App but do your parents and their friends I know my mum would be ‘gulp’ why do I need them.But these social media sites will ensure that we are all able to keep in touch with each other, that your Mum and mine will be able to see, her Bowling Buddies, your Mums Knit  Natter friends and this ‘keeping in touch’ will be so very importantthey, and we, can’t go out.So do take the time to teach them and their friends as well, maybe consider too using and showing them how to use Skype or Face Time - it’s great to talk but even better to talk and see each other too!Busy, wondering how exactly you are going to keep busy stuck in the house all day Do the ‘jobs’ you’ve been putting off for the past few years!Plan to decorate, spring clean, learn to sew or knitbuild a pond, sort out the garden or, like me get ready to paint your shed yellow!Can you help anyone  An elderly neighbour, the new mum next door, the single dad who has to work in the hospital, the old lady down the road who now can’t walk her dog, the food bank delivery service  It’s greatyou can, just remember though to protect yourself and your family. Invest in two or three garden chairs or benches, old or new it doesn’t matter, pop them by your fences so you and your neighbours can talk to each other!

The scoreline didnt do the Derry kingpins justice, Their tremendous determination and work-rate was enough to see them overwhelm Errigal Ciaran. The Tones never really let the Tyrone champions get a snf of glory. They trailed by - to - at half-time, but that scoreline disguised the fact that they dominated possession in the first half despite battling against a huge wind. The problem was they couldnt score. They hit seven wides to Errigals three in the first half, missed an open goal chance after  minutes, and failed to capitalise on the fact that they won nearly twice as many frees in the opening half. googletag.cmd.push In contrast, the Errigal Ciaran attack, with Eamon McCaffrey at full-forward and Chris Quinn filling the vacant spot at centre-forward, feasted well on the few crumbs of possession they received. As expected, Bellaghy dispatched David ONeill to mark the legendary Peter Canavan at corner-forward. He looked to have his hands full when, after five minutes, The Great fired over a trademark point to open the scoring. But thereafter, Canavan rarely got the better of the Derry county defender who completely dominated him in the air. ONeill received some brilliant support, particularly from corner-back and man of the match Peter Diamond and half-backs Cathal Diamond, Ciaran McNally and Kevin Doherty. googletag.cmd.push Errigal still looked dangerous up front, their scant possession yielding brilliant points from Eoin Gormleyand Peter Loughran. Bellaghy were left wonderingtheyd rue the Louis McPeake fumble which cost them a great goal chance in the opening quarter, after Fergal Doherty and Cathal Scullion had combined to create the opening. Seamus Birts timely introduction of Joe Cassidy greatly increased their powers of penetration. Errigal Ciaran werent helped when driving rain and dimming light, with a . throw-in and a lack of floodlights. The Bellaghy forwards got braver when the second half began. Three superb long-range frees in as many minutes from Gavin Diamond gave them the confidence they needed to capitalise on their possession. Points from Francis Glackin and Cassidy saw them surge three points clear by the th minute. And with key men like Karl Diamond funnelling back to defend in packs, they kept the Tyrone champions scoreless for  minutes of the second half until Mark Hartes consolation goal in injury time. The hammer blow came in the thminute, with Bellaghys goal. Cassidy and Gavin Diamond combined to put Cathal Scullion through, unmarked, to score the goal that ended their losing run in finals.

From this evening people must stay at home except for shopping for basic necessities, daily exercise, any medical need and travelling to and from essential work. Shops selling non-essential goods will also be shut and gatherings in public of more than two people who do not live together prohibited. The UK death toll has reached . It was announced this evening that a third person has died from the disease in Northern Ireland. If people do not follow the rules police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings, Boris Johnson said in a televised statement from Downing Street. googletag.cmd.push The Department of Health said the third patient to die in Northern Ireland was in their late sixties and had underlying health conditions. Health Minister Robin Swann said: “My heart goes out to the loved ones of this patient. “This is the third tragic announcement of this kind I have had to make in recent days. “The lethal threat from this virus is very real and we all have to do everything we can to combat it.” Below is Boris Johnstons full address this evening:  Good Evening, The coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades – and this country is not alone. googletag.cmd.push All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer. And so tonight I want to update you on the latest steps we are taking to fight the disease and what you can do to help. And I want to begin by reminding you why the UK has been taking the approach that we have. Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope because there won’t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses. And as we have seen where, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger. To put it simply,too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it – meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well. So it’s vital to slow the spread of the disease. Because that is the way we reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment at any one time, so we can protect the NHS’s ability to cope – and save more lives. And that’s why we have been asking people to stay at home during this pandemic. And though huge numbers are complying – and I thank you all – the time has now come for us all to do more. From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction – you must stay at home. Because the critical thing we must do is stop the disease spreading between households. That is why people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposes: – shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible – one form of exercise a day – for example a run, walk, or cycle – alone or with members of your household – any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person and – travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home. That’s all – these are the only reasons you should leave your home. You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say No. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine — and you should do this as little as you can. And use food delivery services where you can. If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the Government’s instruction to stay at home, we will immediately: – close all shops selling non-essential goods, including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship – we will stop all gatherings of more than two people in public – excluding people you live with – and we’ll stop all social events , including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals. Parks will remain open for exercise but gatherings will be dispersed. No Prime Minister wants to enact measures like this. I know the damage that this disruption is doing and will do to people’s lives, to their businesses and to their jobs. And that’s why we have produced a huge and unprecedented programme of support both for workers and for business. And I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again in three weeks, and relax themthe evidence shows we are able to. But at present there are just no easy options. The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost. And yet it is also true that there is a clear way through. Day by day we are strengthening our amazing NHS with , former clinicians now coming back to the service. With the time you buy – by simply staying at home – we are increasing our stocks of equipment. We are accelerating our search for treatments. We are pioneering work on a vaccine. And we are buying millions of testing kits that will enable us to turn the tide on this invisible killer. I want to thank everyone who is working flat out to beat the virus. Everyone from the supermarket staff to the transport workers to the carers to the nurses and doctors on the frontline. But in this fight we can be in no doubt that each and every one of us is directly enlisted. Each and every one of us is now obliged to join together, to halt the spread of this disease, to protect our NHS and to save many many thousands of lives. And I know that as they have in the past so many times, the people of this country will rise to that challenge. And we will come through it stronger than ever. We will beat the coronavirus and we will beat it together. And therefore I urge you at this moment of national emergency to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives. Thank you.

From this evening people must stay at home except for shopping for basic necessities, daily exercise, any medical need and travelling to and from essential work. Shops selling non-essential goods will also be shut and gatherings in public of more than two people who do not live together prohibited. The UK death toll has reached . It was announced this evening that a third person has died from the disease in Northern Ireland. If people do not follow the rules police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings, Boris Johnson said in a televised statement from Downing Street. googletag.cmd.push The Department of Health said the third patient to die in Northern Ireland was in their late sixties and had underlying health conditions. Health Minister Robin Swann said: “My heart goes out to the loved ones of this patient. “This is the third tragic announcement of this kind I have had to make in recent days. “The lethal threat from this virus is very real and we all have to do everything we can to combat it.” Below is Boris Johnstons full address this evening:  Good Evening, The coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades – and this country is not alone. googletag.cmd.push All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer. And so tonight I want to update you on the latest steps we are taking to fight the disease and what you can do to help. And I want to begin by reminding you why the UK has been taking the approach that we have. Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope because there won’t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses. And as we have seen where, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger. To put it simply,too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it – meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well. So it’s vital to slow the spread of the disease. Because that is the way we reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment at any one time, so we can protect the NHS’s ability to cope – and save more lives. And that’s why we have been asking people to stay at home during this pandemic. And though huge numbers are complying – and I thank you all – the time has now come for us all to do more.

McCourt and his family made the decision to self isolate almost two weeks ago, after seeing how the spread of the coronavirus has affected other countries throughout the world, and he encouraged the people of his hometown city to heed the professional advice. “If you look at the consistency of all the reports, you can see that you can help everybody by doing the simple things like washing your hands, only going outyou have to go out, not socialising and not going for needless visits,” he said. “If youre helping an older relative or helping someone like a neighbour who cant get out for groceries, then thats fine, but dont just be calling to your mates house to play the Playstation or have a beer. “I think people really need to start listening to the advice were being given because its coming to a critical time. Whether its ignorance or not taking it seriously, over the next couple of weeks there will be no option but to take it seriously because I think its going to start getting serious here.” googletag.cmd.push LethalThe virus can be lethal to older people and those with underlying health conditions and McCourt urged the young people of the city to think about who they could come in contact with.“For young people who are fit and healthy its probably not going to affect them inidually but its who they can pass it onto is the worrying thing,” he continued. “Our club doctortold us that we probably could train and evenone of our lads contracted it, it probably wouldnt do much harm, but its about who he would then take it on and spread it to. That would be the worry so as a football club we decided not to. “I suppose were very lucky to have equipment to monitor the players from home. Seamus McCallion has managed to get all the players a GPS unit where they can still work out at home and they can download it and email it to him and then he reports back to us as a staff. In that respect theres a bit of trust there from staff to players, but on a wider issue, it is really important for people to listen to the advice they are being given on a daily basis. The majority of people are taking it seriously but there is an element, in my opinion, who arent taking it as seriously as they should be.” googletag.cmd.push EncouragementMcCourt has been involved in football for most of his le and whilst temptation to get outside may be there whilst the sun is shining, McCourt encouraged the young sports people of the city to act responsibly to look after their physical and mental health as well as others.“At the minute were still not in complete lock-down, we can still go out, you can still get a ball and knock it up against the wall and do keep-ups. You can go for walks thats the one thing Ive been doing every day,” he explained.“We go for a good long walk, all of us together, and when were out we pick up what we need and were back home. Were probably only out  minutes of the day but thats what we need to do for the foreseeable future. “Hopefully some day well look back on it and say these were crazy times and we got through them unscathed. It is a period of two or three months andyou keep the brain active and keep feeling safe, thats more important at the minute than sport.”McCourt caused something of a reaction on Twitter over the weekend when he stated that he would be getting back into football when this scare ended. The Derry Pele has claried his statement.“I think people picked that up wrong, in terms of trying to come back and playing, certainly not,” he laughed. “What I meant by that is that Im going to get back onto it, playing -a-side or -a-side once this all blows over. In the last  months since I retired, I went straight into that job at Derry, which was very, very time-consuming and still is. “When this does blow over Im definitely going to get back into some kind of playing, whether its just a mess about or playing amateur, because I do miss it now.“Over the last two weeks, weve all had loads and loads of time to think and I probably havent had that time to reflect since retiring because I was out of one job and into the next and it was full steam ahead with that. It will just be for fun and to keep active more than anything.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

McCourt and his family made the decision to self isolate almost two weeks ago, after seeing how the spread of the coronavirus has affected other countries throughout the world, and he encouraged the people of his hometown city to heed the professional advice. “If you look at the consistency of all the reports, you can see that you can help everybody by doing the simple things like washing your hands, only going outyou have to go out, not socialising and not going for needless visits,” he said. “If youre helping an older relative or helping someone like a neighbour who cant get out for groceries, then thats fine, but dont just be calling to your mates house to play the Playstation or have a beer. “I think people really need to start listening to the advice were being given because its coming to a critical time. Whether its ignorance or not taking it seriously, over the next couple of weeks there will be no option but to take it seriously because I think its going to start getting serious here.” googletag.cmd.push LethalThe virus can be lethal to older people and those with underlying health conditions and McCourt urged the young people of the city to think about who they could come in contact with.“For young people who are fit and healthy its probably not going to affect them inidually but its who they can pass it onto is the worrying thing,” he continued. “Our club doctortold us that we probably could train and evenone of our lads contracted it, it probably wouldnt do much harm, but its about who he would then take it on and spread it to. That would be the worry so as a football club we decided not to. “I suppose were very lucky to have equipment to monitor the players from home. Seamus McCallion has managed to get all the players a GPS unit where they can still work out at home and they can download it and email it to him and then he reports back to us as a staff. In that respect theres a bit of trust there from staff to players, but on a wider issue, it is really important for people to listen to the advice they are being given on a daily basis. The majority of people are taking it seriously but there is an element, in my opinion, who arent taking it as seriously as they should be.” googletag.cmd.push EncouragementMcCourt has been involved in football for most of his le and whilst temptation to get outside may be there whilst the sun is shining, McCourt encouraged the young sports people of the city to act responsibly to look after their physical and mental health as well as others.“At the minute were still not in complete lock-down, we can still go out, you can still get a ball and knock it up against the wall and do keep-ups. You can go for walks thats the one thing Ive been doing every day,” he explained.“We go for a good long walk, all of us together, and when were out we pick up what we need and were back home. Were probably only out  minutes of the day but thats what we need to do for the foreseeable future. “Hopefully some day well look back on it and say these were crazy times and we got through them unscathed. It is a period of two or three months andyou keep the brain active and keep feeling safe, thats more important at the minute than sport.”McCourt caused something of a reaction on Twitter over the weekend when he stated that he would be getting back into football when this scare ended. The Derry Pele has claried his statement.“I think people picked that up wrong, in terms of trying to come back and playing, certainly not,” he laughed. “What I meant by that is that Im going to get back onto it, playing -a-side or -a-side once this all blows over. In the last  months since I retired, I went straight into that job at Derry, which was very, very time-consuming and still is. “When this does blow over Im definitely going to get back into some kind of playing, whether its just a mess about or playing amateur, because I do miss it now.“Over the last two weeks, weve all had loads and loads of time to think and I probably havent had that time to reflect since retiring because I was out of one job and into the next and it was full steam ahead with that. It will just be for fun and to keep active more than anything.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

UEFA hope to have European football back up and running by early June at the latest so June  is a realistic target for us at this moment in time.“Together with the clubs and the Professional Footballer’s Association of Ireland, we will work together towards this date and continue to liaise with the NLEC and the PFAI to protect our clubs and players as best we can.“The FAI will continue to work with the Department of Health and the HSE to prioritise the health of our players, match officials, supporters and staff at this time and we will continue to follow all government guidelines.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I also think it is ludicrous that you only have schools and public buildings closed on one side of the border, he said.ldquoI know that from talking to parents last weekend, especially those with vulnerable children, that they are really fearful about sending them to school and into public buildings. People are effectively voting with their feet and taking decisions themselves.Cllr Clarke said elected representatives had to listen to what the public was saying and that confusion had been fuelled by conflicting medical advice from across the globe.He added: ldquoWe simply have to look at restrictions on public buildings and even perhaps how many people go into play parks. This council needs to send out a strong message that it is taking this issue seriously following. We have already cancelled of this weekrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades. We have to start by getting our own house in order.The DUPrsquos Billy Walker mdash who initially said that his party would ldquoreluctantly support the closure of leisure centres mdash subsequently agreed that all council buildings should go into lockdown following the Prime Ministerrsquos statement.He said that in the interests of the publicrsquos health and safety ldquothis is the right thing to do, even though Northern Irelandrsquos chief medical officer, Michael McBride, said that leisure centres could remain openthey were properly managed.ldquoAll the political parties need to work together to make sure that the people out there are properly informed as there are mixed messages. To be honest, some have attempted to turn this issue into and Orange and Green situation and that is wrong, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe bottom line for us all is that we do not want any member of the public to get infected with this virus. We want to come out the far side of this crisis unscathed and prevent as many as people as possible from contracting coronavirus. We have to send out a united message.The UUPrsquos David Taylor said while politicians could ldquodebate all day about who was right and who was wrong in relation to conflicting medical advice, they had to approach the issue in a collective manner and give confidence to the community that they are united in their approach.He added: ldquoThis is not a political issue. It is one that affects each and everyone of us. It is a very serious issue given the potential damage it could cause to peoplersquos lives and we could actually lose some as a result of this. We need to take collective approach and act responsibly.ldquoI have serious concerns about the way the virus is impacting the business community and some of the stories I have heard are frightening, with some businesses down by as much as  percent and jobs at others at risk. We need the Assembly to provide a package of measures to help.SDLP councillor Pete Byrne said that at this time the public need clarity with the overwhelming majority of them of the view that acting early is better than acting too late.ldquoPeople want us to show leadership and while we are taking about closing leisure centres, we have an obligation to protect the interests and health of people and our staff, he said.ldquoWhile I support the closure of leisure centres, we also need to look at community centres, many of which are visited by huge number of our senior citizens for a range of activities and programmes. We need to send out a clear message to people.Cllr Byrne said there also needed to be a focus on the criteria for reopening public buildings following their closure, suggesting that an alternative venue needs to be found for future council meetings to promote social distancing, suggesting the Down Leisure Centre as a possible location.ldquoWhen we close public facilities we are going to push people into parks but we must ensure that there is social distancing in these locations. We need staff there to assure people and perhaps we could redeploy those from our leisure centres to make sure are parks are up to scratch, he added.Cllr Henry Reilly highlighted the great deal of anguish in the community, suggesting that a two-week closure smacked of ldquotokenism as the coronavirus issue will not be over by the end of March.He also highlighted the need to ensure that frontline staff, especially those who work in refuse collection and household recycling centres, are provided with appropriate protective equipment.Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly urged the Public Health Agency to provide information leaflets on the coronavirus to every household in the country, while Alliancersquos Andrew McMurray said his party supported the decision to close all council buildings, excluding those which deliver statutory s.He added: ldquoMoving forward, it is imperative that we enact and support the decision made by the council. On the wider issue, I would ask all residents to follow the advice given by the Public Health Agency, to shop responsibility in order to avoid shortages and to look out for the most vulnerable in our

contact.Volunteers from the foodbank, who are appealing for more donations to help them cope with the increase in demand in what are unprecedented times, are asking people with cars to drive into the car park at Downpatrick Presbyterian Church where the foodbank is based.People are being asked to remain in their cars and once they have handed over their voucher, the food parcel will either be left beside their vehicle or placed in the boot.The volunteers have confirmed that they will also be changing the way they hand over parcels to people who arrive at the foodbank on foot or accept the generous donations people from across the district provide them with.Foodbank co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said people continue to be generous and revealed that she was heartened this week to see collection points the charity has at a number of local stores filled with items.She also revealed that while in the Asdarsquos Downpatrick store yesterday morning, she was approached by a woman who gave her an envelope with money it which her grandfather had donated.Shirley explained the woman approached her after spotting that she was wearing her Fountain Foodbank hoodie.Shirley has been at the

Friday.ldquoOn Tuesday of last week we gave out  food parcels which was busy but not unusual, but suddenly on Friday everyone seemed to panic and there were  parcels given out to help  people.ldquoTo put that number of parcels in context, it was like the Friday before Christmas when we give out around  parcels. This is the only time that we would distribute that many.Shirley said she believes that this is as a direct response to what is happening across the community, explaining that measures had been put in place to restrict the time volunteers speak with people in a bid to protect their health.ldquoWhile I was not there last Friday when people were calling I believe that there was a sombre atmosphere. We gave out a lot of food and we reckon that we will be busy from here on, she continued.ldquoIt has been dficult to replace the food that was given out. We do not have that big a store, but we have managed and it is quite well stocked again just now, but it is dficult. Normally we have financial donations which lets me buy what we need, but there is no long le milk to be had anywhere. It has been hard for me to do that normal shopping for the foodbank.Shirley explained that while she collected an order from the Asda store in Downpatrick yesterday, she was unable to get the quantity of some items that she would have liked.The foodbank co-ordinator saidshoppers would think about the charity when they are shopping it would help, explaining that people are being good, with messages coming in from people saying they will make donations. Shirley said that local churches have also been helping.ldquoThere has been a good response from people which is very much appreciated, but the increase in demand is having an impact on our stock, coupled with the inability to get the food, she said.ldquoPeople should not be panic buying, but it seems to be the way they react at times like this.She said that the Downpatrick foodbank and the Pantry foodbank in Newcastle are anticipating greater need and with people having no jobs and no money coming in, ldquothey are going to be in more dficulty.Shirley added: ldquoEveryone who used the foodbank over the past few months do not have the reserves to go and panic buy, that is why we are going to be busy.Donations can be left at the Fountain Foodbank on Tuesday or Friday mornings between am and noon.

The distance is approximately six miles on an out and back course, majority of the race on the flat with a brutal climb of  feet in half a mile.A new registration venue meant a slight course change which avoided the road section, crossing a few fields and down a lane that took competitors back onto the river path.Leading out the runners was Newcastle ACrsquos Seamus Lynch and Mourne Runnersrsquo Johnny Scott. Once on to the open mountain section, Lynch showed his climbing ability with a one minute lead at the summit before descending with devastating effect, leaving the opposition in his wake and an easy run home along the river bank.The rest of the field swapped places as everyone fought for grip on the steep mountain side.In the ladiesrsquo race it was Newry ACrsquos Esther Dickson who dominated, showing many a good fell runner a clean pair of heels on the descent.At the end of the track back along the river it was Lynch, well in the lead taking his fourth win and third in a row in :, Scott held his position for second in : closely followed by Mourne Runnersrsquo Adam Cunningham in :.Making the top ten for NAC were David Hicks in seventh place in : and Gary McEvoy ninth in :. Also running for NAC was Stevie Rice, finishing in : for th place. The ladiesrsquo race was won by Dickson for the fourth time in a row in : followed by Mourne Runnersrsquo Karalee McBride in : and third was Ballydrain Harriersrsquo Alison Stocks in :.Following on from last weekendrsquos Slieve Gullion race, Newcastle AC again won the team prize.The silly boy award this week went to Hicks, who very nearly wasnrsquot allowed to start the race, having turned up without his mandatory safety kit bag.His only excuse was: ldquoOn ing from injury and a year out, Irsquom just getting back into the swing of things.Fortunately, a quick scramble around the start area saw him beg and borrow enough gear to be allowed to start the race.

It is evident that the church has little or no interest in the public worship of God. What God has commanded is now seen as mere lip service. The Headship of Christ is now openly denied.Letter to the editor : Johnston Press Resell \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...What is equally troubling is that these buildings were erected for the preaching of the gospel. That is now publicly denied.In addition, the planned closure for months indicates the church is effectively irrelevant even to its members and adherents. More troubling are those who within the church are demanding the closures thereby demonstrating that the vast majority of worshippers are unconverted. Equally troubling is the future.If the church has collapsed on this issue, then it will be no surprise that it will equally collapse under persecution.God has tested the public professing church of Christ and it has been found wanting. Exposed as nothing more than pop-Christianity. Also exposed is the  message of healing. All such services have been cancelled to avoid close contact! How pathetic. Rather than close, there should be a dozen services in every building. When I see the elderly who came through a letime of storms bemused at all the snowflakes whose theology is incapable of getting them to church, it is little wonder the buildings are closed. Without a shot being fired or anyone burned at the stake, Christians in general have run away. The backbone of the Puritans and the Covenanters, of Knox and Calvin, does not exist in the Church today. They have all become marshmallows.The church has been judged. It has failed. The crown rights of the Redeemer have been tarnished.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll. It feels tiring and worrying to be soaked once more.But it occurred to me as we left the house early and crawled along with other erted drivers that just a few miles up the road in Pontypridd and indeed in other parts of Wales and across the UK, people are witnessing their homes and business, their lives, being washed away and so as irritated and fed up as I may have been, I scrabbled for perspective.Perspective is a tough one. There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said the local community would become a lsquocrucial support systemrsquo as the epidemic sweeps through the country and vulnerable people are forced to self-isolate.ldquoI spent a pretty uncomfortable  hours wondering whether to try to organise something myself, or even how to do it, and then I came across the Covid- Mutual Aid UK movement, and I realised thatI could then I should, said Jo.She said the group aims to cover every home in Llandough by deploying volunteers to each street, close, and block of flats.To request assistance or offer support, contact: LlandoughMutualAid@gmail.Both groups can be contacted on their Facebook page. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away. For others who have been out for a little bit longer, they may need more of a refresher because, of course, its vital that we keep people safe, thats the whole point of the NHS.\"So the letter will go out today, well then be engaging inidually with all those who respond and I very much hope that many, many thousands will respond.\"From those Ive talked to, I think people can see just how important this is. The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Moy Park says many of these positions could be particularly suitable to those from within the hospitality industry due to an existing awareness and familiarity with food hygiene.Moy Park HR and Performance Director, Kirsty Wilkins said “There has been a noticeable increase in grocery sales as people practice social distancing and self-isolate. This has resulted in a heightened demand for chicken produce and with it, opportunities in the sector to meet this demand. We are committed to ensuring we provide nutritious food for our communities, and we are keen to support iniduals who are looking for short term employment to meet changing consumer purchasing habits.“This increase in grocery retail comes at a time when there has been a fall in demand across our sister sectors of hospitality and tourism as people’s socialising and travel plans are curtailed. We hope the pressure being faced across these industries is short term and, in the meantime, we are keen to help anyone looking for a job through these new opportunities.” Kirsty added: “The health and wellbeing of our team is our most important consideration and we are following all relevant government advice and protocols. This includes increased frequency of the sanitising of communal areas and increased availability of Personal Protective Equipmentacross our factories.“Our business is nothing without the people and the farms who supply us.
