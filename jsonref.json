But the long term implications of the condition are not yet fully understood. Whereas, the risk of being admitted to ICU with Covid in healthy teens is around one in 500,000.Data from the ONS report also confirmed that the vaccines are less likely to stop an infection now than when the Alpha variant was dominant, between December 2020 and May this year.At that time, double-vaccination cut the risk of testing positive for the virus by 79 per cent. For comparison, among those who had beat Alpha, the risk was reduced by 65 per cent.Sarah Crofts, the head of analysis for the Covid infection survey, said in a blog post that the drop in vaccine protection between the two recording periods was likely down to waning of vaccine immunity.She said: \u0027The most recent data... includes results from participants who had experienced a longer average time period since their second Covid vaccination.\u0027If there is any change in vaccine effectiveness over time (such as vaccines wearing off) then it is more likely to have been identified in the latest analysis.\u0027She added that small sample sizes may also have influenced the figures.There were just 99 people in the group who had recovered from the virus between May and August, compared to almost 4,000 among the double-jabbed. To be counted as recovered from the virus, someone had to have not received a single dose of the Covid vaccine.\u0027Additionally, when we estimate the risk of infection among vaccinated people compared to unvaccinated people, we need test results from each group of people.\u0027Over time, more people have received vaccinations and so there are smaller numbers of unvaccinated people to compare with.\u0027Department of Health data suggests some 45.3million people — or more than nine in ten adults — have already received two doses of the Covid vaccine.And almost half of over-50s had got their third booster dose by mid-September, data showed, about a month after they were offered to the age group.Some 3.1million had already received this shot by Sept 16, out of the estimated 6.5million who are eligible. The true extent of immunity against the coronavirus remains unknown. It has been made more difficult to untangle by a series of conflicting studies. A study in Israel published last month found that unvaccinated people with natural immunity were 13 times less likely to catch Covid than double-jabbed people who had never been exposed to the virus before.However, experts at King\u0027s College London found that people with two vaccines enjoy up to 80 per cent protection against infection compared to just 65 per cent in the natural immunity group."},{"url":null,"title":"Funny memes help people cope stress Covid pandemic study claims","story":"Share this article The study, which was published in the journal Psychology of Popular Media, measured how nervous or stressed the American participants felt.Some were then shown three randomly selected memes, while others looked at control conditions with plain text and no

relaxation and cheer, and how much it caused them to think about other information they knew about Covid.Researchers noticed those who viewed memes compared with other types of media reported higher levels of humour and more positive emotions.People who saw memes with captions related to coronavirus were even more likely to have lower stress levels about the pandemic than people who viewed memes without Covid-related captions, the study authors claimed.Professor Myrick said: \u0027While the World Health Organization recommended that people avoid too much Covid-related media for the benefit of their mental health, our research reveals that memes about Covid could help people feel more confident in their ability to deal with the pandemic.\u0027This suggests that not all media are uniformly bad for mental health and people should stop and take stock of what type of media they are consuming.\u0027If we are all more conscious of how our behaviours, including time spent scrolling, affect

live auckland lockdown extended psychosis cases soar in england","story":"Italy has registered 131,585 deaths linked to Covid since the outbreak in February last year. It has the second highest toll in Europe behind Britain, and the ninth highest in the world. The country has reported 4.7 million cases to date. The number of patients in hospital with Covid - not including those in intensive care - stood at 2,428 on Monday, up from 2,386 a day earlier.The analysis, carried out by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), is based on NHS test and trace data as well as ONS survey results for the period between 17 May to 14 August, when the Delta variant was dominant. The results reveal that those who had received two doses of the Covid jabs at least 14 days before the period of interest had a lower risk of testing positive during that time than those who had only had one dose at least 21 days before.  However, two doses of either jab offered a similar level of protection as that provided by a natural infection.  While the two types of vaccine appear to offer different levels of protection, the team urge caution, noting the jabs were given to different age groups and had different follow-up times.It is understood that Nimco Ali, a campaigner and Home Office adviser who is godmother to the Johnsons’ infant son, Wilfred, was at Downing Street over the Christmas period as part of their childcare support bubble. The prime minister’s official spokesperson declined to formally confirm that Ali was there. “As you might expect, I’m not going to get into speaking about iniduals that the prime minister has seen over Christmas,” he said. “What I can say is that the prime minister and Mrs Johnson have followed the coronavirus rules at all times.” However, the spokesperson did say that neither Boris Johnson’s mother – who died last month aged 79 – or Carrie Johnson’s mother were with the family over Christmas. Asked to confirm whether or not Ali was there, he did not respond. “It is entirely accurate to say that they followed coronavirus rules at all times,” the spokesperson said, rejecting the argument that it was legitimate to seek clear answers on the arrangements given lockdown breaches by senior government figures such as Johnson’s former chief adviser Dominic Cummings and the ex-health secretary Matt Hancock. “I don’t accept that,” he said. “We have been very clear that throughout this pandemic the prime minister has expected all ministers to adhere to the guidelines. That is what the prime minister and Mrs Johnson have done, both at this time and throughout, and I’m happy to make that clear.” Downing Street said an increase in coronavirus cases had been expected over the winter and the government would keep a “close watch” on the situation, PA Media reported. Epidemiologist and government adviser Prof Andrew Hayward said the situation was “concerning” and there was “huge potential for the NHS to come under a lot of pressure”. The spokesman said the success of the vaccines meant “we are able to be one of the most open economies in Europe, which is benefiting the public and indeed businesses as well”.Victoria police on Monday confirmed 34 police officers and nine protective services officers had not complied with the vaccination order by the state’s chief health officer and by a specific chief commissioner instruction. Exemptions from having the mandatory vaccine only apply if an employee is unable to be vaccinated due to a medical issue, the force said. Those refusing the jab have been referred to Professional Standards Command for failing to abide by an instruction of the chief commissioner and face subsequent disciplinary action, which may result in their sacking. They have been stood down and directed to take accrued leave. The Police Association backs mandatory vaccinations and has been contacted for comment. Without WHO’s approval the two-dose Covaxin is unlikely to be accepted as a valid Covid vaccine around the world. Bharat Biotech has been pursuing a WHO emergency-use listing for several months, having submitted data on a rolling basis since July. “We are aware that many people are waiting for WHO’s recommendation for (Bharat Biotech’s) Covaxin to be included in the #COVID19 Emergency Use Listing, but we cannot cut corners,” WHO said on Twitter. Bharat Biotech did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Covaxin is one of the three approved vaccines that have been used in India for the country’s vaccination drive for adults.  South Africa has one of the world’s highest HIV burdens, and some studies have suggested that administration of vaccines using the Adenovirus Type 5 (Ad5) vector - which Sputnik V does – can lead to higher susceptibility to HIV in men. Viral vector vaccines such as Sputnik V use modified viruses as vehicles, or vectors, to carry genetic information that helps the body build immunity against future infections, Reuters reported. SAHPRA, the regulator, said it had asked for data demonstrating Sputnik V was safe in settings with high HIV prevalence, but that it had not received enough to establish this. “SAHPRA resolved that the … (emergency) application for Sputnik V … not be approved at this time. SAHPRA is concerned that use of the Sputnik V vaccine in … a setting of a high HIV prevalence and incidence may increase the risk of vaccinated males acquiring HIV,” the statement read. The Gamaleya Institute, which developed Sputnik V, said: “Concerns about the safety of Ad5-vectored vaccines in populations at risk for HIV infection are completely unfounded,” adding that SAHPRA would get all the information it needed. More than 250 clinical trials and 75 international publications confirm the safety of vaccines and medicines based on human adenovirus vectors, the institute added.School leaders’ unions are concerned that 12- to 15-year-olds in England are missing out on getting a Covid vaccination in school due to a high level of cases among the cohort, as well as logistical problems with vaccination teams having insufficient staff to deal with students needing jabs. Three million pupils aged between 12 and 15 across the UK are eligible to receive a first dose of the Covid vaccine as part of a rollout that began a month ago. James Bowen, the director of policy for school leaders’ union NAHT, said:  Ali insisted “I did not break any rules” after a report in the US in Harper’s Magazine claimed she “spent Christmas with the couple at No 10 despite pandemic restrictions on holiday gatherings”, PA Media reported. The north-eastern port has been the focal point of protest in Italy over the introduction of rules last Friday that require all workers show either proof of vaccination, a negative coronavirus test or recent recovery from infection. Police in full riot gear moved in this morning after several hundred dock workers disrupted access to one of the main gates at Italy’s largest commercial port, Reuters reported. The crowds were pushed aside by jets of water followed by volleys of tear gas. Many of them headed towards the city’s main square to continue their protest in front of government offices. “They attacked us. I am speechless. I never expected it,” said Stefano Puzzer, the spokesman of the port protesters. “We will sit down here. We are keeping calm. We will not give up.” The government says the mandatory health “green pass” is needed to keep workers safe and to encourage more people to get vaccinated. Under the rule, effective until year-end, workers will be suspended without pay and face a fine of up to €1,500 if they try to work without the certificate. Most Italians support the provision, opinion polls show.An interesting story from my colleague Mostafa Rachwani this morning, in case you missed it. In Australia, the Northern Territory chief minister, Michael Gunner, has hit back at US senator Ted Cruz who criticised the Northern Territory’s vaccine policy, telling the firebrand Texan conservative “you know nothing about us”. The spat began when the US Republican shared a video of Gunner announcing the territory’s wide-ranging vaccine mandate for workers. “Inidual liberty matters,” Cruz declared, adding he had considered Australia the “Texas of the Pacific”. Gunner did not appreciate the feedback, responding on Twitter with a statement sharing a “few facts about Covid down here” and tagging Cruz. “We don’t need your lectures, thanks mate,” the chief minister began. “Nearly 70,000 Texans have tragically died from Covid. There have been zero deaths in the Territory. Did you know that? “We’ve done whatever it takes to protect the Territory. That’s kept us safe and free. We have been in lockdown for just eight days in 18 months. Our businesses and school are all open. Did you know that?” Gunner went on to say that Cruz knows nothing about Australia, and criticised his stance on vaccination. Russia topped the symbolic figure of 1,000 daily deaths on Saturday for the first time since the start of the pandemic, and hit a new record in infection numbers on Monday with 34,325 cases reported. Officials say the country is quickly running out of hospital beds and Russia’s chief doctor, Denis Protsenko, described the situation on Friday as “near critical” with vaccinations at a standstill. Several regions re-introduced QR codes for access to public places last week as well as mandatory vaccination for certain groups, but Moscow and St Petersburg - home to by far the biggest clusters of infections - have so far opted against new measures. The two cities are among most open places in Europe. “Russians have consistently shown more concern about the economic situation than the epidemiological one,” said Christian Fröhlich, a sociology professor at Moscow’s Higher School of Economics who studies public dissent. “People have very low expectations from the government and don’t expect to receive any support during a lockdown. This helps explain why many prefer for the country to stay open despite the deaths.” Read more of Pjotr Sauer’s report from Moscow here: ‘You reap what you sow’: Russians party despite record Covid figures That is all from me today, I will be back tomorrow.

But Ian Jones reports for PA Media that figures for England and Scotland – the two nations currently publishing daily statistics on take-up – show wide variations across the countries. Take-up is also likely to have been affected by the level of infection circulating in the community. A first dose of vaccine cannot be delivered to someone if they are within four weeks of testing positive for Covid-19, waiting for the results of a coronavirus test, or self-isolating. Around one in 10 children in England in school years 7 to 11 were likely to have tested positive for Covid-19 in the week to 9 October – the highest rate for any age group – according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics.Von der Leyen goes on to say that she will be pressing world leaders at the G20 summit in Rome next week on the issue.Although the return to classrooms is a welcome change for parents and teachers, there are concerns that younger children will face social challenges heading back. With only two months left of the school year, she said her focus would be on getting him into the rhythm of school again and out meeting friends. “We’re excited … we’re excited to go back to the new normal. It’s a fresh leaf, a new chapter,” she said. Schools will look a bit different. Masks are now mandatory for high school students, and are recommended for primary school children. Teachers have been asked to keep the windows open for ventilation, but some classrooms have locked windows, and some worry about what will happen in summer when the temperatures soar. Kastner runs Australian school mums, a Facebook group with 5,000+ members, and says a lot of parents are confused about masks and concerned private schools in the state will get air purifiers while other schools may miss out.

The population of Russia is around 144 million peopleIn new phase 3 results reported today, Valneva said its vaccine showed superior neutralising antibody titer levels compared with the comparator vaccine from AstraZeneca. The company also said its vaccine – VLA2001 – induced broad T-cell responses, a part of the immune system believed to be involved in long-term immunity. PA Media reports that the phase 3 trial recruited 4,012 people across 26 trial sites in the UK. Thomas Lingelbach, the chief executive officer of Valneva, said: “We are committed to bringing our differentiated vaccine candidate to licensure as quickly as possible and continue to believe that we will be able to make an important contribution to the global fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.” Last month, the UK government scrapped a deal for Valneva’s vaccine, with health secretary Sajid Javid telling MPs it had been “clear” the vaccine “would not get approval” by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"extraordinarily mild october weather set to end on thursday","story":"Swimmers enjoying the mild autumn weather in Greystones, Co Wicklow, on Sunday. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe The mild weather which has made this one of the warmest autumns on record is due to end on Thursday. A series of tropical maritime air masses from the south-west has brought temperatures more akin to the middle of summer. A high of 19.2 degrees was recorded at Carlow on Sunday and temperatures were up to 19 degrees in the Phoenix Park in Dublin on Monday morning. This is between five and seven degrees higher than the average for this time of year. Currently every weather station in the State is showing temperatures well above the long term average for October. Phoenix Park is currently recording a temperature of 12.5 degrees for October, the average being 10.9 degrees.Oak Park in Co Carlow’s average temperature for the month at 12.1 degrees is two degrees higher than normal and in Cork it is 11.8 degrees, 1.5 degrees higher than normal. Met Éireann forecaster Emer Flood said there has been a series of tropical air flows over Ireland during the autumn. The normal weather pattern is for cooler air masses from the north to be over Ireland during the autumn bringing rain and lower temperatures. Normal service will resume on Thursday as Atlantic low fronts bring fresh, blustery weather and highs of only 12 degrees. The unsettled weather will continue into the weekend with wet, breezy conditions at times as showers and spells of rain spread from the Atlantic.The extraordinarily mild October follows on from one of the warmest September on record with temperatures well above normal everywhere.Eleven weather stations in the Republic had a record-breaking month, while temperatures in Northern Ireland were equal to the previous record from 15 years ago.The 27.9 degrees recorded at Shannon Airport on September 7th was the highest temperature reported at the station in September there since records began and nine other stations had their record temperatures for that month on that day.All mean air temperatures across the country were above their long-term average (LTA) for the month of September and are likely to be similarly above average for October.Deviations from mean air temperatures ranged from 1.1 degree (14.3 degree mean temperature) at Malin Head, Co Donegal to 2.3 degrees (15.5 degrees mean temperature) at Phoenix Park in Dublin.Mean temperatures for the month ranged from 13.6 degrees (1.6 degrees above its LTA) at Knock Airport, Co Mayo to 15.7 degrees at both Sherkin Island, Co Cork (1.4 degrees above its LTA) and Shannon Airport (1.5 degrees above its LTA)."},{"url":null,"title":"covid certs and masks on agenda says taoiseach as nphet discusses lifting remaining restrictions","story":"Taoiseach Micheal Martin said he was a ‘strong believer in antigen testing’ and its further use would be considered by the Government over the next 24 hours: Brian LawlessPA WireTaoiseach Micheal Martin has said the continued use Covid certs and mask-wearing was “certainly on the agenda” as the Government is set to decide on lifting further restrictions amid rising hospitalisations. He was speaking on Monday as the National Public Health Emergency Team meets to consider its advice on Friday’s planned easing of Covid-19 restrictions amid a rise in cases.Mr Martin said he was a “strong believer in antigen testing”and its further use would be considered by the Government over the next 24 hours. “I am a strong believer in antigen testing . Our public health officials have a more moderated perspective on the value of antigen testing. But some sectors have rolled out antigen testing and that is something that the Government will be considering as well over the next 24 hours”.Speaking in Co Sligo Mr Martin said he did not accept suggestions that this week was Groundhog Day with people once more facing uncertainty.“It is not Groundhog Day. I do not accept that presentation that has been made because of the fact that the economy has rebounded very significantly and in a very fast way because of the re-opening of society that has occurred over the last number of months and that has to be acknowledged.”“But Covid has many twists and turns. We are witnessing another now at this particular time which will give us pause for reflection”.The Taoiseach acknowledged that the rise in hospitalisations and admissions to ICUs is causing concern but said the Government wanted to provide clarity on Tuesday on the easing of restrictions .Mr Martin insisted that it had not been a mistake to herald October 22nd as a date for the lifting of all restrictions. “Back then we were on a very good trajectory and up to last week public health (advice) was positive enough about the ways things were going”.“This isn’t an absence of clarity- essentially it’s that Covid is behaving in a certain way. It has caused an increase in cases , an increase in the number of hospitalisations. So we do have do give it consideration”, he told reporters. He said advise by public health officials wil inform Cabinet decisions on Tuesday.The Taoiseach was in Co Sligo to officially open the new €140 N4 Collooney to Castlebaldwin road project which has replaced a stretch of road which claimed 30 people over three decades .Reset button Earlier the HSE chief executive has said it is “time to hit the reset button. Paul Reid joined other health experts in calling for caution as the Government contemplates the planned lifting of almost all remaining restrictions, due on October 22nd.On Friday, almost all remaining Covid-19 restrictions are due to be lifted, including requirements for social distancing and restrictions on how many people can attend indoor venues. Mr Reid said there were 482 Covid-19 patients in hospital, with 74 in intensive care on Monday morning. On Sunday night, just 11 ICU adult beds and one paediatric ICU bed were available in hospitals across the State as Covid-19 patients accounted for more than a quarter of total capacity. Seventeen hospitals had no free ICU beds.Nphet is meeting on Monday afternoon to consider its advice on reopening, while the Government will also be discussing how vaccine certificates, booster shots and Covid testing can be used as it comes to its decision. While the Government is keen to expand the vaccine booster programme to more vulnerable groups the “green light” from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) is awaited on this. Niac is also meeting on Monday.Ministers will make decisions on the next phases of reopening following Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Mr Reid made his comments on Twitter after the Government chief scientific adviser Prof Mark Ferguson said those planning to attend nightclubs when all remaining restrictions are lifted must be vaccinated “for their own protection”. Prof Ferguson said if nightclubs reopen they should have good ventilation, ideally including an air exchange system which disinfects air, possibly by fitting UV lights to filters. Prof Ferguson also advocated the use of antigen testing which he called “really useful” as it provided “an extra layer of protection”.While he said it had a role in combating Covid-19, he said it was not a solution and pointed out that antigen testing in the Netherlands had not been successful. On Monday afternoon, infectious diseases expert Prof Sam McConkey added his voice to those calling for caution in the reopening process. Prof McConkey said the “shocking and disappointing” rise in Covid-19 hospitalisations and ICU admissions were disrupting regular hospital services.A quarter of the country’s ICU beds were now being used to treat people with Covid-19, he told RTÉ radio’s Today with Claire Byrne show which disrupted “regular care” for those who were very ill.This was not a good situation to be in, he warned, as flu season loomed.October 22nd should not be viewed as “freedom day” because measures such as ventilation, mask wearing and physical distancing needed to continue in society.According to the HSE Covid Tracker App in the last 24 hours there have been 29 hospital admissions 14 hospital discharges seven ICU admissions and just two ICU discharges. In the last seven days tests of 142,364 people revealed a positivity rate of 8.4 per cent. Infectious diseases expert Prof Paddy Mallon said that some restrictive measures would be needed to contain the Covid-19 virus and allow a return to “normal” life .Society was going to have to be innovative and he was supportive of everything that could enable people to live a more normal life, he told Newstalk Breakfast. But Prof Mallon questioned why Ireland remained an “outlier” when it came to antigen testing. Testing and treatment were two key elements in the fight against a virus as even vaccinated people could still contract and transmit the virus. Widespread antigen testing would give added protection, he said.Prof Mallon said the solution was not “all or nothing” with regard to restrictions and there needed to be a broader dialogue about the measures and the need to continue them in daily life to contain the virus. Also commenting on Twitter on Monday morning, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said it was “really great to hear of a substantial increase at walk-in vaccine centres at the weekend, while 3,000+ registered for the first time last week”. He said booster vaccines were continuing among those aged 65 plus in long term residential care, and those aged over 80 years in the community. “College pop-ups continue also,” he added. Meanwhile in Northern Ireland, four further deaths of patients who had previously tested positive for Covid-19 have been reported. The North’s Department of Health said there were also another 966 new cases of the virus in the last 24-hour reporting period. – Additional reporting: PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Growing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"have denial violent sickness british society","story":"As everybody debates the security of MPs and the tenor of our politics, we are in danger of missing a broader point. For we ought to be asking ourselves: what sort of society have we become?The suspect in the murder of Sir David Amess has been detained under the Terrorism Act and police have said that early investigations suggested a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism. We may not know the full details of this terrible crime for some time, but sadly, by then, our attention will probably have moved on.After the conviction of Wayne Couzens, for example, the police officer who murdered Sarah Everard, the country agreed the police had to change. Yet last week it emerged that West Midlands Police refused to answer Freedom of Information requests asking how many serving officers had been charged with rape. The answer, when it was dragged out of them, was three – in just one force – in the last three years alone.The examples go on. Five years ago, Jo Cox was murdered by a neo-Nazi, but the threat of violence from the extreme Right is growing. And this is not even our greatest danger. In Cox’s former constituency, Batley and Spen, a teacher remains in hiding after showing depictions of the Prophet Mohamed in a lesson, and the recent by-election there was marred by sectarian campaigning.We are in denial about the sickness of our society. We choose not to accept the reality before us – that hate, extremism and violence are commonplace – because that reality is scary, and confronting it is complex and hard. For many politicians, it means grasping issues that they find embarrassing, and saying what they lack the bravery to admit.This is especially apparent when it comes to hatred and violence perpetrated in the name of Islam. After so many plots and attacks, we have become inured to bloodshed. The pattern is always the same: we have a brief period of anguished conversation before returning quickly to normal.Commentators raise economic and social exclusion, but the perpetrators are often educated and well-off. Some raise foreign policy, as though extremism is caused by the wars of the last 20 years, rather than the other way round. Some blame our imperial history, as though Britain, uniquely, is targeted for crimes we committed, uniquely, centuries ago. Tell that to the people of Norway, who suffered their own terrorist atrocity last week.In other criminal contexts, we call this victim blaming. Instead, we need an honest conversation about why the attacks keep happening. After all, the danger mostly comes from citizens born and raised in Britain, educated in accordance with liberal and pluralistic values, and given all the opportunities of an open, modern economy.Over the last decade or so we have started to recognise the role played by extremist ideology. Where once we focused only on the sharp end – investigating terror plots, trying to stop bombs – we understand better the need to tackle the ideology behind the threat: the ideas of Sayyid Qutb, the Muslim Brotherhood and the iniduals and organisations related to them.But this is faint praise. We were foolish to tolerate this ideology for so many years. Even now, politicians and the public sector engage, sometimes deliberately, sometimes through ignorance, with people and organisations to whom they should be giving the cold shoulder. As they do so, they confer legitimacy and perceived power to extremists, and weaken those who would stand up to them. Without continuing political leadership, the public sector will keep falling into this trap, often from fear of being labelled an Islamophobe.Yet even focusing on ideology gives us false comfort. It is reassuring to say that we distinguish between the ideology of Islamism and the great religion of Islam. But people who are not Islamists can perpetuate extremist beliefs.Hardline attitudes and behaviour among some “community leaders” are often tolerated by those who would be first to condemn them in almost any other context. Barely disguised homophobia, misogyny and anti-Semitism, discrimination against others based on their race, religion or lifestyle, and the threat of violence towards apostates and atheists, is all too common, yet all too rarely confronted.This cultural extremism is if anything as dangerous as the ideology. It is more prevalent and easier to excuse. And it creates an environment in which ideological and violent extremism can grow. In addition to Batley, we have seen the intimidation of teachers who educate pupils about homosexual relationships, isive community politics in places like Tower Hamlets, and the Trojan Horse plot in Birmingham, where hardliners took over secular state schools.Extremists wrongly claim that Islam and the West are fundamentally at odds, and say any criticism of their beliefs is a criticism of Islam and all Muslims. But the real ide is not between Muslim and non-Muslim, it is between those of us who accept the principles of living in a pluralistic society – and the norms and institutions that make it possible – and those who do not.To live in a pluralistic society is to accept a fundamental deal, in which you accept responsibilities, not just rights. You cannot just live how you choose to live, you have to respect others’ right to do so, too. And you have to respect our values, institutions and way of life: the rule of law, democracy, equality, free speech and respect for minorities.This is the real ide, and it must determine our response to extremism. We need a positive and self-confident account of our national story. And we need to accept that an “us-and-them” ide does exist, but we must decide where to draw the line. Choose the right side, choose pluralism and tolerance, we should say, and we will support you with everything we have. But choose hatred and intolerance and we will come down on you like a ton of bricks.Nothing about this problem is easy. Turning these principles into action, and making our society resilient in response to extremism, will be tough. But the first step is surely honesty about the sickness of our society.This time we must not retreat, in an absence of courage and thought, into complacency. We must admit and confront the very serious dangers we face.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Southend to be granted city status in wake of Sir David Amess\u0026#39s killing, Boris Johnson says as he leads tributes - watch liveWatch: Prince George is learning about extreme weather, says Prince of WalesBBC staff afraid to speak out on gender issues amid Stonewall links, says its own reporterFrance sets two-week deadline for Britain and Jersey to grant fishermen more licencesWe are having the wrong conversations about extremism in BritainMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"giving last rites emergency service","story":"Hearing news of the attack on Sir David Amess last Friday, Father Jeffrey Woolnough rushed to the scene and asked if he might enter to give the MP the last rites. He says a policeman radioed in the request but it was denied. Fr Jeffrey, who did not know what condition Sir David was in – last rites are not performed on the dead, though, had the person just died, or if there was a doubt, the priest can anoint and absolve – respected this decision and prayed the rosary outside.I wrote to Essex Police to ask why they might turn away a priest tending to a believer and if they had a national policy on this subject. They replied that it was critical to protect the integrity of a crime scene and to allow emergency services to attend those in need, adding that “access to the scene is at the discretion of investigating officers”. This was confirmed to the  by the College of Policing, which states that currently there is no national guidance with regards to priests giving the last rites in such conditions.I find this incredible. And, as a Catholic myself, frightening.What’s all the fuss about? To Catholics (and some Protestants) the last rites are a final chance for a person to make their peace with God – confessing their sins, being absolved of those sins by the priest and receiving holy communion. (Sometimes, this isn’t physically possible, in which case we leave matters in the hands of the Lord.) The knowledge that one exits this world in a “state of grace” comforts the dying and their relatives.If it all sounds a bit bizarre, think of it in psychological terms: the Church is our family, God is the father, and all of us want to be close to our loved ones at death. To believers, the soul is actually more important than the body – thus the priest, in a sense, is an emergency service and should be treated as such. Many Catholics carry a card with them that states that if something awful happens, they want a priest present. I’ll be putting one in my wallet from now on.The lack of a national policy on the last rites implies that whether or not a priest gets access to a dying person might depend upon circumstances (understandable, because one doesn’t want to impede the police from doing their job) – or else, which is far less forgivable, upon the religious literacy of the inidual officer on duty.A few decades ago, in most situations I can imagine the police waving a priest through the barrier because they knew who and what he was and why it was so necessary that he be there. But in an era in which Christians are in a diminishing minority – and Christianity as mysterious to most Britons as voodoo or Morris dancing – this knowledge can no longer be assumed. This makes any absence of guidelines totally unacceptable. Time to write some.No one is second-guessing what the circumstances were on that horrible day I merely make a plea for religious belief to be understood for what it is to those who hold it, which is to say more important than life itself. Essex Police has a Twitter banner stating that it values “difference”. Hopefully this applies to Christians, too.Fr Jeffrey is a member of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham, a society for former Anglicans, and Dr Nazir-Ali, who has converted to Catholicism after many years as a senior bishop in the Church of England, is about to join the ordinariate, too. It’s no coincidence. Ordinariate priests tend to have a bit of bottle – they gave up money and friends to become a Catholic, so they clearly and confidently believe in Catholic teaching.What will the English hierarchy make of Dr Nazir-Ali? An outspoken social conservative, he has left a Church that isn’t so sure what it believes any more to join a Church that knows what it thinks but prefers to keep quiet about it. The fact is that my Church’s teachings are exotic and stubborn (not just an unfashionable opposition to abortion but things like pilgrimages and holy wells that elites find risible), and much of the hierarchy – reluctant to contradict the spirit of the age, or even desperate to accommodate it – communicates its faith in language that is deliberately vague and inoffensive. A basic reason why people don’t know what the last rites are is because the Church has stopped telling them.The  hosted an event for my new book last week which you can now see on YouTube, and one of the questions our brilliant readers asked was: “What does more damage to tradition, communism or liberalism?” It’s the difference between tossing a frog on a fire and slowly boiling him. Revolution vs an imperceptible change that one might confuse for a warm bath.The culture of choice is so enticing, so easy, and the liberal society so focused on the present, that the idea of a world beyond this one has, for millions, become simply redundant. Yet the older I get, the more grateful I am for talking bushes and dog-headed saints – the beliefs that bring colour to a life led not for its own, brief sake but for the hope, someday, to look upon the face of God.

One of the 2017 London Bridge attackers’ extremism was so well documented that he appeared in a Channel 4 undercover programme: ‘The Jihadis Next Door’.Sir David Amess MP’s alleged assailant, meanwhile, was previously referred to Prevent, the Government’s counter-radicalisation strategy. Forget ‘lone wolves’ - try known wolves.As with the rest of the regrettably long list of attacks we’ve experienced, many will ask whether the authorities missed some crucial opportunity to avert tragedy. At this stage, so little is known that jumping to grand conclusions is a risky business. Nevertheless, police are investigating ‘Islamist extremist’ motives and it seems the suspect, 25 year old Ali Harbi Ali of Kentish Town, was offered one-on-one mentoring through Prevent after being referred while still in Sixth Form.It is important to note that Prevent is not the security services and a referral means no offence has yet been committed, so reaching Prevent would not have put Harbi Ali on any watchlist or investigation that might somehow have thwarted his plans. He was referred to the voluntary scheme as a teenager and is not suspected of acting until years later. This is categorically different to say, Sudesh Amman, the jihadi tailed by armed police in the moments leading up to his botched martyrdom operation in Streatham.It also demonstrates the complexity and difficulty of attempting to intervene to prevent radicalisation, or to deradicalise the growing number of extremists in our prisons. On this, supporters of such schemes and interventions must carefully manage expectations. There is no blueprint or silver bullet for erting or undoing radicalisation, for changing beliefs and a person’s entire moral framework. You can’t just put someone in one end of such a programme and expect them to come out the other end a democratic, law-abiding citizen.This is particularly the case when there is so much confusion over how people become radicalised in the first place. Too many of our current assumptions downplay the inidual agency of terrorists, casting radicalisation as an involuntary process akin to grooming, a form of hypnosis caused by mere exposure to online content or caused by structural factors which ‘drive’ unthinking people to violence.These assumptions have profound implications for counter-terrorism policy and risk distracting from the realities of both a domestic Islamist extremist scene and a networked jihadi population which has been steadily growing and recruiting in Britain over the past two to three decades - long before any ‘slick’ ISIS propaganda emerged.Neither this movement, nor the iniduals who commit acts of violence in its name, are likely to have been motivated by abusive tweets or anonymous social media accounts, as toxic as they are, even if it makes for easier, more comfortable discussion than reality.Britain and her allies will face more jihadist terror in the coming years - that much is for certain - but we cannot hope to push back until we are more serious about tackling the ideological roots of the violence, more realistic about how people become radicalised, and more honest about our existing schemes to reverse it. Liam Duffy is a researcher, speaker and trainer in counter-terrorismMore from NewsPolitics latest news: Southend to be granted city status in wake of Sir David Amess\u0026#39s killing, Boris Johnson says as he leads tributes - watch liveWatch: Prince George is learning about extreme weather, says Prince of WalesBBC staff afraid to speak out on gender issues amid Stonewall links, says its own reporterFrance sets two-week deadline for Britain and Jersey to grant fishermen more licencesFormer US Secretary of State Colin Powell dies from Covid complicationsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"boris carries tier 4 busting","story":"Boris and Carries Tier -busting Christmas Day denial smells like festive porkie piesBoris Johnson and his we Carrie may be denying any wrongdoing in having their friend Nimco Ali visit Number  on Christmas Day, but what a kick in the teeth to the millions of us who went without family and friends for the greater good, writes Flic Everett and Carrie Johnson walk along the beach\" content\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES n _JS.jpg\" width\"\" \"\" Boris and Carrie Johnson found themselves in hot water after it emerged their friend joined them in Number  for Christmas Day  - despite London being in Tier  lockdown Image: Getty ImagesopinionByFlic Everett:,  Oct | commentsLet’s start with denial, a state with which our Prime Minister is comfortably familiar.According to Boris and his we Carrie, they spent last Christmas all alone, much like many of us in the UK.There were no visitors, no fun and the chief excitement was translating A Christmas Carol into Latin to amuse little Wilfred. According to US Harper’s Magazine, however - which being American has fact-checkers coming out of its jewel-encrusted ears - the PM is telling festive-spiced porkie pies.According to the magazine, Nimco Ali, their friend and godmother to Wilfred, secretly spent last Christmas at Number . A spokeswoman for Carrie Johnson, however, snaps: “The PM and Mrs Johnson have followed coronavirus rules at all times. It is totally untrue to suggest otherwise.”How do you feel about the news the Prime Minister had a friend join them on Christmas Day  Have your say in the comments below Their definition of ‘rules’ can be hazy though, as we all know. In fact, it’s not the first time Tory-supporting campaigner and FGM activist Ali has hit the news. Last year she was appointed the government’s adviser on tackling violence against women and girls. It later emerged that she had been given the job via a “direct appointment process”, without any advertisement or competition for the £-a-day role.Employment ethics aside, when Ali was allegedly enjoying the prime ministerial mince pies, the PM’s subjects were not so lucky.Just before Christmas last year, the government screeched into a Bambi-on-ice U-turn, ditching its previously easy-going approach to festive lockdown rules, and plunging the vast swathes of the south eastright back into Tier  with its draconian ‘no mixing’ rules – which meant no mingling with anyone not from your household. For the rest of the country, some mixing was allowed on Christmas Day only, which meant long-anticipated family visits and trips all had to be scrapped with just a couple of days warning, large turkeys were chucked away and carefully chosen kids’ presents hidden until spring when visits could once again resume. But none of the practical dficulties we all suddenly faced compared to the waves of disappointment and sadness. For some, it would have been the last time they’d see their elderly parents – and even that bittersweet joy was gone.  After almost a year living under the brutal strictures of the pandemic, Christmas was a light in the darkness, suddenly extinguished, with long-awaited family togetherness reduced to a Zoom call and a ready meal for one. After a year when children couldn’t see their friends, they now couldn’t see their cousins to exchange gts and play games either, and single people, orcees, the lonely elderly and all the recently Covid-bereaved were left to stare at their TV alone. It’s a bleak picture, but reportedly one that didn’t trouble the man tasked with leading our beleaguered country through its most painful period of loss, fear and damage since World War II. At Downing Street, perhaps there was togetherness – an exchange of presents, laughter and fun. They wouldn’t have wanted their close friend to be alone at Christmas. Few, in fact, wanted that. And yet so many did it for the greater good, afraid of spreading a deadly disease for which there was not yet a vaccine. Personal sacrice was writ large in every abandoned visit and unbought gt. If it transpires that Johnson and his we didn’t do the same, by this Christmas he should, at long last, be out of a job.

The overwhelming majority of British Muslims like me detest Islamist extremism. Islamists are dferent to Muslims. The former seek to politicise Islam, stamp its superiority into state structures, and place Sharia laws within the heart of institutions. Whereas Muslims seek to practise their faith on a personal basis and within the secular framework of our society. The vast majority of British Muslims are not Islamists.  Islamists should be viewed as preying like wolves on British Muslim communities, looking for the vulnerable and the marginalised, to inculcate them with their poisonous rhetoric. Sadly, in the past two to three years there has been little work done by this Government on tackling Islamist extremism. There has been no community-focused work tackling Islamist networks online or in small but vocal sections of Muslim communities. There needs to be a rapid and hard change of tack. These networks and influencers must be disrupted.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times. The newsletter is sent out twice daily with the latest UK  world politics news, along with leading opinion and analysis.You can sign up here.  And those in Muslim communities who want to speak out against such extremism need to be actively supported. Time and time again, when brave British Muslims have spoken out against Islamism, they have been targeted and smeared by such networks. This cannot be allowed to continue. There are many British Muslims willing to stand up for our country’s values and its collective safety and security. The best message the Government can send to those who seek to harm and ide us, is there are Muslims willing to reclaim their faith from the twisted rhetoric of extremists. This is essential for race and faith relations in our country.

It comes as the brutal murder of Sir David Amess, who was stabbed while at a constituency surgery at a church in Leigh-on-Sea on Friday, sparks fresh concern over the security of MPs. The killing follows the death of Jo Cox in . Speaking to Times Radio, Sir Lindsay said: We should also know who is putting up on social media. We should know the person behind it. These fake accounts, when we donapost know who they are. Offshore accounts being used as well, for threats and intimidation.  When somebody threatened to put a bomb under my car, just recently, that was done from an offshore account. He added: Recently, Iaposve had a couple of death threats. Maybe itaposs because Iaposve got a higher profile of being the Speaker. People then they take exception and they think the answer is that thereaposs others to inspire to murder me and the threats being out there. These things happen.

If it was up to me and I was in charge of legislation, I would have done something. We are working very closely with them, some arenapost working as well as they should do and they need to get their act together, he added. Home Secretary Priti Patel did not rule out scrapping online anonymity in an interview with broadcasters on Sunday. She said: “I want us to look at everything.  “There is work taking place already. We have an Online Harms Bill that will come to Parliament, there is working taking place on it right now. “I’ve done a lot of work on social media s, mainly around encryption and areas of that nature. “But we can’t carry on like this. I spend too much time with communities who have been under attack, basically who have had all sorts of postings online and it is a struggle to get those posts taken down. “We want to make some big changes on that.” Since Sir David’s death, MPs have been sharing their day-to-day experience of the threats they face.Senior Labour MP Ms Nandy, asked whether she felt safe doing her job in her constituency, replied: “No, not reallyI’m honest.”The representative for Wigan said she backed the idea of MPs being able to ask for police protection at public meetings.  “I’m not sure that we can ever eliminate the risk but there are other things that can be done to reduce the risk,” the shadow foreign secretary told Trevor Phillips during an interview on Sky News. “I think the suggestion from the Speaker about ensuring that anyone who wants or needs security at surgeries is a good idea, not least because people often know, evenwe don’t advertise them, that they are happening, so they can become a magnet for people who want to come and cause trouble.” Andrew Rosindell, the Tory MP for Romford, said MPs were “a little bit” frightened after Friday’s tragic events and that he would recommend not publicising constituency surgeries online. Speaking to PA in Leigh-on-Sea, he said: “The problem with social media is that it can be picked up by anybody anywhere.

It need not be obtrusive, it need not be so obvious, but I think the protection has got to be made available now to Members of Parliament who feel that there is a risk to what they are doing. I think that will be introduced in the next few days.  The former Labour leader said that “the answer cannot be less democracy”. He went on: “The answer when you come across a terrorist incident is we donapost blink, we donapost shirk, we donapost flinch, we donapost show weakness and we stand up for what we believe. And, of course, we will increase the security that is available to Members of Parliament and councillors when theyaposre doing their surgeries, and that is something that must happen immediately.

Some .million people claim both Disability Living Allowanceor its replacement Personal Independence Payment- paid to help people with the costs of being disabled - and Employment and Support Allowanceor its replacement within Universal Credit . In a Green Paper published over the summer, the Department for Work and Pensionssaid: “In future, we could look to create a new single benefit. “This could both provide support for disabled people and people with health conditions on low income and with extra costs. “Alternatively, a new benefit could have dferent priorities or a dferent set of objectives to our current system. “More focus could be put on supporting people with their extra costs, or on helping people to find and stay in work.” This has raised some fears for claimants - as PIP and DLA are paid regardless of wealth, while ESA and UC depend partly on your income. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said this month she is “not aware” of any plans to cut PIP, but did not rule out merging the benefits together. She told a Tory conference event “I don’t think we’re looking at” merging non-means-tested PIP with means-tested UC, and the reform would not be “just trying to force-fit dferent benefits together”. However, she added: “Everything is on the table is I think the best way of saying it, because the Green Paper is quite broad and we want to get some focus on genuine innovative thinking. “Are these benefits actually working, that’s the question I often ask my officials. Are they having the intended desire, andnot, what are we going to do about that ”  Ms Coffey also suggested she was concerned by the number of people claiming PIP for mental health dficulties, saying she wanted to “target that even more so to people who really need that support”. She added: “PIP has certainly grown in a way that was not anticipated when it was introduced. “To give you an example, three out of four young people who claim PIP have their primary reason being mental ill health. “That in itself is , young people who currently receive benefit focused on that. There may be other benefits they receive as well. “So that’s one of the things where I’m very conscious one of things I’m trying to do as Secretary of State is very much the issues we face are downstream, and what are the things we need to do to get more upstream.” At present, dferent assessments have to be held for PIP DLA and ESA UC - and the DWP reports people find it dficult and confusing to go through the same process repeatedly. Some have told the DWP that having more than one face-to-face assessment is extremely distressing.But others are worried that under a single benefit scheme, their finances would depend on the outcome of just one appointment, as also reported by BirminghamLive.The DWPsays keeping all these dferent existing benefits and having just one assessment wouldnapost work - but a brand new scheme would be a way to make the whole system simpler. At present, those with health conditions or disabilities who arenapost working or are on a low wage can put in a claim for payments under Universal Credit. Many are still on ESA , which UC is replacing. Separately, they can also apply for PIPto meet the extra costs of their condition, regardless of their income. It is worth a maximum of £. a week. Some still get the older benefit Disability Living Allowance, which PIP is replacing. The DWP Green Paper said: People who are on PIP as well as claiming either ESA or UC with a health condition currently go through two separate application and assessment processes. This means that people sometimes feel the same information is requested twice. The dferent purposes of the separate benefits are also not always clear to people claiming them. Some people have told us that having to go through two separate processes can be confusing and dficult. People told us that there needs to be a simpler application and assessment process. Some people felt that having a single health and disability benefit would help achieve this. Other people were worried about all their financial support depending on the outcome of one assessment. introducing a single assessment into the current system would not be beneficial. The benefits have been designed separately and each assessment considers dferent criteria.” It “added: If we were to introduce a new single benefit, depending on how this was designed and its objectives, it might be possible to use a single assessment. Alternatively, we might be able to simply access to this new benefit in some other way. The report added: We will consider the impact of any potential changes to the benefits system on the other benefits and support we provide for disabled people and people with health conditions. For example, changes to PIP, UC or ESA could affect benefits such as Carer’s Allowance and Attendance Allowance. We will look holistically at any changes we make, to avoid unintended consequences. We are committed to making any changes collaboratively, working with and listening to the people who receive and rely on our benefits. Universal Credit is also available to those without medical problems and, in those cases, people donapost need an appointment with a health professional. But any income and savings are assessed every month before the DWP decides how much money will be paid into accounts. Almost six million people claim UC, with numbers doubling during the pandemic.The standard allowance forUniversal Credithas now been cut by £ a month, following the removal of a coronavirus top-up that was provided from April  to September .

The former Prime Minister piled pressure on western nations to export surplus doses, as he blasted a lack of coordination in helping other countries inoculate populations against Covid-. A report due out tomorrow suggests about  million vaccines are sitting in Europe and the US which are unlikely to be used for months, he revealed. Mr Brown said the West has got to take action immediately to use these unused vaccines to save lives”. Many of them may go to waste - and that would be criminal - which could immediately be airlted out to those countries where the level of vaccination is so low that not even the nurses and doctors are protected - and certainly not the elderly and vulnerable,” the ex-Labour leader told Sky News. Boris Johnson promised at the G that he was going to vaccinate the whole world. He made this bold announcement that, by next year, everybody would be vaccinated who was an adult in the developing world as well as the developed world. But since then, so little has happened that we now face the possibility of every target being missed.”Experts have warned that leaving developing countries with far lower rates of vaccination than richer nations risked creating the conditions for mutant coronavirus strains - which could undermine the effectiveness of jabs.Challenged about his suggestion of criminality, Mr Brown said: “I was talking about neglect. “I do think that this is a lack of co-ordination. “IfPresident Biden, Boris Johnson, Ursula von der Leyen – the president of the European Union –Justin Trudeau came together, they would find that they had these unused vaccines that are not going to be used. “Even after all the boosters, there are excess vaccines that are not going to be used and they should get them out as quickly as possible.” He also suggested that Mr Johnson had missed a meeting, hosted by Mr Biden, to discuss getting vaccines sent to developing countries and said the PM should answer to the House of Commons about what role he played in that summit. A Downing Street source has said that the Prime Minister did miss his speaking slot, but said it was because the meeting was running late and he was due to attend a wreath-laying event at Arlington Cemetery in Washington DC.

Bushra Zafar-Khan, , was devastated when her beau, who lived in Pakistan, ended their long-distance betrothal - so much so that she decided to change her le. The mum-of-one, who lives in Canary Wharf, started her weight loss journey as a new yearaposs resolution in January  after realising her weight was st lb. She said: I was heartbroken when my engagement was called off because I was really looking forward to getting married, but it wasn’t meant to be. But after making changes to her le and watching the weight fall off her, Bushra had the confidence to open herself up to love again.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Five years on, sheaposs now married to her husband Fahad, , and they share three-year-old son, Salman. She said: “I thank my lucky stars that everything in le led me to where I am now - six stone lighter with a loving husband and a perfect little boy.” Bushra was introduced to her long-distance fiancé in  when she went to visit relatives in Pakistan. “I couldn’t wait to be married, so when he called off the engagement in December , I was devastated,” she said. She was  at the time and worried the clock was ticking for her.  Bushra added: I have polycystic oies, so I already thought it was probably too late for me to have children. I found the whole experience so depressing and, while deep down I knew the engagement hadn’t been called off because of my weight, I couldn’t help but feel low over it. I knew I wanted to make a change. A size  at the time, Bushra decided to search for weight loss support groups online and found advice from other women on how to sht the pounds. She said: It wasn’t necessarily how much I was eating, because I probably eat more now since the weight loss, but it was the type of foods I was eating. I was just having all the wrong things, like pizza, and at the wrong times. Although not hugely overweight, Bushra said her size was affecting how she felt about herself and spilled into her everyday le. She said: Even though I love sports, I couldnapost run as much because of my weight and lack of energy. Sometimes, when you’re bigger, you feel like certain things, such as failed relationships, are down to your weight. Even though it’s probably not that, it definitely knocks your confidence. In January , she discovered the DA Group after it was recommended by a friend. Bushra said: The DA Group offer dferent weight plans that you can follow, where they advise how much protein and vegetables to have in one sitting.  I started taking an energy supplement in the morning and following their suggestions at mealtimes. It’s quite flexible though, so I was still able to have a little treat in the day and, because you can have treats, there was nothing I was missing out on. They allow cheat days too which helped me with cravings. Within a month of following the new plan, Bushra said she lost more than a stone and dropped two dress sizes. A year later, she lost a whopping six stone, weighing in at st lb. It was incredible, I was wearing a size  which I never thought I would be. I felt so much more confident within myself. And with a new glow from the confidence sheaposd gained, Bushra even found love.  She said: I worked with Fahad at the university. I think he might have always fancied me but when we met, he knew I was engaged, so never pursued it. A few months after my engagement was called off, Fahad asked me out and I agreed to go for a coffee with him. I knew pretty early on that he was the one. The couple got engaged in July  and tied the knot just three months later. Bushra said: Everything happened really fast, even my pregnancy. I fell pregnant just two weeks after getting married. In July , Bushra welcomed little Salman into the world. All this time I was worried about my fertility, but I fell pregnant so quickly and naturally, she said. I think my weight loss played a role in that, but I also think it was just meant to be. Now Bushra is happier than ever with her new le - although she admits sheaposs still getting used to her figure. She said: It’s hard to believe sometimes that I’ve managed to lose so much weight and keep it off. I didn’t notice much of dference at first but people around me definitely did. It wasn’t until I started comparing photos that I realised how much weight I had lost. She now enjoys wearing stylish clothes, rather than hiding behind baggier fits. She notices the biggest change in herself when she goes on holiday and wears proper swimsuits.Have you had a body transformation  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcI look younger now that I did when I was in my s, she said.

It was just the latest in a long line of stunts that has seen Banksy sneakily hang his works in the Tate and Louvre, and erect an inflatable Guantanamo Bay doll in Disneyland. Since rising to fame in the late s and early Noughties, the artistaposs witty, satirical murals and daring pranks have earned him millions of pounds. But what is his total fortune - and who is the man behind the mask  What is Banksyaposs net worth  Banksy began his career in the early s as part of the growing Bristol underground street art scene alongside artists like Nick Walker and Inkie. While his trademark stencil graffiti initially only popped up around the city, it later appeared in other locations like London and Brighton. Get the biggest news delivered to your inbox.for the Mirroraposs free newslettersIn , he put on his first gallery exhibition in Los Angeles, and since then his pieces have skyrocketed in popularity and value.His net worth is said to be million , according to Celebrity Net Worth - though he prefers any proceeds from sales to go to charity.Instead, Banksyaposs income is said to come from sales of books and films about his work. In , he published a best-selling tome, Wall and Piece, while he also directed a documentary called Exit Through The Gt Shop. The film - about a young artist who goes looking for Banksy - was even nominated for an Oscar and raked in £million.  Despite his success, however, the aposguerrillaapos artist has always preferred being a counter-culture hero. Graffiti art has a hard enough le as it is, before you add hedge-fund managers wanting to chop it out and hang it over the fireplace, he told Village Voice. For the sake of keeping all street art where it belongs, I’d encourage people not to buy anything by anybody, unless it was created for sale in the first place. Prime suspects - from music legend to Art Attack star Over the years, Banksyaposs true identity has been a source of frenzied speculation - and some of it is truly bizarre. Fans of the hit s TV series Art Attack may recall that last year former host Neil Buchanan was forced to deny he was the masked menace.  After a rumour circulated that Banksy artwork had appeared in locations close to where the -year-oldaposs former band Marseille had played gigs, his website issued a statement shutting down the theories. Neil Buchanan ISNaposT Banksy, it read. We have been inundated with enquiries over the weekend regarding the current social media story. Unfortunately this website does not have the infrastructure to answer all these enquiries inidually, however we can confirm that there is no truth in the rumour whatsoever. One of the more persistent rumours links Banksy with Massive Attack musician Robert Del Naja, also known as D. Before his rise with the iconic Bristol trip hop band, Del Naja was considered to be the cityaposs first graffiti artist and a pioneer of the stencil art movement. In what could be a cunning double bluff, heaposs been praised by Banksy as an early influence and the pair are said to be friends. However, fans were left convinced they could be one and the same after singer Goldie aposlet slipapos Robaposs name while mentioning Banksy in a  podcast interview. He said: Give me a bubble letter and put it on a T-shirt and write aposBanksyapos on it and weaposre sorted, we can sell it now. No disrespect to Rob, I think heaposs a brilliant artist. I think he has flipped the world of art over. One theory put forward by Scottish journalist Craig Williams is that Banksy could in fact be a collective of artists - although he suggested it could be headed up by Del Naja. He wrote: A multi disciplined artist in front of one of the seminal groups in recent British history, doubling up as the planetaposs most revered street artist. Now that would be cool.  The most popular theory, however, is that Banksy is the lesser known artist Robin Gunningham. In , a photograph emerged of a man in Jamaica with a spray can at his feet that was said to show the artist at work. A Mail On Sunday article claimed to have identied the man as former public schoolboy Gunningham after talking to his childhood pals in Bristol. The theory took off further in  when Banksyaposs lawyers tried to delay the publication of a report by researchers from Queen Mary University which used aposgeographic profilingapos to unmask him. The technique - often used to catch serial criminals - analysed the locations of  artworks to seethere were any common links with the main apossuspectsapos.“I’d be surprisedit’s not [Gunningham]” Steve Le Comber, a biologist and co-author of the study, told the BBC. “It rapidly became apparent that there is only one serious suspect, and everyone knows who it is. Mysterious apossightingsapos of legendary artist While heaposs impressively avoided the limelight for decades, a few apossightingsapos of Banksy have been reported over the years. In , a man in a hi-vis jacket was snapped spraying the White Horse pub in Liverpool.  Taken years after the painting had been confirmed as authentic, itaposs believed to be the first picture of the artist at work - but his face is frustratingly hard to make out. Then in , a graffiti artist in Australia was caught on video spraying a wall in Melbourne, Australia - signing it off as Banksy. The woman behind the camera chases down the man as he hurries away, causing him to turn around and yell f*** off before fleeing. However, the artwork didnapost quite look Banksyaposs usual style - and his team later insisted it was a fake. Shortly afterwards, footage emerged of a man spraying an underpass in Briston for a Sunday Times Magazine piece on the artist. The shaky footage shows an artists arriving on a bike to paint the wall before taking off, though itaposs thought he could also be a member of the iconaposs team.  Earlier this summer, Banksy filmed himself in the act, taking to Instagram to claim credit for new spectacular street murals which had been discovered in Suffolk and Norfolk.The mystery artist uploaded a video of himself getting down to work at locations after driving a campervan packed full of spray paint. He called the clip A Great British Spraycation - and of course, didnapost show his face.Got a story  Get in touch by emailing alex.bellotti@reachplc Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BanksySothebysArt\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ex-school friends of the alleged killer of MP Sir David Amess, who was stabbed to death during a surgery meeting on Friday afternoon, claimed he became obsessed with Choudary and watched videos of him. British Islamist Choudary was jailed for five years and six months following a trial at the Old Bailey in  after being deemed to have invited support of ISIS. Convicted under section  of the Terrorism Act , Choudary was told by Mr Justice Holroyde he had crossed the line between the legitimate expression of your own views and a criminal act. After his release in  he was banned from public speaking, though this was lted in July. Ali allegedly booked an appointment to see the Sir David at Belfairs Methodist Church in Essex a week before the fatal attack, security sources have said. A pinned tweet to the father-of-fiveaposs public account invited people to book an appointment to see their MP at the church hall on Friday. A friend told The Sun : “Choudary was someone he became utterly obsessed with.Another ex-school pal said Ali was once a popular school boy who enjoyed football and socialising. They added: He had been a really lovely lad. A devoted ­Muslim and very popular. He enjoyed football and was very normal and we’d all go to the cinema. “He’d socialise and everyone really liked him.”  Police said on Friday they were treating Sir Davidaposs death as terror-related, with a potential link to Islamist extremism. The Met Police said on Saturday night they will now be able to keep the suspect in custody till October  under section  of the Terrorism Act . Ali, who is currently being held at a London police station, is a British national with Somali heritage.  He is understood not to have been known as a subject of interest to security service MI ahead of the attack. A tribute from the Amess family today said: The family would like to thank everyone for the wonderful, wonderful tributes paid to David following his cruel and violent death. It truly has brought us so much comfort. The support shown by friends, constituents and the general public alike has been so overwhelming.  As a family it has given us strength. We have realised from tributes paid that there was far, far more to David than even we, those closest to him, knew. We are enormously proud of him. Our hearts are shattered. However, there was still so much David wanted to do – this we know from the events of the last few days. So, this is not the end of Sir David Amess MP. It is the next chapter and as a family we ask everyone to support the many charities he worked with. There are so many to mention, so find one close to your hearts and help.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON politan PoliceMIDavid AmessEducationSchoolsTerrorismAnjem Choudary\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Harry’s daughter Ann Hudson, , immediately called for an ambulance at .pm. She said: “We rushed down to his house, me and my brother, and he was lying on the floor.  “We managed to get him up and into a chair, but he was in a lot of pain, so I rang  as you do, because I thought I can’t move him, not really, because he was in too much pain to be moved. “When I rang  they said it could be a while, so I rang back a number of times, at least twice to get an update. “A clinician did ring and went through a number of questions but it was seven hours before they actually turned up to pick him up, and it turns out he’d broken his thigh bone.” Despite the agonising seven-hour wait for an ambulance, his daughter said that Mr Soar blames government cuts to health services rather than the NHS or East Midlands Ambulance Service. Further delaying treatment was the fact that Mr Soar had to be taken to Queenaposs Medical Centre, in Nottingham, as the Royal Derby Hospital did not have the capacity to treat him, added his daughter Ann. Due to the non-le-threatening nature of Harry’s fall, his request for an ambulance was logged as a category  call - one which is potentially serious and requires possible pain control and treatment. But category  calls are not immediately le-threatening and therefore are not a priority to the ambulance service. Nationally, the ambulance service aims to respond to these calls within an average time of  minutes, and nine times out of ten within two hours. Instead, Mr Soar had to wait in his home in pain for seven hours. His daughter continued: “They said it could be up to six hours, but we were hoping for less than that. “When it came to six hours time and they hadn’t turned up, I rang them back and they said it could be six or more hours. “They weren’t friendly on the phone I would say, they were just very busy. “I just don’t think it’s right, especially with an -year-old being left that long in pain. “On the day I was very angry because obviously your parents are your responsibility basically, and you’ve got to look after them when they get older.” Mr Soar was eventually seen by the ambulance crew and taken to Nottingham’s Queen’s Medical Centre, after being told that Royal Derby hospital was closed to emergencies because they were too busy. Despite their long wait, Harry and his family understand that the delay was a result of high demand for NHS services. Ann said: Despite waiting seven hours for an ambulance, he doesnapost blame them, he blames the government cuts for the delay. After breaking his thigh bone during the fall, Mr Soar has since had an operation to help his mobility. Craig Whyles, service delivery manager for Derbyshire at East Midlands Ambulance Service, said: “We are very sorry to hear that we were unable to get to Mr Soar sooner on this occasion and I recognise the distress that this will have caused to him and his family. “Every  call is assessed based on the information provided by the caller and people experiencing a le-threatening emergency such as cardiac arrest or breathing dficulties have to be seen first. “Using the information shared during the initial call, this incident was categorised as not immediately le-threatening. “At the time there was a high demand on EMAS and the wider NHS system, and we were responding to a number of people whose le was reported to be at immediate risk. “We are currently in contact with Mr Soar and his family through our Patient Advice and Liaison Service and will fully investigate the reason for this delay.” Comment MORE ON NHSHospitals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Demi Benbowaposs American bulldog Buster escaped from her property in Stoke-on-Trent and attacked another dog being walked by its owner on March . As the owner tried to separate the animals, he was badly bitten.The attack left the man in hospital for six days and he had surgery on both hands, StokeonTrentLive reports. Ms Benbow’s dog Buster has since been put down, magistrates at North Staffordshire Justice Centre heard. Prosecutor Karen Wright said: It was pm and the victim left his address to walk his -year-old Siberian husky, Ice, on a lead. He walked past the defendantaposs address on Catharine Road and noticed the bulldog Buster in the garden. That dog left the property through an insecure gate and attacked his dog. The victim tried to stop the dog from hurting his dog by using his free hand to try to part them.  He was bitten to the thumb. It was a quite nasty injury. He let go of his own dogaposs lead and tried to punch the bulldog to the face. He was shouting and screaming. Neighbours heard the commotion and came outside. The bulldog was put back inside the owneraposs property. Miss Benbow came out and tried to help. She administered first aid to the injured party.” The court heard tensions were high and Ms Benbow made a  call to report what had happened. Of the victim, the prosector said: “He had to have his thumb reattached and has been told it may have to be removed. On his other hand, he has had four surgeries to reattach the tendons on his palm. Ms Benbow pleaded guilty to being the owner of a dog dangerously out of control causing injury. She was fined £ and ordered to pay an additional £ in court costs and charges. David Houldcroft, mitigating, said Ms Benbowaposs young son had left the front door and gate open, leading to the dogaposs escape. He said: She hasnapost really done a great deal wrong. The only thing you can criticise her for is allowing her son to open the door and gate, but it is dficult to keep your eye on children all the time, as many of us know. They acquired the dog as a family pet during the first lockdown. The dog had never attacked anyone before. It was not, on the face of it, an aggressive dog, it was scared of other dogs.

Wayne Haskett, from Cannock, houses his collection of medieval items which he has accumulated over the past  years in his realistic medieval-themed man cave in his garden. His obsession with medieval times started when he was a child and has grown over the years. Wayne even had a medieval and Game of Thrones themed wedding when he married his we, Claire, last year, for which he wore full knights outfits. Wayne says that when people walk into his man cave, which cost £, to complete, their jaws drop to the ground and they say it is like going back in time. The decision to build the themed shed began in lockdown last year, he said. He had around  items of medieval memorabilia that he had spent the past  years collecting, which had previously been displayed around the house.  My we, Claire, , also has an interest in the medieval times but she wasnapost so keen on all the stuff being around the house as she feels like itaposs her domain, ” Wayne said. So when I mentioned the idea of the themed man cave, she was very supportive because it meant all of the items would get moved out of the house and be used to decorate the Yawning Portal.” He predominantly built the structure himself, he said, with a bit of help from friends and family along the way. In total, it took around five months and cost around £k to complete. It has a fireplace with an original cast iron fire backplate to add to the middle ages theme, a make-believe well and an eight-seater table,” he said. And the walls are just plastered with my collections such as my French medieval tapestry, ornamental swords, old books and tankards to give it the medieval fantasy look I want.  Just outside the front of it, I have also created a Viking set up with a themed table and chairs where we like to have BBQs.” Itaposs all very realistic,” he added. Wayne’s love for medieval times has been growing since he was a child. He loved history lessons at school and playing games such as dungeons and dragons with his friends. In his twenties, he then started to collect historical items that were related to the middle ages and even went on to have a medieval-themed wedding. After meeting his we seven years ago, Wayne says that Claire had a little interest in medieval times which grew thanks to him and his passion.  The care worker said his Game of Thrones themed wedding last year had been “fantastic”, and insisted Claire had loved it as much as he did. I had all my ushers in full medieval attire and I was dressed as a knight. I was walking around in chain mail all day which was very heavy,” he said. Claireaposs dress also matched the theme. It was so good and everything looked great.” Wayne said his passion for medieval times had got him into “so many” enjoyable hobbies, including longbow shooting, Comicon events and martial arts.  Iaposm really happy with the medieval man cave that I created as it pays homage to medieval fantasy and Game of Thrones,” he said. I have collected all my pieces from ious places, such as antique fairs, emporiums and by searching online.” Having a place to go, to admire all of his items was great, Wayne said. “I like going down at night time with the fire flickering because I can really relax and take it all in.

YouTuber, Max Stanford, , from London, took on the plant-based powerhouse challenge in his latest upload for his channel, Max Vs Food. The burger is a new trial release product from McDonaldaposs which contains an entirely plant-based patty, with vegan cheese and a vegan sandwich sauce. Max challenged himself to wolf down , calories in the form of  burgers but only managed a respectable . He said, There has been a lot of talk about this new burger, and I always like to try new food items. Iaposm also keen on keeping myself updated with all the latest vegan products, to see what they are like compared to their non vegan equivalents.  It was something I knew I wanted to try for a food challenge. Max said he knew his  goal would be a stretch, and that burger number  snapped him back to the reality of how dficult the challenge was. He said, I was just trying to see how many I would be able to eat, and I knew I knew a target of  was ambitious but itaposs one to aim for. It was around the time I reached the th burger that I really started to feel the impact of the challenge.  The last  were a struggle so I was happy with my time of  minutes and  seconds, but I wish I could have finished the last ones a lot sooner. After I finished, I just went into a food coma, I was asleep before I knew it! Max described the taste of the burger as meaty, but not like a traditional beef burger. He explained, You could tell it was dferent to a regular beef patty, but it didnapost taste like the pea-based protein which itaposs made from. There was quite a bit of iation per burger, so some had lots of sauce which I wasnapost such a fan of as I liked the natural taste of the patty. The cheese and sauce tasted exactly the same to me in the burger and the bun was very similar too, but overall it was decent, and I think itaposs good for people to expand their horizons when it comes to food.  When people say they donapost like something without having tried it, I think thataposs just silly, give it a try and thenyou donapost like it then thataposs fair. Max resisted the urge to wash the burgers down with a traditional McDonaldaposs milkshake, and instead opted for some lighter soft drinks. He said, I did have some cola, ginger beer and a store-bought milkshake just to help me through the process. It sounds crazy but I actually put some whipped spray cream on the last burger to provide some sweetness as the flavour fatigue was so tough for the last ones. Maxaposs usual go to McDonaldaposs order is more traditional, and he has dabbled in McDonaldaposs challenges and other vegan challenges before as well.  He said, Nuggets or chicken selects are my go-to and Iaposve taken on a -nugget challenge before and won a contest where I ate  in  minutes to win £. I recently was part of a speed eating challenge where I had to finish a Papa Johnaposs jackfruit and vegan cheese pizza as one of the choices and it wasnapost good at all. But I had a vegan burger contest where I ate  in  minutes, and it was the Moving Mountains brand, beetroot-based patties which were really tasty.You can find Max on his Instagram page @maxvsfood_ Comment MORE ON Papa JohnYouTubeMcDonalds CorporationWorld recordsVegan\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But when it comes to choosing baby names in the UK, it seems many parents tend to think alike - with several favourite names seeming to top the charts every year. Names like Amelia and Isla often top the list of girlsapos names, with Jack and James always being firm favourites for newborn boys.  And the top choice for both girls and boys remains unchanged this year - with Olivia and Oliver taking first preference among parents in England and Wales for the eighth year in a row. However, it seems these names tend to be most popular with older parents, as the data also showed that younger parents favoured shorter names like Leo and Theo for boys and Ava and Ivy for girls.  For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Data from the Office for National Statistics shows that, for both boysapos and girlsapos names, the top  was slightly changed. Whereas Grace and Freya made the shortlist the previous year,  data shows those favourites had been replaced by Ivy and Rosie.And Charlie was knocked out of the top  for boysapos names for the first time since  - being replaced by Archie, which could have been influenced by Prince Harry and Meghan Markleaposs son. Whataposs your favourite baby name  Have your say in the comment section below. Statistics from the last  years show boysapos names Arthur and Noah have soared up the ranks in popularity to rank in the top five in . The two biggest climbers for boysapos names in  were Milo and Otis, which went up by about  places. According to the ONS, parents over the age of  were more likely to choose traditional names while younger parents tended to choose modern, shortened names. Sian Bradford from the ONS said: Oliver and Olivia held on to the top spots as the most popular boysapos and girlsapos names in  but some interesting changes took place beneath them. We continue to see the age of mothers having an impact on the choice of baby name. Archie jumped into the top  boysapos names for the first time, driven by younger mothers as well as the obvious royal link, while on the girlsapos side, Ivy rose to sixth place. Popular culture continues to provide inspiration for baby names, whether itaposs characters in our favourite show or trending celebrities. Maeve and Otis, characters from the popular programme Sex Education, have seen a surge in popularity in , while the name Margot has been rapidly climbing since actress Margot Robbie appeared in the popular film The Wolf Of Wall Street.

Shocking photos show how Emily Priceaposs face ballooned and her her forehead aposcurled overapos into her eyes after applying the popular beauty treatment. Emily, , from Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, said she was left with red and crusty-looking brows after a trip to the salon on September . The mum-of-one thought she wouldnapost need a patch test as she previously used the product routinely - though hadnapost since the pandemic outbreak. She was initially happy with the results, but claims her eyebrows started to tingle an hour after having them done and it felt like a aposhot pokerapos on her skin. But when Emily awoke unable to open her eyes properly she became concerned. She was horried when her startled husband leapt out of bed clutching a mirror so she could see her swollen, weeping face. Emily rang her GPaposs surgery but was forced to simply describe her symptoms over the phone as she couldnapost get a face-to-face appointment due to Covid. With her face continuing to balloon over the coming days, Emily went to AE where stunned staff prescribed her with powerful antibiotics to tackle the infection. Emily fears her new allergic reaction could be a result of having had the Covid vaccine, after reading about links made between people having had Covid or having the vaccine and experiencing new allergies, however there is nothing to prove that. And Emily, who is double-jabbed with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, still remains a staunch advocate of getting the vaccine.  Emily, whoaposs never experienced allergic reactions in the past, watched in horror as her scabby eyebrows dropped off in patches - forcing her to colour them in with an eyebrow pencil. Now healed, writer Emily is now speaking out about her ordeal to ensure no-one goes through what she has and is urging people to always carry out patch tests, eventhey have previously not had an allergy.Whether youaposre an actual mummy or just the sort made of bandages, Halloween will be a big deal in your house.

I thought maybe she left a little bit on so I gave my face a wash thinking it would get rid of any excess.  As the hours went on it started to feel like when you burn yourself on a hot pan and you pull your hand away quickly. It was like that but it was asI couldnapost pull away from it, it was just burning hot like there was a poker across my eyebrows. I went to sleep and when I woke up there was a moment of panic as I couldnapost open my eyes properly, they were just slits. My husband was next to me, he turned the light on and looked at me and he was like aposoh my god whataposs happened to your face apos.  He ran and got a mirror, I could barely even see myself because my eyes were so swollen and I noticed that close, underneath the eyebrows, it had gone yellow. Days later I ended up going into hospital because it got worse. I looked like Sloth from The Goonies. An hour after having the beauty treatment Emily started to experience a tingling sensation and the following day she woke up to discover her face had ballooned. Worried at how it would develop, Emily managed to get a GP appointment over the phone on September th and was prescribed face wash, antihistamines and a steroid cream. But the medications did not help, and Emily took herself to Prince Charles Hospitalaposs AE department in Merthyr Tydfil on September  and was seen quickly by a skin specialist who started her on a strong course of antibiotics. She took a week-long course of antibiotics that cleared her skin but was horried when patches of eyebrow hair dropped out. Emily is sharing her experience to urge people to always get patch tested - claiming that although itaposs a apospainapos itaposs not worth being left aposlooking like a car crashapos. A Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyspokesman said they investigate all reports of adverse effects from the vaccine. They added there is no current evidence to support Emilyaposs claim of the vaccine being responsible for her reaction.The agency recommends anyone experience adverse side effects from the vaccine to report it through he MHRA Yellow Card Scheme.Comment MORE ON AllergiesSkincareICELAND HALLOWEEN NEWSJACKING\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The mum has been diagnosed with it again now, but said the jab has made all the dferenceMum Anouska Black said every breath felt like glass when she first got Covid but that changed when she was jabbed Image: Anouska BlackByApril Curtin:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsA mum whose lung nearly collapsed when she was first struck by Covid- said the jab made all the dference when she contracted it a second time. Anouska Black, , from Co Down, Northern Ireland, said her body has been through trauma after she was originally diagnosed with the virus back in September . She said she completely randomly had an asthma attack and before she knew it she woke up in hospital with a lung that had nearly collapsed.The mum and step mum, from Magheralin, told Belfast Live : Thataposs actually how I found out I got Covid.The NI pageant queen was in and out of hospital for days before receiving a phone call to give her the dreaded news – she had the virus. She said: It kind of attacked my brain and my digestive system.  Anouska had no cough, temperature or loss of taste or smell. Instead, she suffered severe migraines, vomiting and diarrhoea – while sleeping around  hours each day. Three months after being diagnosed, the -year-old was still not getting better, and said every breath felt like glass. By December, she was back in hospital. Anouska said: Living it all again that second time, knowing youaposve got Covid, there was no messing about, it was really scary. I think my mum still has PTSD from it. Her anxiety went through the roof. The mum was put on tablets and given a full treatment plan. She has since gained multiple allergies, and in April, she was diagnosed with long Covid and post-Covid anxiety.  Speaking about her anxiety, she said: I thought I was fine but the doctor actually said my body basically is showing signs of anxiety. My whole breathing pattern has changed. You can see my body has been through trauma. Now, a year after catching Covid, Anouska has just tested positive again, despite being double jabbed since catching it the first time. I couldnapost believe it to be honest, she said.Can you catch Covid- twice It is possible to catch Covid twice, though it is unlikely. It’s not yet known how long Covid- vaccine protection lasts. Studies have shown that, for most people, catching the virus means you should be protected from getting it again for at least five months. But this depends on each inidual, and while it is unlikely, people have been known to catch Covid twice in a short space of time. Data indicates fully vaccinated people are much less likely to catch Covid- twice than those who are not. Earlier in October, Anouska broke out in an almighty red rash and said her teeth were chattering. She thought she was having an allergic reaction but has since been told could have been a symptom Covid and has tested positive.Her partner also has coronavirus and they have both also been diagnosed with mild pneumonia.Sharing a warning about Covid, Anouska said: When you canapost breathe, it is literally the scariest thing in the entire world. Itaposs like drowning with air. Do not hang about with this -you feel sick ring , ring your GP. Speaking about the vaccine, she said: I really believe it has saved me from going into hospital again. It hit me so hard last year. I was in hospital, I could have died. Thereaposs such a dference between the first time and the second time. And the only dference is, Iaposve had the vaccine. I would not have liked to have taken a chance the second time. She wanted to alert people to other symptoms of Covid, and said: Itaposs not just those three [symptoms]. Thereaposs no harm in staying up-to-date with the news. Anouska wants to encourage others to give people personal space and consider doing big shops again instead of taking unnecessary risks. She said: People have become so complacent. Le has to get back to normal, but just respect each other.

The eldest Cambridge kid stood at the front looking over the thousands of people gathered below - and dad Wills crouched down to speak to him. However, granny clearly wasnapost impressed that the crowds would have been unable to see him, and appeared to berate her grandson by saying stand up William. Of course, the prince did as he was told and rose immediately, looking rather sheepish. Kate Middletonaposs epic eye roll  Kate has hardly put a foot wrong since joining the royal family after marrying Prince William in .In , while five months pregnant with Princess Charlotte, the couple travelled to New York, where Kate paid a visit to a childrenaposs centre to help them wrap Christmas presents.But after she stopped wrapping to chat to some of the volunteers, she was firmly told to keep wrapping.And in a rare candid moment, she light-heartedly rolled her eyes and did as she was told.Kate is said to have enjoyed the rest of her visit as she chatted happily with those at the centre.Princess Charlotteaposs meltdown  At only six years old, Princess Charlotte is probably just starting to learn how to navigate royal le.And in , when she was just two, she proved she was like any other toddler when she had a mini tantrum on the tarmac at Hamburg Airport.She had been visiting Germany and Poland with her parents and older brother Prince George when she and George had been given books as a gt.Her dad William took the book from her as they went to board a plane, but Charlotte clearly wasnapost ready to give it up and made her feelings clear.Cue some foot-stomping and collapsing to the floor in tears before mum Kate scooped her up in her arms - quickly avoiding a full-blown meltdown.Vexed Prince Harry  Itaposs known that Prince Harry is very protective of his we Meghan Markle and their children.So when a cameraman started getting too close to a pregnant Meghan on a visit to Morocco in  - he let his feelings be known.Harry was stood next to Meghan when he spotted the cameraman appearing to hit a child on the head with his equipment as he tried to get closer to the royal couple. The Duke quickly walked around the back of his we, presumably to not interrupt his host, before putting his hands on the lens and moving the man filming for Moroccan TV to one side. Prince Harry had a stern look on his face and instantly the cameraman backed off. The prince then put his hand on the girlaposs arm, askingshe was ok, before ing to listen to his host. Prince Georgeaposs tantrum  When a two-year-old Prince George visited the Royal International Air Tattoo at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire in , he looked overjoyed.He jumped around as he enjoyed the sights and sounds of the aircraft, looked pleased as he was handed a sticker that mum Kate attached to his top and even got to sit in a helicopter.But at one point, it seems the fun got a bit too much for young George and he had to be picked up and comforted by his mum.Maybe it was the noise of the planes that gave him a shock Kateaposs scowl at WilliamAt most public appearances, Kate usually gives nothing away with her facial expressions. But in  she appeared to scowl at husband William while attending a garden party during a tour of Poland.Her demeanour seemed drastically dferent to her beaming smiles and jovial chats to crowds outside Polandaposs Presidential Palace just hours before.Itaposs unclear why she looked gloomy, but according to OK!, George and Charlotte were accompanying their parents on the visit, so maybe tiredness of carrying out a royal tour and looking after two young kids was to blame.Comment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgeRoyal FamilyQueenPrince William\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

So rather than seeing  types of pasta you might see ten. “Or they might decide they don’t need nearly as much bottled water which is bulky and large in the shop. “It’s a tough and evolving situation and hard to say what will happen right now.  It comes after transport secretary Grant Shapps said the Government would relax cabotage rules on the number of deliveries EU drivers can make to an unlimited amount over a -day period. Ministers announced earlier this month that overseas drivers can take up six-month visas and plan to have the two-week unlimited deliveries scheme in place for December. Just  foreign drivers have so far been issued, the Government has said, as gaps remain in supermarkets and containers are left waiting at ports due to the staffing crisis.  But Rod McKenzie, managing director of policy and public affairs at the Road Haulage Association, accused the Government of pulling the lever marked ‘uncontrolled immigration’ as he claimed the scheme will lead to EU drivers undercutting UK workers. “The Government clearly wants to save Christmas and be seen to be saving Christmas, and extra drivers will clearly help Christmas deliveries, so, from a simple, populist point of view, you can see what they’re doing,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme. “But there are consequences for hardworking UK hauliers who are suffering under a weight of staff shortages, poor roadside facilities, ridiculous waiting times to load and unload, and this simply doesn’t help UK haulage.  “We don’t want cabotage to sabotage our industry.” He added RHA members were appalled at the emergency scheme, adding that ridiculous, pathetic, gobsmacked had been some of their more broadcastable comments. He said: “The Government has been talking about a high-wage, high-skill economy and not pulling the lever marked ‘uncontrolled immigration’, and to them this is exactly what it looks like. “Allowing overseas companies and drivers to come over for perhaps up to six months on a fortnightly basis to do unlimited work at low rates, undercutting UK hauliers. “So this is about taking work from British operators and drivers and giving it to Europeans who don’t pay tax here and pay peanuts to their drivers.” A Government source hit back at the intervention by the RHA, telling the Mirror: Itaposs a bit rich coming from the RHA which has consistently lobbied for theof cheap European drivers.

Overall . million Brits have recorded a confirmed Covid test but waning immunity from this and vaccines is contributing to rising cases. The UK is recording some of the highest rates of confirmed cases, hospitalisations and deaths in Western Europe after opening up more than others. Some , Brits have now been infected per million of the population compared to an EU average of ,. Spain has , per million, France has , and Germany has ,. Because of the UK’s rapid vaccine rollout many more Brits have now had their second doses at least five months ago. Some % of UK adults passed that point compared to around % in Italy and France. Slow vaccine take-up among younger age groups has also seen Britain fall down international league tables for the overall percentage of the population vaccinated.  Prof Adam Finn, member of the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation , “The really important vaccine doses that we need to give both nationally and internationally are the people who are not yet been immunized. That’s our priority. “Finding a way to immunise such people, including those who are hesitant to receive the new vaccine s for one reason or another, is a very viable and important priority.” Prof Finn, of Bristol University, was presenting trial results of the latest Covid- vaccine by Valneva shown to work. He added: “We’re all drting into a position where we are kind of beginning to talk like the pandemic is done and dusted. That way of thinking is premature.”  Around one in four adults who received their second vaccine dose at least five months ago have still not had a booster jab. The JCVI recommended Brits get third doses at least six months after the first. Around % of UK adults who received their second dose at least six months ago have not had a booster shot. King’s College London’s COVID Symptom Study concluded in August that the effectiveness of the AstraZeneca jab fell from % to % at four to five months after a second dose. The drop off for the Pfizer jab was slightly less at % to %. Israel was one of the few countries ahead of the UK in the initial vaccine rollout and has seen a huge surge in infections in recent months as vaccine protection wanes. The Our World Data comparison project by the John Hopkins University in the US shows Israel also has a high rate of people who have been infected with the virus. Its rate is higher than the UK’s at , per million of the population. The number of UK daily deaths within  days of a positive Covid test dropped to between  and  over the summer.  The latest UK seven-day average for Covid deaths has  people dying each day. Prof Linda Bauld, of University of Edinburgh, told the : “We’re in a phase where we still have large numbers of people dying from this disease. “But it has gone into the background. We’ve become used to something that has not gone away. I think there’s been a desensitisation to the mortality.” Prof Robert West, a behavioural scientist at University College London, said: “There’s some who are of the view that Covid is becoming endemic, it was always going to become endemic and we just need to get on with it. “Then we’ve got another group of scientists saying ‘Look around the world at other countries that won’t tolerate such high rates of infection’”Downing Street acknowledged that winter would be challenging when questioned about rising coronavirus rates.The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: We obviously keep very close watch on the latest statistics.Montenegro - ,. Andorra - ,. Georgia - , San Marino - ,. Czech Republic - ,. Serbia - ,. Slovenia - ,. Lithuania - ,. Cyprus - ,. Estonia - ,. *UK - ,. Netherlands - ,. Sweden - ,. Belgium - ,. Spain - ,. France - ,. Portugal - ,. *EU - ,. We always knew the coming months would be challenging. What we are seeing is case rates, hospitalisations and deaths still broadly in line with the modelling as set out a few months back now. The vaccination programme will continue to be our first line of defence, along with new treatments, testing and public health advice. But we will obviously keep a close watch on cases. But it is thanks to our vaccination programme that we are able to substantially break the link between cases, hospitalisations and deaths.

Donapost f*****g smile. The woman can be seen smiling, but it is not clear what she says in response. He can then be heard shouting at her again saying: Donapost taunt me or Iaposll knock you the f**k out you c***. The woman does not back down at his threats and refuses to cower, saying: If you call me a c*** Iaposll call you a c***. The man then walks towards the woman at speed and squares up to her, forcing her to back into the door of the carriage and press into the plastic ider. At this point a number of men who have been watching the incident unfold leap to their feet to pull him away from the woman and force him to leave the carriage. A British Transport Police spokesperson said: We are aware of this video that is being circulated on social media and our officers are looking into it further. Weaposre asking anyone with further details to text us on  with the reference  of   .

Latest figures show the UK is recording more than five times more cases per million people than Germany, and a whopping  times more than Spain.It comes after the Department of Health announced the largest daily rise in coronavirus cases since July  yesterday, with more than , people testing positive in  hours.It has sparked calls for the government to bring in its aposPlan Bapos in England - bringing back compulsory mask wearing indoors, encouraging working from home and introducing controversial vaccine passports.Research by Our World In Data found that in the seven days to Friday, the UK had a rate of . infections per million of the population. This compares to . in Germany, . in Spain, . in Italy and just . in Spain, where stricter coronavirus measures are in place.The UK is also recording more than three times more deaths per million people than Spain, Italy and France, researchers found.  Martin McKee, professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the Financial Times that England should immediately be activating” stronger measures.He said: “These small measures like mask-wearing, distancing, ventilation and an emphasis on homeworking are greater than the sum of their parts. “It really doesn’t take an awful lot to bring this down, as France, Italy and others have shown.” Latest Department of Health figures show the number of people testing positive for the virus has risen by more than  per cent in a week. Yesterday , cases were confirmed, bringing the seven day total to ,. Experts have warned that health services could once again be overwhelmed over the winter. In the past seven days there have been  Covid deaths across the UK, an . per cent week-on-week increase. Our World in Data found that the UK has a rate of . deaths per million people, compared to . in Ireland, . in Germany, . in Spain, . in Italy and . in France. More than , people are in hospital with Covid-, of which  were in ventilator beds, the government said yesterday. There were , admissions with the virus in seven days.Earlier today The Mirror reported that experts had warned the Covid booster programme may be moving too slowly to prevent hospitals from becoming overcrowded this winter. Only half of eligible over-s have received a third dose of Covid vaccine one month into the programme, NHS figures suggest. Of the . million people over  who had a second jab more than six months ago, fewer than . million have had the booster. The number of people aged  to  admitted to hospital has risen  per cent in the past week admissions are up  per cent among people over .  Delays to the booster programme will have to be “resolved immediately” to avoid unnecessary pressures on the NHS, said Duncan Robertson, of Warwick University. “Booster vaccinations are there to prevent hospitalisations and ultimately to save lives. Delays matter,” he said. Those who are currently eligible for getting a third dose of the Covid vaccine are people are “most at risk from Covid- who have had a second dose of a vaccine at least six months ago,” according to the NHS. About  million people over the age of  and vulnerable adults will be offered boosters by the end of winter, but at the current rate of , a day, some in their early fties may not have booster jabs until mid-February – about eight months after most received their second dose. Face masks could be made mandatory by law and vaccine passports demanded for nightclubs at a weekaposs notice under a winter ‘Plan B’ unveiled by government last month.Health Secretary Sajid Javid announced Englandaposs Covid Plan A through to March, telling MPs there will be five pillars to keep the virus at bay and avoid another lockdown.They are vaccination and boosters testing, tracing and self-isolation money for the NHS and care general advice like meeting outside or with windows open and wearing face masks in indoor crowded spaces and taking an international approach.

French pharmaceutical firm Valneva has today reported positive results from its Covid- trial after the UK Government scrapped a deal for Valnevaaposs Covid- vaccine last month.The UK had about  million doses on order and Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Valnevaaposs Scottish manufacturing site in Livingston in January.Valneva said its latest trial, on , participants aged  and older across  trial sites in Britain, showed the vaccine prompted a stronger immune response and fewer side-effects than AstraZenecaaposs shot. In new phase three results reported on Monday, the Valneva vaccine showed around % higher neutralising antibody titer levels compared with the vaccine from AstraZeneca in a head-to-head trial.  The company also said its vaccine - VLA - induced broad T-cell responses, a part of the immune system believed to be involved in long-term immunity. Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol and trial chief investigator, told a briefing that the figure for the vaccineaposs efficacy would come when the jab is used in the population. He said the Valneva jab is expected to be at least as effective as, and potentially more effective than the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. But he said the efficacy of a vaccine is not proportional to the antibody titers that it generates, and there tended to be a threshold above which people were protected against infection or serious illness. Enough antibody is what you need and more antibody may not be any better, he added. The phase three trial recruited , people across  trial sites in the UK, including around , who took part in the comparison with AstraZeneca.  The number of Covid- cases was similar between those given AstraZeneca and those given Valneva, the firm said. It added that the complete absence of any severe Covid- cases may suggest that both vaccines used in the study prevented severe symptoms caused by circulating iants, mainly the Delta iant. Prof Finn said: The low levels of reactogenicity and high al antibody responses alongside broad T-cell responses seen with this adjuvanted inactivated whole-virus vaccine are both impressive and extremely encouraging. This is a much more traditional approach to vaccine manufacture than the vaccines so far deployed in the UK, Europe and North America, and these results suggest this vaccine candidate is on track to play an important role in overcoming the pandemic.  He told the briefing that it was unclear how the current vaccines would perform in the future and so more vaccines and more vaccine s could only be a good thing. Thomas Lingelbach, chief executive officer of Valneva, said: These results confirm the advantages often associated with inactivated whole-virus vaccines. We are committed to bringing our dferentiated vaccine candidate to licensure as quickly as possible and continue to believe that we will be able to make an important contribution to the global fight against the Covid- pandemic. Valneva started commercially manufacturing VLA at its Livingston site, which it describes as a globally qualied manufacturing site for viral vaccines, in January this year and will continue to do so. It expects to finalise its submission to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyfor regulatory approval in November, with the hope the vaccine will be approved by the end of the year. Valneva hopes to initially get the jab approved for those aged  to  owing to the age range of people in the trial. The companyaposs site in Solna, Sweden, provides full fill and finish operations for VLA.

So, what’s going on  Greg Murray, a psychology researcher with expertise in mood, sleep and the circadian system , has explained why this happens.  Professor Murray says: “In a normal night’s sleep, our neurobiology reaches a turning point around  or am. “Core body temperature starts to rise, sleep drive is reducing , secretion of melatoninhas peaked, and levels of cortisolare increasing as the body prepares to launch us into the day.“Remarkably, all this activity happens independent of cues from the environment such as dawn light – nature decided long ago that sunrise and sunset are so important that they must be predicted .“We actually wake up many times each night, and light sleep is more common in the second half of the night. When sleep is going well for us, we are simply unaware of these awakenings. But add a bit of stress and there is a good chance that waking will become a fully self-aware state. “Not surprisingly, there is evidence the pandemic is a sleep-disturbing stressor. Soyou’re experiencing am wakings at the moment, you’re definitely not alone. “Stress also impacts sleep in insomnia, where people become hypervigilant about being awake. “Concerns about being awake when one “should” be asleep can cause the person to jolt themselves into anxious wakefulness whenever they go through a light sleep phase.  “If that sounds like you, be aware that insomnia responds well to psychological treatment with cognitive behavioural therapy. There’s also a strong link between sleep and depression, so it’s important to speak to your doctoryou have any concerns about your sleep.” “As a cognitive therapist, I sometimes joke the only thing good about am waking is that it gives us all a vivid example of catastrophising,” Professor Murray says. “Around this time in the sleep cycle, we’re at our lowest ebb physically and cognitively. From nature’s viewpoint, this is meant to be a time of physical and emotional recovery, so it’s understandable that our internal resources are low. “But we also lack other resources in the middle of the night – social connections, cultural assets, all the coping skills of an adult are unavailable at this time. With none of our human skills and capital, we are left alone in the dark with our thoughts. So the mind is partly right when it concludes the problems it’s generated are unsolvable – at am, most problems literally would be. “Once the sun’s up, we’re listening to the radio, chewing our Vegemite toast and pushing the cat off the bench, and our am problems are put in perspective. We can’t believe the solution of just ringing this person, postponing that thing, or checking such-and-such was overlooked in the wee hours.“The truth is, our mind isn’t really looking for a solution at am. We might think we are problem solving by mentally working over issues at this hour, but this isn’t really problem solving it’s problem solving’s evil twin – worry.“Worry is identying a problem, ruminating about the worst possible outcome and neglecting the resources we would bring to bear should the non-preferred outcome actually occur.” Professor Murray adds: “Have you noticed the am thoughts are very self-focused  In the quiet dark, it’s easy to slide unknowingly into a state of extreme egocentricity. Circling round the concept “I”, we can generate painful backwards-looking feelings like guilt or regret. Or turn our tired thoughts to the always uncertain future, generating baseless fears. “Buddhism has a strong position on this type of mental activity: the self is a fiction, and that fiction is the source of all distress. Many of us now practise Buddhist-informed mindfulness to manage stress in the daytime I use mindfulness to deal with am wakings. “I bring my attention to my senses, specically the sound of my breath. When I notice thoughts arising, I gently bring my attention back to the sound of breathing . “Sometimes this meditation works. Sometimes it doesn’t. If I’m still caught in negative thinking after  or  minutes, I follow the advice from cognitive behavioural therapy, and get up, turn on dim light and read. “This action may seem mundane, but at am it is powerfully compassionate, and can help draw you out of your unproductive thinking. “One last tip: It’s important to convince yourselfthat you want to avoid catastrophic thinking. For good reasons not to worry, you can’t go past the Stoic philosophers. “Waking and worrying at am is very understandable and very human. But in my opinion, not a great habit to get into.” Comment MORE ON Mental healthInsomniaTherapySleep\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

When Nicola published the footage online, some people told her to contact the police to report the incident. She said she contacted Merseyside Police but is now terried of leaving the house alone with her dogs in case there are attempts to steal them.  Nicola said: I had just popped out with my son and could see on my phone they were at the door so I got home as quickly as possible and then I watched the video. Our front door has glass and you can see straight through, when Iaposm in we have the curtain closed over it but thataposs dficult to do as youaposre going out of the door. The man rang our normal doorbell not the ring bell and you can see the dogs are going mental. When I watched it at first I didnapost realise what heaposd said, but then I watched it again. One of our dogs is a fluffy white thing and you can see him look in the direction of the kitchen and say apospomeranianapos and write it down. I have no idea why he said it out loud like there. Itaposs not a Pomeranian but I suppose it could look a bit like one. She said that after posting the footage on the Crimewatch Wirral group, some locals said they had witnessed similar incidents before. The woman added: When I rang the police and they were really helpful and apparently there were a few reports of dogs being targeted in this way. A lady who lives up the road said someone she knew had that happen to her and now Iaposm petried of leaving them in the house. Iaposm scared to go for a walk with them in the dark on my own and wonapost do that now. Iaposm worried now about what will happen. A spokesperson for Merseyside Police said: We were contacted at .pm on Thursday th October, by a resident of Frankby Road in West Kirby following reports that  minutes earlier a man had been seen on her Ring doorbell looking through her door and window. The male left a short time later. There is no suggestion he attempted to enter the property. Local policing officers have been made aware.

The restaurant chain, known for the tight-fitting unorms worn by its female staff, has now said it will allow employees to “choose” which unorm they wish to wear.In a statement to Insider, a spokesperson for Hooters said: “As we continue to listen and update the image of the Hooters Girls, we are clarying that they have the option to choose from traditional unorms or the new ones.They can determine which style of shorts best fits their body style and personal image. It followed its previous decision to replace already-short shorts for new skin-tight, bikini-cut bottoms, which some of its staff compared to underwear.  A series of viral TikTok videos shared by Hooters staff show employees speaking out against the shorts while others have threatened to quit as a result of the unorm change. “Oh look, a wedgie!” Hooters employee and medical student Kristen Songer, , said as she revealed the new shorts. “This is why all the Hooters girls are upset — because this is not what I agreed to wear a year ago when I was hired.”  In another video, one person compared the two shorts with the caption: “Love my job but don’t love wearing undies to work.” Another TikTok user said: “Soooo Hooters got new panties. I mean shorts.” The unorm change did receive positive feedback from some staff, one who said she was obsessed with the shorts while another asked Am I the only Hootie that loves the new shorts    “I’ve been making way more money with the new shorts,” a third said. Hooters has repeatedly come under fire for promoting the objectication of women through mandatory barely-there unorms, as well as staff beauty pageants and girl calendars.  The bar and restaurant chain launched in  with a unique selling point serving staff made up entirely of attractive, young women wearing orange hotpants and tight tops. Hooters of America, the franchisor and operator of Hooters restaurants, operates more than  franchise locations across  states and  countries. The company’s spokesperson added that the shorts were “the result of a collaboration with Hooters Girls and have been worn for months in several Texas markets with overwhelmingly positive feedback”. They said that Hooters appreciates the feedback, both positive and negative, regarding a more accommodating and inclusive image policy on tattoos, jewelry, nails, hairstyles as well as new unorm options — to include new top styles, shorts, and the addition of socks. The company said it plans to continue to work with employees and give them opportunities for providing input at every stage including future clothing items and accessories. Weaposre excited to see a national trend toward self-expression and inclusivity that bodes well for our marketplace, the spokesperson continued. We work continuously with our Hooters Girls to refresh and update the image of our brand ambassadors and to empower them to feel their best while at work.

The -year-old always saw the good in people, which meant she treated everyone she met like a friend.But it also made her vulnerable and prone to being hurt.In , Alexandria – known as Ally and originally from St Louis, Missouri – was studying for a marketing degree at the University of Mississippi, in the city of Oxford, USA.She also taught fitness classes on campus and had started a golf club. In her freshman year in , she had met business student Brandon Theesfeld. Although they had never officially been a couple, they had dated on and off over the years. Ally’s friends knew that she had fallen for Theesfeld, but that he didn’t treat her very well and could be emotionally abusive. She would show them texts of him blowing hot and cold with his affections – saying he loved her one minute and then denying it the next.Students said Theesfeld was arrogant and liked to brag about his family’s wealth. Some even called him a misogynist. He liked to play the field and wasn’t committed to Ally. But Ally had some news for him.In April, she messaged Theesfeld to say she thought she might be pregnant.She sent him a picture of an inconclusive home pregnancy test and told him they needed to talk.Theesfeld started to ignore her messages and rumours started to circulate around campus.Ally’s friends heard she might be pregnant and other students heard that Theesfeld wasn’t very happy about it and wanted her to have an abortion.He thought a baby would ruin his le and his future.Ally tearfully told her friends she didn’t want an abortion.She wanted Theesfeld to meet her but their communication was purely electronic for the next three months. Ally had no clue just how badly the potential baby news had gone down. Theesfeld’s internet history showed he was researching abortion pills and services. And he travelled home to Dallas, Texas, and posted a photo on social media of a Glock pistol his dad had bought. The caption read, “Finally taking my baby back to Oxford.”On  July, he started to research gun silencers, ammunition and tactical face masks. Theesfeld also looked into how serial killer Ted Bundy had lured his victims to their deaths.Occasionally, he would agree to meet Ally but cancel at the last minute or not show up. On  July, Ally was out for the evening. Surveillance footage captured her leaving a nightclub in Oxford before midnight.She walked along and was looking on her phone. After ing home, she slipped out again without her roommates noticing.Then, at around .am the next day, a routine police patrol discovered a body in the remote area around Sardis Lake – a popular place for students to hang out, about  miles from downtown Oxford. The body was identied as Ally.She had been shot eight times in the stomach and her purse was found dumped a mile away. Straight away, Theesfeld was the prime suspect. He had messaged Ally the night before, asking her to tell him when she was leaving the bar.His truck was seen heading to her home around am, then towards the lake. Gunshots were heard at around .am at the lake and Theesfeld’s phone placed him leaving the area  minutes later.The bullets used to kill Ally were also the type for the gun he’d bragged about on social media.On  July, Theesfeld was arrested at a petrol station in Tennessee and charged with capital murder.He had blood on his clothing and his gun was found in his truck. It was matched to the bullets that killed Ally.Investigators determined that he had lured Ally to meet him and killed her to stop her having the baby.Tragically, an autopsy found Ally had not been pregnant after all. Had she really believed she was  We will never know.Theesfeld was facing a death sentence on the capital murder charge, so he made a plea deal.This August, Theesfeld, , pleaded guilty to first-degree murder. The prosecution said he had been unhappy believing that Ally was pregnant. They spoke about a letter he had written to his family, which was found after his arrest.“I’m not a good person. It is not your fault,” he wrote. “Something in me just doesn’t work. I’ve always had terrible thoughts. I know I’m going to get caught.”The prosecution said Theesfeld had tried to pressure Ally into getting an abortion and he had messaged suggesting that he had “felt becoming a father at this point in his le would ruin his le”. So he had taken his gun and lured Ally to her death, driving her to the lake and repeatedly shooting her.Afterwards, he had even looked up “Sardis, Mississippi news” – presumably to seeher body had been found. The defence agreed after a mental evaluation that Theesfeld was sane and competent to face trial.But they claimed drugs and alcohol influenced his behaviour.In September this year, Theesfeld faced sentencing. He apologised to Ally’s family but had no explanation for his terrible crime.“My actions have forever changed your lives and my family’s lives,” he said.“I wish I could take it all back but I can’t. There is no excuse for my actions. I hope one day that you will find it in your hearts to forgive me.”Ally’s heartbroken mum, Cindy, had written a letter that was read out in court, describing Ally as “bright, compassionate, sweet and hardworking”.It went on, “I wish I could have kept her away from this evil, callous, scheming, ungrateful, sinister and violent and corrupt monster. He had every opportunity to do good in the world but he chose to do evil. “Brandon, you belong in jail each day for the rest of your le for the heinous act you committed to such a sweet soul in Ally. Every time your cell door slams shut, may it be a reminder for what you did and the le you took from us.”Theesfeld was sentenced to le in prison and will be eligible for parole when he is . The case that had rocked the university two years earlier had finally come to an end.

Cafe Strawberry was inspired to jump on the bandwagon in a bid to fuel its pandemic recovery by recreating some of the games from the gory show. In a dark room lit with neon colours, customers are welcomed by staff dressed as the ominous masked guards, who are holding toy guns. They are ushered towards the end of the room where the chilling red light, green light playground game starts.

So, you can understand why so many people have been left baffled over one woman, who used a lump sum of £, to pay for just  months rent upfront.TikTok user Britt @.britttook to the app to reveal it had been a learning curve when she paid for a yearaposs rent on a house in Alderley Edge in Cheshire, which is one of the most expensive places to live in the country.  Where were you staying please    The Shard   For £k a month    one TikTok user questioned, while another added: What kind of a place was £k a month rent !! In fact, the -year-old didnapost even end up staying in the home, as she found the area too Tory but confirmed she did get her money back for the months she was not living in the property. I was renting in Alderley Edge in Cheshire and I moved like, somewhere , because it was too Tory for me, but we got the money back for the months that we didn’t live there, she explained in a follow up clip, adding: So, it’s all good but still, like, who does that  Me.

No… Did no one in your le at the time tell you that’s not normal  another added. She replied: Yes, I was just stubborn.

You canapost really beat a chain which specialises in a good old Sunday dinner, can you  Or so you might think. According to TripAdvisor, many diners would disagree, with one particular branch of the restaurant chain taking a particular beating on the rating site.A Toby Carvery in Oldhamaposs Chadderton Park, in Greater Manchester, has been branded the worst place to eat ever, prompted the Manchester Evening Newsapos journalist Hana Kelly to go and check it out for herself.Food awful service even worse, worse place to eat ever, one review reads, while another diner wrote: Donapost have the Yorkshire puddings unless you want to lose a tooth or two. However, others tell of vastly dferent experiences as one reviewer writes: Amazing food, nice and warm, good service  good options. The server was fast and the food was cheap, but what did Hana think  Hereaposs her review.  What’s cooking  A delicious plate, full to bursting with fluffy yet crunchy roast potatoes, a Yorkshire pudding so crisp and rosy, it almost seems a shame to coat it in a thick, rich gravy. The veg should have a crunch, a sweet flavour to counteract the savoury deliciousness of the meat and the mix of trimmings, from stuffing to sauces should capture your senses before you’ve even taken a bite. At this Toby’s, the offering hit maybe % of this description. The Yorkshire pudding: truly faultless. It was golden with a crunch to match autumn leaves. The gravy: thick, flavourful, available in both meatysaurus and vegetarian options. The rest: Eh, acceptable. The turkey was dry. The kind of dry that meant when the carver was carving it, it cut not in slices but in small, frayed chunks like sawdust. The potatoes, in roasted form, were crisp on the outside and that’s that, no fluff, not much flavour. Meanwhile in mashed form, they were sweet and goopy. The vegetables were acceptable, certainly nothing worthy of review.  Are you being served  The enjoyment of post-Covid self service was definitely something missed by the patrons of the Chadderton Park Toby Carvery. One reviewer, who left one star on Tripadvisor, described the lack of self service during the pandemic as ‘not enjoyable at all’. They said: “The carvers throw it all on a plate on top of each other so it looks like a dogaposs dinner. But low and behold, self serve has ed, once your meat and Yorkshire are safely home on your plate, you can choose your own. A smiley waiter leads you to a table, takes your drink order and lets you know you may head for the carvery when ready. I sat for a few minutes contemplating what it meant to be ready before realising I just needed to get my dinner. However, this doesn’t mean there isn’t still confusion over the systems. One couple waited at their table for over  minutes wonderingthey’d been forgotten before flagging down a waiter and discovering they were meant to serve themselves. What’s the damage  If there’s one thing for certain, for a full roast the price is right. At a wonderfully affordable £., it is a good deal and great value for money. The verdict  As a Toby Carvery first timer, the meal was sadly disappointing. The staff were polite and relaxed, explaining the process, and serving drinks and the bill quickly. The atmosphere was warm and friendly, with laughter heard from many tables and tasty gravy smells wafting all throughout the pub. The queue at the carvery station was non-existent, meaning my food was still piping hot back at the table. There was ample parking, but the pothole ridden car park could have destroyed a caraposs suspension. But for a pub that sells itself on its roast, I’ve definitely cooked better.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

But, itaposs fair to say that couples probably should think about discussing their separate and joint spending before making the commitment of tying the knot. In the not-too-distant past, it wasnapost uncommon for the man of the house to control the spending, given that in many circumstances, he would be the one to go out and earn the money while the woman of the house was considered the aposhomemakerapos. These days, however, in the majority of modern households, this is a far cry from reality.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. One man, who married his we earlier this year, has sparked an interesting debate online, after he revealed he was putting his we on a spending ban, after she spent the first seven months of their marriage on what he described as a spending spree.Sheaposs been spending hundreds at a time on clothes, accessories, makeup and all others that fall within that ilk, little trinkets for interior design, just spending all of the time, the -year-old man explained on Redditaposs Am I The A**hole forum.I make an okay living and the only reason we arenapost under water is because I donapost buy anything. After running up £ on a coat, I finally decided enough was enough. I built a spreadsheet, explained it to her, and wanted to handle things like adults. She acted like she was nodding off, struggling to stay away, she looked like a high school kid stuck in the most boring class in the school. Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it. Email us at yourmirror@mirrorThe man said he was expecting the conversation to turn into a fight as he thought it was perfectly fair, but his we argued that the budget didnapost benefit both of them and saw it was her husband dominating and constricting her. He then turned to Reddit to question whether he was in the wrong an he was met with ying responses. How on earth did you not talk about finances before you chose to get married  one Reddit user questioned, while another added: I donapost think lining out a budget is a bad thing. But it should include everything. Bills, living expenses and savings. Not just a budget for her. A third added: Everyone needs a budget, but this is something that should have been hammered out before you got married. Thereaposs a reason that money is a leading cause of orce. Personally, Iaposm a fan of yours, mine, and ours funds. Both partners get an equal monthly allowance to spend however they want, no questions asked. Anything  gets put into the aposoursapos fund and thataposs used for household costs. any household cost outside of normal bills over a certain amount has to be approved by both people. So, she can buy her £ coat with her monthly money after she saves up. but it comes out of her money, not joint money.What do you think, should couples have set in stone budgets  Have your say in the comments section..Comment MORE ON RelationshipsMarriage\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The man, known only as aposthe Mayorapos, has over , tapes in his home, many of which are extremely rare as they were withdrawn because ofissues. The aposirreplaceableapos collection stretches from floor to ceiling in his house in Liverpool, and one room is a faithful recreation of an old Blockbusters rental store, complete with illuminated sign. The Mayor has so many videos that heaposs now running out of space, but he says heaposll never give up his collection as finding rare tapes is his hobby and passion. What do you think about the Mayoraposs collection  Let us know in the commentsHe said: Iaposm always building it and building it. Itaposs a full-time occupation and I travel all over the country to get video collections. Iaposve also found some in a skip in Watford. There will always be a gem in there, a catalogue filler. I first started collecting in  when I went to a car boot sale. I wanted to own my video shop one day but then DVDs came out and ruined that idea.  I always buy ex-rental tapes because they were built to last longer on high-grade tape and the quality doesnapost degrade, unlike sell-thru retail videos. They only last around  plays and the quality in picture and sound would degrade, and they arenapost worth anything. When videos were dying out I still continued to collect ex-rental VHS tapes. I couldnapost see the point in buying films on DVD that I already owned and have to pay yet more money. They are arranged by date in catalogue order number. Even though there are so many, I can find any title pretty much instantly.  Many of the Mayoraposs videos are highly sought-after pre-certs - referring to the period in the early days of VHS tape when they did not require a certicate from the British Board of Film Classication.This all changed following the video nasty moral panic of the early s, when the market was flooded by cheaply made, gory horror films which anyone could buy or rent. Later, videos had to be given a certicate in the same way that cinema releases were.He has multiple copies of particular titles - such as Alien and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre - as the packaging was dferent each time it was released, depending on whether it was a apospre-certapos or apospost-certapos copy. The Mayor said: The collection as a whole is irreplaceable, and must be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. Iaposm so glad that I never replaced my collection with DVDs because theyaposre worth nothing these days and yet again another format came out to replace DVD anyway. What gets me is how people still keep replacing their films with so-called better formats and keep wasting money, then a new format will come out of the same film they upgraded and off they go upgrading again.

My collection has grown massively in recent years, through buying ious job lots on eBay and other sources.I have no idea how many I actually own as it would be very hard to count, but there are absolutely thousands here and it must be one of the biggest in the country. But now Iaposm running out of room. I need to get my museum off the ground. Itaposs a fun passion, keeps me entertained and I donapost think I could ever sell them. I only sell my swaps but thataposs it. Every tape that Iaposve not got that comes in goes straight into the collection. If youaposre thinking of collecting tapes then be sure to only buy ex-rental as the retail tapes will near enough be unwatchable over time. If you have a collection of tapes make sure theyaposre not stored in a damp place as they can become mouldy, so avoid the garage or garden shed.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

He called his neighbour who came over with some bear sprayThe family was shocked to find a huge black bear standing up at a desk in a bedroom Image: Sean ReddyByPeter BarkerChiara Fiorillo:,  Oct | commentsA dad has captured the moment a -stone bear broke into his house and sat on his sonaposs gaming chair. Sean Reddy said a black bear entered his property through an open bedroom window on October . He said he was cleaning up his garden because a bear had made a mess after knocking over the bins the night before. But as he walked around his garden in Alberta, Canada, his two dogs suddenly became very agitated. Sean said he recognised the dogsapos behaviour as they displayed it before when there was a bear nearby. The dogs soon had the bear cornered near the garage, but Sean shouted at them to back off as the animal could have seriously injured them.  He said: The bear did not seem too fazed by my dogs and I was yelling at them to call them back so as not to get killed by the bear. I locked them [the dogs] in my shop and closed the door to leave the bear alone. The bear then made its way into the garage where it got its paws on dog food and some items in the freezer. Sean told his children, Ronan and Cormac, to stay inside and not go anywhere near the garage as the bear was there. The family watched the bear from their window and assumed that after finishing the food it would head back into the woods. However, just minutes later -year-old Cormac asked his dad what all the scratching he could hear coming from the other end of the house was. Ronan then shouted to his dad, saying the bear was now in the hallway. The dad said: I went in to see and sure enough there it was. I donapost remember what I said orI was yelling at the bear, but thataposs when he walked into Cormacaposs room.  Sean thought a window was open in the room so he shut the door and hoped that the bear would leave the same way it came in. He rushed outside to checkthe window really was open only to find that it was shut. He said: Now just realising that I had locked the bear in Cormacaposs room, I ran back into the house to see and went down the hallway to find out my son Liam had left his bedroom window wide open and thataposs where the bear had come in. Sean said the bear had climbed through Liamaposs room, across his bed, and then wandered through the house to Cormacaposs room. He added: I wasnapost sure what to do, thinking the bear was going to be p****d off at me for being locked in the room.  With Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Fish and Wildle officials unreachable, Sean was left to his own devices when it came to removing the bear from his sonaposs bedroom. He called his neighbour Chris who came over with some anti-bear spray. Sean said: We decided to get a bunch of furniture ready to block off the hallway, there is a bookshelf by Cormacaposs bedroom which I had pulled back thinking at leastI opened up the door and a mad bear was coming out I had a bookshelf between us. However, when he opened the bedroom door the bear did not show itself. Sean explained: I climbed over the small bookshelf to look in, and the bear was at the computer desk looking back at me asto say aposwhat do you want apos He added: Thataposs when I said to the guys here aposI have to take a picture because no one will believe me!apos The bear walked across the hallway back towards the bedroom and left shortly after Sean took the picture of it by his sonaposs gaming chair. The bear has not been seen since, but Sean says that bear sightings are not uncommon near the familyaposs home although normally they keep to the garden and the garage.

Tens of thousands of dissidents and political prisoners are reportedly harvested in China every year as part of a barbaric black market operation led by the Chinese governmentA Falun Gong follower displays torture methods they claim Chinese authorities used against their members in China Image: ReutersByAlex BellottiNews Features Writer:,  Oct | commentsCalled to a remote hillside on a hot summeraposs day, Dr Enver Tothi felt a chill down his spine as gunshots rang out across the fields. Walking his team over the summit, the medical expert was greeted by the sight of up to  men wearing prisonersapos unorms collapsed leless on the ground. Their heads had been blown off by military police who stood over twitching corpses - the job of Dr Tothi was to harvest fresh organs, which have become a valuable commodity on the Chinese black market. The horric scenes may sound eerily similarly to the side plot in Netflixaposs smash hit drama Squid Game, but the gruesome practice is all too real.Human rights groups in China claim the government is operating an organ-trafficking network that harvests as many as , dissidents and political prisoners every year.Hearts, kidneys, livers and even corneas are all removed on an industrial scale, campaigners say - while those involved have revealed grim secrets of witnessing the barbaric scenes first-hand. Organs aposharvestedapos like in Netflix hit Since its release last month, Squid Game has quickly become the most-viewed international show in Netflixaposs history. The creepy South Korean thriller sees desperate contestants battle it out in childhood-inspired games to win millions of pounds - the catch being thatthey fail, they die. Get the biggest news delivered to your inbox.for the Mirroraposs free newslettersWhile the far-fetched premise thankfully isnapost inspired by real le, a side plot sees workers for the aposgameapos dragging off injured participants to harvest their organs and sell them off. Just months before the showaposs release, UN human rights experts warned they were extremely alarmed by reports of alleged organ harvesting in real le. Minorities including followers of the religious movement Falun Gong, Uyghurs, Tibetans, Muslims and Christians are being targeted in detention in China, the reports claim. The UN experts say they have received credible information that detainees are being mysteriously subjected to blood tests and organ examinations such as ultrasound and x-rays - without consent. “Forced organ harvesting in China appears to be targeting specic ethnic, linguistic or religious minorities held in detention, often without being explained the reasons for arrest or given arrest warrants, at dferent locations,” they said. “We are deeply concerned by reports of discriminatory treatment of the prisoners or detainees based on their ethnicity and religion or belief. “According to the allegations received, the most common organs removed from the prisoners are reportedly hearts, kidneys, livers, corneas and, less commonly, parts of livers. This form of trafficking with a medical nature allegedly involves health sector professionals, including surgeons, anaesthetists and other medical specialists.”  China is facing a huge shortage of organs that can be used for transplants, but under controversial rules recipients can book surgeries for specic dates and locations. This doesnapost happen in other countriesapos systems, as surgeons cannot predict when a potential donor will die. Under Chinaaposs rules, the donoraposs organs will be sent to the most urgent patient on a waiting list who is within travelling distance. This has allowed the country to establish a horric aposkill to orderapos system, but despite widespread condemnation, Beijing has been able to cover it up by under-reporting transplant figures to the World Health Organisation.A recent statistical analysis of Chinaaposs current organ transplant system showed the numbers China has been putting out have been falsied, Susie Hughes, executive director of The International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China, told Daily Mail Australia.When you examine hospital revenues, bed utilisation rates and the number of surgical teams from the official Chinese data... the figure is more likely to be between , to , transplants per year. aposI became a robot... you carry out what you are programmed toapos China has persecuted a number of minority groups over the years, with thousands of Falun Gong detained as religious prisoners around the turn of the century. In , human rights lawyers began campaigning on the issue of organ harvesting, but  years later, little has been done to curb the sickening practice.  While the Falun Gong were once the target of the authorities, following its effective dissolution as a movement the Uighur - an ethnic group of Muslims now largely situated in the north-west of China - became the new scapegoat.Last year, the China Tribunal published a landmark  page report after  months of investigation into organ harvesting in the country. Dr Tothi - who now works as a London Uber driver - contributed to the enquiry, having been forced to remove a prisoners organs while working as a doctor in .I became a robot, the father-of-three told MirrorOnline. You carry out what you are programmed to do. When I cut through there was bleeding, which means the heart was still beating. I understood why. This man was shot to the right chest. They knocked him out but did not let him die immediately so I had time to remove the organs.  It was an easy and quick operation which took  to  minutes. Even less because it’s a destructive operation. The chief surgeon put the organs in a box and said aposnow you take your team back to hospital, and today nothing happenedapos. When Dr Tothi was made to carry out the brutal surgery, the Chinese Communist Party was concerned with the Falun Gong - a religious group that top brass considered to be a grave threat to their authority. The identity of the man he was forced to operate on, without anesthetic, remains a mystery to him. Prisoner x-rayed at horric concentration camp Tens of thousands of Falun Gong prisoners of conscience are thought to have been killed so that their organs could be sold in the lucrative black market.Among the lucky survivors was Jenner Zeng, who was saved from having her innards plundered by a chance admission to a prison guard. For  hours a day the mum-of-one was forced to stand in the sun and recite regulations at a prison camp in Beijing until she fainted, at which point a guard would shock her awake with an electric batton. Itaposs very sad, because we failed to stop them when they did this to Falun Gong, Ms Zeng toldof the state-run programme of forced organ harvesting. The western world funded this persecution by investing in China. Thenow has the power to expand this mass murder to Uighur and the people of Hong Kong. During her time in the camp Ms Zeng was taken to a medical facility where she had her eyes tested and her organs touched. She explained to the doctor that she had been infected with hepatitis C during a blood transfusion after giving birth, but had been cured of it in the process of practising Falun Gong. A month later she and several thousand inmates were taken in shackles in large buses with their windows blacked out to a hospital where they were x-rayed. At a smaller clinic back at the camp their blood was taken without explanation. It was only after her release that Ms Zeng learned that the authorities had been removing the organs of prisoners to be sold to wealthy and powerful people, from China and from overseas. Only at that stage, I realised what a narrow escape I had, she explained.  If I had not told the doctor I had had hepatitis C, I could have become a victim as well. From my first dayI had a strange feeling. Is this real  Have I been sent to the concentration camps in the history books  Could this be happening in the st century  We read about it in the history books but it doesnapost happen anymore. I had been transferred to the Nazi concentration camps. That kind of feeling haunted me for a long time. aposMy name is the butcher... itaposs like slaughtering pigsapos Also included in the  report is a transcript of a telephone call between an investigator and Zhu Jiabin, who admits to murdering and harvesting the organs of Gao Yixi in . Asked about the harvesting, Jiabin says: Sold them!’ After slaughtering and opening up the belly, you just carve out the organs and sell them. I only know to sell organs for money after organ harvesting. That is my principle... If you had guts to stand in front of me now I would live organ harvest you... My name is ‘the butcher’... I am called the butcher specialising in live organ harvesting... Itaposs nothing, just like slaughtering pigs. You come over to shave their hair first and then split open the belly. I would carve out whatever I need. After scooping the organs out, I would sell them.Last year, a group of doctors were found to have harvested the organs of car crash victims and then sold them for cash.Six people, including four doctors, were jailed in China having been caught up in the countryaposs thriving organ black market. It followed growing reports that the country was executing Muslim prisoners and taking their organs to treat patients dying of Covid-. Concerns were raised after Beijing boasted about a successful double transplant operation on a patient given just days to live. Human rights groups questioned how the -year-oldaposs two matched lungs were found in a matter of days.Got a story  Get in touch by emailing alex.bellotti@reachplcComment MORE ON Squid GameNetflixChinese Communist PartyFalun Gong\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But did you know it can also cause problems with your bones Dr Atiyah Kamran, a consultant gynaecologist at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, says it#s important for women to look after their bone health to avoid osteoporosis.When women reach the age of menopause their oies stop producing high levels of hormones in the body.During the reproductive years, the hormone oestrogen helps to thicken the lining of the womb and stimulate the growth of egg follicles.But it#s also important for helping other parts of the body, contributing to our cognitive health, the cardiovascular system and how we absorb calcium.Oestrogen helps to protect our bones and, when levels of the hormone start declining in our s and s, it can lead to bone loss.A woman can lose up to % of her bone density during the five years following menopause which can lead to osteoporosis.Their bones become thinner causing them to fracture more easily.Today, on World Menopause Day, Dr Kamran has given some advice on how we can protect our bones.In the first instance, women should talk to their GPs to find outthey are likely to be suffering from menopause.Doctors can usually confirm it based on your symptoms butyou#re under the age of  a blood test can be taken to measure your hormone levels.Dr Kamran says it could be the case you#ll benefit from hormone replacement therapy , which will help replace lost oestrogen.#Not everyone needs HRT after menopause buta woman is suffering and her quality of le is suffering and she wants some relief from it then the options are available,# Dr Kamran said.#Every woman should have the right to ask.#Yes, there is. Dr Kamran says taking supplements and certain exercises can help.#Weight bearing exercises are considered good so walking, running, skipping – anything that would produce some weight on your joints,# she says.#It doesn’t have to be high intensity exercises.#We can also take supplements such as Vitamin B and Vitamin D. Living a healthy lestyle, reducing how much alcohol we drink and stopping smoking will also help.There#s also several natural remedies sold in health shops and on the internet such as red clover extract and black cohosh.They#re said to be effective because they contact plant-based compounds that mimic the action of the oestrogen hormone.But Dr Kamran warns we don#t know about the concentration of many of these products sold on the internet and they can react with other medications.#People with no other medical products can use these productsthey think that it helps them butthey use other medications it’s best to get advice from their doctor,# she said.#There are lots of things available on the internet but we do not knowthey improve the situation but they can cause harmunregulated amounts are used.#World Menopause Day is held every year to raise awareness of menopause and the support options available.If you#re looking for more information about menopause and the help you can receive visit the Menopause Matters website or The British Menopause Society.Here#s how you can be happy without chasing big achievements in your lePetition launched to get new hospital in Shetland Warning over infant virus doctors deem more concerning than Covid Man who hit #rock bottom# turns le around with boxingFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.59340468-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.59340468-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.59340468-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.59340468-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"take away takeover of empty supermarket in inverurie town centre","story":"Inverurie fast food fans will soon have another menu to browse after plans to convert an abandoned town centre supermarket were approved.

down against Dundee, a goal from United States international Christian Ramirez gave hope at least a draw could be salvaged, but the Reds were unable to build on that.The quality may be missing in front of goal and the defence prone to mistakes, but Glass insists he cannot fault the players# work-rate.He said: #The one thing I can#t level at the players is lack of effort.#That has been a constant all season.#If they continue working as hard as they are, I can see it turning.#I know how dficult it is going to be, but I back the players and I can see players that are capable of changing things.#Aberdeen now face a challenging run of games against the sides in the top six, starting with Hibs at Pittodrie on Saturday.Following that, they travel to league leaders and defending champions Rangers before facing a Hearts side still undefeated in the Premiership.Following those games, the Reds play Motherwell and Dundee United.Glass said: #They are tough games, but they mean a lot more now because of the situation we are in at the minute.#A lot of teams picked up points at the weekend, while we didn#t, so we are digging a hole.#There is only one set of people who can get us out of it # and I believe we can.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week october 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowInsects are tiny creatures, but they make a massive contribution in keeping our world in balance.They are responsible for the pollination of about  per cent of trees and bushes on the entire planet. Yet we often treat them in a dismissive way.Let#s think about some insects.Take the bluebottle. How often has it outwitted us with its amazing flight paths, ducking and ing to avoid our threatening gestures.While we have developed some of the most sophisticated flying machines the world has known, none can match the bluebottle in its agility.We have mentioned pollination. What insect is more important than the bee as it goes about its business from flower to flower ensuring that the plants will produce seed for another year and giving us honey as a product of its labours.How beautul too are its colours and the structure of its body – a remarkable little insect.Then there is the humble moth and its gravity-defying antics walking across ceilings. It has a very fragile body but in its short le can nevertheless act out its own acrobatic skill in an amazing performance.Or we may think of the spider and the beauty of its web, perhaps seen on a frosty winter morning.

lead at half time.Star looked to put the game to bed as quickly as possible in the second half and did so as Aaron Moore grabbed his second of the afternoon following a slip from the Duncanrig keeper.MacLean was next to double his tally as he proved too sharp for the Duncanrig defence and finished well from a tight angle to make the score - with half an hour to go.This gave manager Weir the chance to ring the changes, with Ryan Caskie coming on to replace Aaron Moore and helping himself to two goals of his own from close range to make the final score -.The only sour note was an injury to goal-scoring substitute Caskie which will rule him out of Star#s next game.Star look to make it back-to-back wins on Saturday October , again on their travels to Port Glasgow OBU."},{"url":null,"title":"art and smarten up for tarbert thrift shop","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThanks to a shop front improvement grant from Argyll and Bute Council, the Tarbert Church of Scotland was able to spruce up its charity shop in the village.The  per cent grant helped towards the cost of painting and erecting new signs at the thrt shop with a specially-commissioned painting of Tarbert with the prominent church and a Church of Scotland emblem.The painting is the remarkable work of talented Tarbert artist Matthew Manao, who studied fine art at Glasgow School of Art, and it makes the perfect connection between the thrt shop to the church.The thrt shop provides a major part of the income for the church and has been a leline to keeping the church going for many years.It has helped provide funds for disabled access to the church through the sale of merchandise with images gted to the church by prominent Mid Argyll artist Jolomo, the late John Leckie and Molly Smith, supported by monetary donations and by the sale of #virtual# bricks.Lisa MacFarlane of Tarbert church said: #We are grateful for the support of the community and the many visitors to Tarbert.#Feel free to join the Church of Scotland in Tarbert, Kilberry and Skipness Facebook page for updates on the church and thrt shop.#The shop front improvement grant utilises Scottish Government Town Centre Funding  with the aim of supporting the local economy by providing employment for tradespeople while helping towns become more attractive places to live, work, visit and invest."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures october 15 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowLike a scene from the heyday of Para Handy and the Clyde puffers, the VIC makes her sedate way from Crinan towards Bellanoch Bridge.Lochgilphead reader Rhona Young kindly sent us her photograph, taken on Saturday October  as the Vic was travelling on the Crinan Canal en route to Cairnbaan."},{"url":null,"title":"huge-day-cross-country-running-borders","story":"THE SCOTTISH Athletics East District Cross Country relays took place in Galashiels on Saturday.Lasswade AC took the senior womenrsquos gold medals thanks to the trio of Amy Smith, Sarah Tait and Amy Frankland.Taitrsquos second leg run was influential in Lasswadersquos win and her time of : over a hilly course at Gala Academy was enough to take the fastest lap title by two seconds from Holly Page .Edinburgh Uni Hare and Hounds took the silver and bronze medals in that race with the surprise being that it was their lsquoCrsquo team who were second with the lsquoArsquo team in third.Just for good measure, the students from Edinburgh were also fourth and fth in an impressive collective performance for the Hare and Hounds.Central won the menrsquos race thanks to the efforts of Calum Phillip, Ben Macmillan, Luca Fonottoli and Hamish Hickey.Edinburgh Uni were second here, too, with Aberdeen AAC coming home third for the bronzes.

We are exceptionally grateful for their continued support and determined to repay that commitment on the pitch whist working closely with them in the wider Borders community.ldquoDuring lockdown we were able to continue to offer rugby activities for the younger children, and during April we were able to support a new Try It Out campaign aimed at children that wouldnrsquot typically have access to rugby or sporting activities because of social or economic barriers. We feel very strongly that the ability to pay shouldnrsquot prevent access to sport.ldquoParents and carers were offered the option to pay what they could, or in some cases nothing at all. Over  boys and girls joined in the fun sessions at the Melrose pitches, and the majority registered to stay on until the end of the summer season. The lting of restrictions has allowed the Southern Knights to launch their buddy scheme aligning some of their semi-professional players to the younger players to help encourage and develop their skills and to inspire children to play to the best of their ability.ldquoThis inclusive ethos is shared by CGI and the award winning Inspire Learning Programme developed in partnership with Scottish Borders Council for pupils from primary four to sixth year in high school throughout the area.ldquoThis uses iPads and an array of other tools to support learning and aims to benefit all children and teachers by raising attainment, support equity and inclusion, and to work towards preparing young people for a digital future. We are keen to continue to support these initiatives in conjunction with CGI over the coming months and years.Dominic Taddei, Chair of Southern Knights Super Board said: ldquoWe are delighted to continue to work a further term with our headline sponsor CGI. Their support through very dficult times has been phenomenal and we look forward to working with them as we get ready to approach the finals day, and to now have the ability to offer a wider audience for FOSROC Super with the fantastic news that was released by Scottish Rugby on rd June  that every Super Sunday fixture has been televised live on free-to-air television by new broadcast partner, FreeSports. The FOSROC Super finals weekend will take place on the weekend of    October, and we look forward to showcasing CGI as our headline sponsor at the finals event.The continuing partnership between CGI and the Southern Knights is not only a relationship supporting sport in the Scottish Borders but also Southern Knights players and coaches are working closely with CGI on community-based initiatives in Borders schools, delivering motivational and inspirational videos for the pupils.

Another group ate a full amount but in a short period of time ndash giving them a long daily fast without reducing calories.The other two groups were given around % fewer calories either once a day or spread over the entire day.That meant some mice had a long daily fast while others ate the same reduced-calorie diet but never fasted, which dfered from most previous studies of calorie restriction.The results suggest that many of the benefits originally linked to calorie restriction alone all required fasting as well.Mice who ate fewer calories without fasting did not see these positive changes, according to the study published in Nature Metabolism.Fasting on its own, without reducing the amount of food eaten, was just as powerful as calorie restriction with fasting, the research suggests.Fasting alone was also enough to improve insulin sensitivity and to reprogramme metabolism to focus more on using fats as a source of energy.The livers of fasting mice also showed the hallmarks of healthier metabolism.However, the researchers did not study the effect of fasting alone on lespan or frailty as mice aged, but other studies have suggested that fasting can provide these benefits as well.While the mice that ate fewer calories without ever fasting did show some improved blood sugar control, they also died younger.Compared with mice who both ate less and fasted, these mice that only ate less died about eight months earlier on average.The team also measured frailty through metrics like grip strength and coat condition.Prof Lamming said: ldquoIn addition to their shorter lespans, these mice were worse in certain aspects of frailty, but better in others.ldquoSo, on balance their frailty didnrsquot change much, but they didnrsquot look as healthy.The primary studies were done in male mice but Prof Lammingrsquos lab also found similar metabolic effects of fasting in female mice.He added: ldquoIf fasting is the main driver of health, we should be studying drugs or diet interventions that mimic fasting rather than those that mimic fewer calories..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Fasting needed to see full

did you know the term is unique to Scotlandand Ireland Heres everything you need to know about the Scots term guising, how it dfers from trick or treating and other Scottish Halloween traditions.What does guising mean Guising derives from the word disguise, and is based on the notion that people dress up at Halloween.Children dress up and go from house to house, telling jokes and stories or singing songs in exchange for sweeties and food.The Collins dictionary defines guising as \"the practice orcustomofdisguisingoneself infancydress, often with amask, andvisitingpeoples houses, especially atHalloween\".According to folklore, children dressed up so they could venture out safely without wicked ghouls detecting them.Homeowners may leave pumpkins or decorations outside their houses to indicate they are welcoming guisers.Is guising dferent to trick or treating Yes, guising is dferent to trick or treating.Traditionally, guising requires you to tell a story or a joke or sing a song, while trick or treating simply requires going up to doors and calling \"trick or treat\".Treat usually refers to a sweetie or food item, while trick refers to thethreat ofa trick being played on homeownersthey dont offer a treat.What other Scottish Halloween traditions take place There are a few moreScottish Halloween traditions aside form guising.Before pumpkin carving became the done thing, Scots traditionally carved turnips instead and filled them with candles.Apple dookin is also a Scottish tradition people have to get apples out of a basin of water using just their mouths.Alternatively, people hold forks in their mouths and drop them from a distance in an attempt to stab an apple.Another tradition was especially for newly engaged couples the couple would each burn a nut on the fire andthe nuts burned quietly a happy union lay ahead, whilethey crackled and hissed there was more likely a turbulent future.A game that has been modernised is treacle scones - back in the day, people used to try to eat scones suspended with strings without using their hands.Nowadays, this game tends to be played using

forest, of course, but a very small strip of ancient woodland, east of Innerwick, that clings to the steep slopes of the glen by Crowhill. The woodland is a nature reserve currently managed by the Scottish Wildle Trust.The upper path takes you to Innerwick Castle. This path is narrow in places, although quite well trodden so easy to follow.But it is sided by a steep decline into the gorge that demands you take care when walking. The castle, built in the th century, is perched dramatically atop a sandstone outcrop looking over the glen. It is picturesque now but a crumbling ruin in such a precarious condition that itrsquos not recommended to venture inside.I wrote of its history on this page over seven years ago, and will touch on it again here, but the purpose of this visit was mainly to explore the gorge below the castle, which Irsquod never managed to do.Irsquoll give a warning here too: the lower path that takes you closer to the burn, although marked, doesnrsquot seem to be maintained and is in parts very muddy and slippery. It can become an adventure rather than a woodland walk. But thatrsquos what we wanted.We were immersed in native woodland as we descended, embraced by ash and oak trees. The burn ran with some confidence through the glen, carrying the rainfall of previous days. Touches of autumn were everywhere, yet the summer canopy was still intact. It was a perfect combination.As the path heads deeper up the glen, the trunk of a massive fallen tree make it an obstacle course, but also an opportunity to sit and just take in the beauty of the place and soak up the birdsong.In those moments, it was possible to forget that we were, in fact, in a landscape dominated by agriculture and open fields. The steep sides of the gorge hide the fact that the wood is just a very narrow strip. The eye is deceived, the imagination lit and the senses lted.I was determined to make it to the water. The short scramble down to the burn from the path was a drama of mud.I know, Irsquom not selling this place so well, am I, but it was the challenge to reach the burn that made it feel so remote and wild once we got there.Then one of my kids, in between complaining about muddy shoes, said something that lit up the day for me.ldquoWow, you know, it almost feels like we are in a world of fairytale make believe, you know because we are in a wood that feels like itrsquos mysterious and magical at the same time.She summed up my feelings as I sat by the burn, listening to the water tumble over the rocks.I really wanted to walk up the burn to the point below the castle.Wersquod earlier peered down at the burn from the base of the rock on which the castle is built at least a ft-fall, I reckoned.It was far too dangerous to descend at that point, although I had wanted to it was where a Scots soldier from the castle leapt for his le in  when the castle was besieged by English hakbutters, an early kind of musketeer.He was desperate his comrades had been picked off by the gunfire, so he took the chance to escape.Miraculously, he survived the initial fall and was allowed to run to safety. Sadly, he made the fatal decision to run upstream, towards Thornton Castle, where he was seen and shot by a dferent group of English soldiers who knew nothing of his daring feat.The incident was recorded by an English eyewitness, but we have no name for the man who met his end so tragically in this gorge ndash just another nameless victim of a brutal war that became known later as the lsquoRough Wooingrsquo.Later, the castle was used as a base by moss troopers in  in their attacks on Cromwellrsquos supply route, but thatrsquos another story.The melancholy of the glenrsquos history didnrsquot diminish its beauty for me and I made my way carefully along the burn, jumping from stone to stone, getting my boots muddy and soaked in the process.

Not to do so is to exclude iniduals who represent no more risk to the health of others than the vaccinated majority. Surely such discrimination is not acceptable in a liberal democracy The aim of the legislation should be to protect the health of those who are vulnerable and not to coerce uptake of the vaccine among the young. If this is deemed desirable the Government should be striving to achieve this through discussion, persuasion and the provision of information.Improving the scheme in this way will not assist in alleviating the problems faced by businesses and venues in having to police the passports, but it does have the advantage of paying just a little more respect to notions of fairness and freedom.W Coghlan, Neilston.SALMON INDUSTRY IN CHOPPY WATERSTAVISH Scott, CEO of the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation, begins his articlewith ldquoImagine getting a rigid-inflatable boat to work, skimming across the waves on the Sound of Mull, early morning sunlight glittering on the waves, porpoises playing in the bow wave. It made me wonderhe is looking for a career move into the Scottish Tourist Board.A more realistic intro might be: ldquoImagine enduring a choppy ride in a heavy swell on your way to spending a wet and windy day transferring dead and dying diseased salmon into a boat thatrsquos going to take them away to be buried on a nearby beach or transported a further  miles by road to a toxic waste disposal facility.Mr Scott extended his poetic licence to say ldquothe pay is pretty good with average salaries of pound,. One major company is currently looking for employees whose duties will include ldquosea lice identication and reporting. Sampling, weighing and grading of fish. Disease and parasite control. Site maintenance including net changing etc. Boat handling and stock movements. That is responsible, heavy duty work, often in dangerous conditions. The wage starts at pound. an hour, thatrsquos one penny an hour more than the real living wage and, for a -hour week, just over half that quoted by Mr Scott.He asks government to help salmon farmers by allowing them to resume bringing in workers from Eastern Europe and by building houses for those workers to live in. The first step the Scottish Government should take is to stop the expansion of the unsustainable, cruel and polluting industry of factory fish farming. Tens of millions of fish die from disease, parasite infestation and poor handling annually.It would also make sense to insist that when industries want to establish in rural areas they provide the housing and other infrastructure required by their staff and families. Too often all they do is take the money outand leave their rubbish behind.John F. Robins, For Animal Concern, Dumbarton.FOLLY OF FLATS MINDSETIN RELATION to COP , due to be hosted by Glasgow next month, the climate crisis and reducing our carbon footprint, I would like to point out an important point: many new-build flats are built without facilities outside or inside to dry laundry.Builders expect residents to use tumble dryers. These dryers use large amounts of energy, therefore they are going to cost larger amounts of money as prices rise. I spoke to someone who lives in one of these buildings, who told me that rules state that residents \"are not permitted to dry washing outside\".No wonder Extinction Rebellion activists are protesting in the way they are, in the face of such unbelievable stupidity. The idea behind it is, I suspect, that washing lines outside make the area look common. Pure snobbishness. Sort it out or Extinction Rebellion will have something to say about it.Margaret Forbes, Kilmacolm.STILL IN DARK ABOUT OUR CULTUREI havenrsquot encountered any young person who knows that William Dunbarwas a far greater poet than Burns ndash who certainly deserves more credit than Jeremy Paxton recently gave him, for his ingenious versication. Similarly, Scots of all ages continue to accept that \"Scottish music\" means the Jimmy Shand and Robert Wilson kind of thing music hall and know nothing whatsoever about the th century Scottish composers, some of whose work bears comparison with that of Palestrina or Josquin des Prez.Robin Dow, Rothesay."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-scotland-needs-rise-endless-yes-no-debate","story":"Perhaps the focus has moved on from the referendum of  when the question was ldquoShould Scotland be an independent country . Now almost nobody maintains that Scotland should be an independent country. Even although many still talk about independence it is far from clear what is meant by that usage and there is more or less unanimity that Scotland should be in a union, whether it be the UK or the EU. The word independence now appears to be more of a signal of rejection of the UK rather than of union in principle. Any debate that explores the concept of independence in the true meaning of the word is therefore irrelevant to the mainstream of current concern and unlikely to lead us out of the present political quagmire.The central question now therefore seems to ask which union would be best suited to the future, primarily of Scotland but also, as Scotland is traditionally an outward-looking nation, to the wider context of the common good. Rather than grieve the demise of the independence debate I am looking to explore the indicators as to what the future may hold in each of the unions respectively: what would be the respective prospects for peace, prosperity, internal dissension and hostilities, climate control, currency control, geopolitical and border dispute, education and cultural exchange, immigration management, civil and military use of nuclear power, public health, inidual liberty and public order and national autonomy within each union and so on.These are complex issues and many people prefer to focus on one word, Yes or No, which is akin to walking blindfold into the future and not representative of Scottish intellect.Michael Sheridan, Glasgow.DOUBLE STANDARDS ON BORDERSTHE Westminster Conservative Government, wearing its Brexiter hat, assures us that there is no need for a border across Ireland to facilitate trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic. When it switches to wearing its unionist hat it insists that border checks and delays will be unavoidable between England and an independent Scotland which rejoins the EU.Perhaps our man in Marbella will explain these contradictory positions upon his .Willie Maclean, Milngavie.PLEASE RECONSIDER FREEPORT SNUBCOULD I appeal to Nicola Sturgeon to reconsider her decision to not progress with the UK freeport model As a north-east businessman, and provider of employment opportunities for local people, I find this decision very hard to understand in the present economic climate.Instead of collaboration for the benefit of all, we have the same old response of refusing to cooperate for the desires of a few.Putting politics, and ambition for independence, over and above the well-being of our economy and employment benefits of the people seems to be the hallmark of our present Government.When will this change Graham Whitbourn, Balmedie.DANGER OF CONTROL OF CARE SERVICEMANY independence supporters working in local authorities have had their commitment undermined by the contradictory demands from the Scottish Government for both maximum devolution within the UK and maximum centralisation within Scotland.I believe in devolution as a principle. So when we could see that Westminster was staging a power grab after Brexit I was appalled. But when I saw the Scottish Governmentrsquos plans to nakedly grab power by taking all social work and social care services into the control of a huge national quango to be called the National Care Service I was even more alarmed.It would seem that in spite of the examples of how big, centrally-managed quangos do not work , the Scottish Government is set on wresting control and power not just from Westminster, but also from Scottish local authorities and local communities.It is hard to defend the Scottish Government from allegations of hypocrisy and snatching control for its own sake when it carries on like this.Such concentration of power at the centre of any country in a command and control structure is both dangerous and undemocratic and not the vision of a free Scotland so many of us hoped to see in our letimes.K Heath, Kirriemuir.REAL CONCERNS ON ASSISTED DYINGTHERE is abroad again the contentious issue of a campaign to legalise assisted dying.It is so hard for relatives to watch a loved one suffering extreme pain which even palliative medication cannot ease. One has to have sympathy for those suffering and those watching them suffering, but there is the concern that to open the door to assisted dying legally may amount to creating the conditions where assisted dying becomes a norm in much the same way that abortion is taken today as an everyday occurrence.Safeguards were supposed to have been put in place to ensure that abortion did not just become abortion on demand, which is, however, the way it looks today.The cavalier suggestion about taking a decision via a Zoom consultation with the terminally ill patientdoes not smack of a sufficient safeguard to protect the interests of that particular patient.Then there is the question of who will administer the prescribed final injection or give the last tablet or draught to help the patient pass over peacefully. If any such decision has to be made, it is vital that the doctor should be present, alone with the patient physically, to determine the patients state of mind and the path the patient wishes to take with regard to assisted dying.If the patient is determined to go ahead with ending le, then there has to be consideration as to who will administer the final draught, since there are bound to be feelings of guilt to contend with for the person or persons executing the ending of anothers le.Christianity has taught us that le is sacred and we should interfere with neither the introduction nor the ending of le.For many of faith, and not just the Christian faith, assisted dying would be a step in the wrong direction in that they would feel it opens the floodgates to what would amount to a culture of expected or enforced death for anyone struck down with any terminal condition for which medical science has not yet found a cure.To me, there is no need to strive officiously to keep alive any patient for whom there is no cure but neither is there any good reason for hastening someones end when medical science can come up with effective palliative treatments to ease the afflictions of patients in distress.I know that I could not in all conscience agree to the administration of a fatal dose nor administer such a dose to anyone trapped by a terminal condition. If the powers that be sign such a law into force, there will have to be real and genuine safeguards built into the law without any possibility of evasion of those safeguards, as sadly has happened down through the years with abortion.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.ABORTION IS NOT HEALTHCAREIF only there were more MSPs like John Mason willing to take a stand against abortion and attend pro-le vigils . I consider that the brutal and horric act of abortion is the greatest crime against humanity in our so-called enlightened and progressive age and more politicians should take a stand like Mr Mason. We say it is good to be anti-slavery good to be anti-racism and good to be anti-trafficking. I would add that it is also good to be anti-abortion.The Back off Scotland campaign continues to push the  narrative that pro-le vigils harass and intimidate vulnerable women.

As in that political satire, the swearing in Succession has been raised to an art form.Characters are brutal towards each other, but since they are all such horrible people with zip in the way of redeeming qualities we do not carethe worst happens to them. Itrsquos gladiators v gladiators out there, not lions v Christians.Just as in The Thick of It, the cast are so comfortable with each other, and the writing so slick, the drama moves like a well-oiled farce.The actors donrsquot need to fight over the juiciest lines because there are enough for everybody. Where other comedy-dramas might have a miserly handful of zingers, the multiple Emmy-winning Succession throws them around like confetti.In an ensemble as good as this, it should be dficult to choose a favourite, but who are we ******* kidding here  Brian Coxrsquos swearmaster-in-chief commands every scene he is in.Logan, one of the most fascinating TV characters in years, is a charming psychopath who long ago wearied of the charming part of the deal.He is, as cousin Greg likes to say, ldquoall killer, no filler, a man who has clawed his way out of poverty in Scotland , a modern day robber baron who thinks tough love is the only kind that will equip his children to survive in this rotten world .Courtesy of Cox, Logan can make Daniel Day-Lewisrsquos oilman in There Will Be Blood look like Santa.The third series opener could have been a stop-start affair aiming to pick up new viewers who have heard the buzz about Succession and fancy seeing what the fuss is about.That Armstrong gives it the pace of a runaway train is a promising sign that he is not short of ideas about where to take the story and is in a hurry to get there. Dare we hope there could be a fourth series Meanwhile, Cox is clearly having a ball with raging bull Logan and yes, Succession still has the classiest score in town.Cue the piano ...Sky Atlantic, pm tonight"},{"url":null,"title":"celebrity-2021-ant-dec-react-itv-reveal-years-line-up","story":"Ant and Dec who host the hit show were left open mouthed by the celebrity line-up but fans of the show will have to wait a little longer to see it for themselves.An lsquoIrsquom A Celeb Cast Revealrsquo video was shared on the Geordie duorsquos social media channels with the identity of the celebrities still hidden for viewers.However,Ant and Decrsquos reactions are anything to go by, fans of the show are in for a treat.The first celebrity drew applause and cheering and applause from the hosts as they said: We love him, very, very good.The duo become more and more surprised as each celebrity is revealed leaving Decrsquos mouth wide open as he gasps: ldquoThatrsquos amazing!Ant adds: ldquoTheyrsquore really good!Bring.

I thought it might be fitting for the bell to be recommissioned and used again in remembrance of the  lives lost.”Towards the end of , Bill contacted a local craftsman and friend, Richard Wilson, and askedhe could help. It had been hoped to have the clapper made and fitted ready for the anniversary in , however plans had to be delayed due to the pandemic.In the meantime, Richard carried out online research and was eventually able to get inside the Cathedral to measure up, acquiring the bronze for the clapper proved dficult locally so he had to source it online.“It took me around a fortnight to make the clapper in my shed at home mostly using a hobby lathe and a CNC router,# said Richard.#I was a bit taken aback when Bill asked me to do this for him. Obviously, it is a great honour and a privilege for me to be asked considering the history of the ship and the lives lost during the sinking.#Hopefully this clapper will be around for years to come and will be used to commemorate the event each year.”However, this was only half the tale. The clapper needed a tassel — a rope that someone would actually hold to ring the bell.Fran Hollinrake is the visitor services officer and custodian at the cathedral.She said that, having attended several commemorations over the years, her and her husband Andy became friendly with a couple, John and Tracy Welch.John’s father, Stoker Petty Officer John Welch, was on board HMS Royal Oak the night she sank, but he survived.His son, John, was a rigger in the Tyneside dockyards, and spent much of his working le working with ropes, but ill-health prevented John from making the tassel.Instead he passed the job on to his former apprentice and friend Paul New.John and his we Tracy arrived in Orkney this week and were present at the unveiling.John said of his father#s experience on that fateful night: #The night of the sinking he was on deck having a cigarette when the explosion happened. He managed to get off the ship and into the water and was picked up by the Daisy II.#He said he had held on to another chap in the water who was in dficulty,  as he was an excellent swimmer and had medals for le saving and water polo, but when they were both pulled aboard by the crew of the Daisy unfortunately the other chap had died. He was lucky to escape with burns to his hands and face.#After medical attention I think a week or so later he was sent back to Portsmouth to join another ship.“As I far as I can remember he never ed to Orkney, but after the war attended the reunions in Portsmouth on a regular basis. As for his feelings about that night it wasn’t something he went into in great detail, but he did say thathe could get back on the ship he would know exactly where his gold lighter and cigarette case were.#Representing the council, who maintain the Cathedral on behalf of the people of Orkney, Councillor Stephen Clackson also has a personal connection to the Royal Oak, having tragically lost his uncle Ronald George Clackson when the ship went down.He said: “My Uncle Ronny was the closest sibling in age to my dad and his favourite brother. He was very technically minded and joined the Royal Navy on July , , aged ¾, for ‘  ’ years.#After training at the shore establishment HMS Victory, he was posted to the recommissioned HMS Royal Oak as an ordinary seaman on June , , when the ship was expected to be embarking on a -month tour of the Mediterranean.#Looming hostilities set the course of the battleship in another direction, and by August she was in Scapa Flow. My uncle was reported missing presumed killed when the Royal Oak was sunk by torpedoes from the U- in the early hours of October , just a week after his th birthday.#The news was devastating for my grandmother, whose brother had been killed on the Somme in World War I at the same age, and she never really got over it.

Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4156276.jpg--.jpg?1634197334000\n","title":"st vincent de paul member roadshow visits ballymena","story":"THE Society of St Vincent de Paul has hosted a series of Member Roadshows, visiting towns and cities across the province, to engage with members in person for the first time since March last year.As well as providing representatives of more than , members from  SVP Conferences across Northern Ireland with an overview of the Society and how it has responded to the tens of thousands who have needed its support most in the past  months.

Mary Waide, Regional President of SVP North Region, said: “I am absolutely delighted with the success of this series of SVP Member Roadshows and the feedback from those who were able to attend.It was important for the SVP regional board to get out into our local communities having had such a long time apart from our members face to face. The focus of the roadshows were to primarily express our gratitude to our members for the sterling work they have been continuing to do on the ground to help those who have needed it most, during the most trying of times, and to share with them our SVP vision for the longer term. “The dedication of members of SVP has never been more important than it has been in the past  months. I know from experience how daunting it has been trying to help the vulnerable in our community without compromising or risking the health of those who are supporting those in need. As we move forward, it is my hope that our Conferences in County Antrim continue to go from strength to strength under the guidance of Frederic Ozanam who founded SVP almost  years ago.”SVP is an international charity and the largest voluntary charity in Ireland. SVP members in Northern Ireland work in all communities to support people whatever their background, who are experiencing poverty and social exclusion, promoting self-sufficiency and working for social justice. Every year SVP spends approximately pound million to help those experiencing poverty in Northern Ireland. Last year, SVP responded to tens of thousands of calls for assistance from members of the public.

For example, someone could own property in Northern Ireland via a chain of other companies based in ious countries. These countries are frequently tax havens, such as the British Virgin Islands and Switzerland.The leak revealed scores of these schemes, including how the Qatari ruling family avoided paying £.m in tax on a mansion in London and the leading family of Azerbaijan#s secret involvement in UK property deals worth more than £m.It has now emerged that the NI Land Registry has been working with the Department for Business, Energy  Industrial Strategy in GB to introduce measures that will provide more transparency when foreign entities  register property here.People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said the Pandora Papers have publicly exposed what everybody has known for years - the wealthy will go to anyto hide their assets in order to avoid paying their fair share.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The rules apply to everybody  except those with deep pockets, he said.Successive Stormont Executives have sent a message continually that major corporations should have their taxes reduced in the fancul belief that wealth would trickle down, which it never does.Ministers in the Executive need to ensure that a zero-tolerance approach to tax evasion and fraud, and globally there is somewhere between . trillion to  trillion stashed in accounts, third-party companies and other complex arrangements.So, I hope the focus now shts away from ‘benefit fraud’ and attention turns to the real fraudsters in society - which is those who have millions and billions in their banks accounts but refuse to be subject to the same rules as the rest of us.SDLP MLA Justin McNulty added: “It’s welcome that the Land Registry are working to introduce new measures to ensure there will be more transparency around this issue, but we also need to see the British Government deliver on its long-promised legislation to name those who buy property through foreign companies.Finance Minister Conor Murphy should ensure that a register of foreign companies who own land in the North is maintained via the information held by Land and Property Services.“The Pandora Papers have shown the need for greater transparency around these issues at all levels of our society. The wealthy should not feel they can use the North as their play-thing to hide wealth, avoid tax, and engage in money laundering – we need to see immediate action to address these concerns.”On the Pandora Papers leak, Fergus Shiel, of the ICIJ, said:  There#s never been anything on this scale and it shows the reality of what offshore companies can offer to help people hide cash or avoid tax.They are using those offshore accounts, those offshore trusts, to buy hundreds of millions of dollars of property in other countries, and to enrich their own families, at the expense of their citizens..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsGerry CarrollDepartment of Finance Conor MurphyMore On Gerry Carroll PremiumClose to , NI Civil Service agency staff still waiting for pay rise announced last year PremiumCall to strip Capita of benefit payments role after firm fined £.m for failings PremiumFrustration as  requests for NDNA language discussion at Executive denied PremiumNo plans to introduce ‘right to disconnect’ legislation in Northern IreIand, says Economy Minister Gordon Lyons PremiumPIP firm Capita paid £m more than previously admittedMost ReadCocaine kingpin Noel Johnston plunged to death during police raid on Ballymena flatNorth Belfast woman still holds UK’s youngest gran titleJohn LavertyOpinionDrug dealer Noel Johnston was the hardest of hard men in a dangerous town... and he was only a teenager at the timeFamily left devastated after electrician Adam Newell killed following work-related accidentNI petrol station halts unleaded sales after ‘contamination’ reportsTop VideosPlayFuneral held for Chieftains founder Paddy MoloneyPlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVFPlayKatrina Rainey Knockloughrim killing: Mancharged with murder of womanLatest Northern IrelandPolice launch murder probe after body found in Co LondonderryDUP north-south boycott is ‘cutting off nose to spite face’Cost of shared education campus rises from £m in  to £mNI man part of expedition to Titanic’s sister ship Britannic illustrated in new bookMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageLatest‘Stranded’ cygnets rescued by railway workersCzech president unable to carry out duties because of health issuesPolice failed to flag up ‘signicant’ incident involving serial killerLeicester boss Steve Borthwick hails ‘phenomenal’ George Ford after England snubCovid certicates and masks likely to remain in place after Friday,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, congratulated the staff at the park for the retention of the status. “Brooke Park is a real gem in the heart of the city and it has been maintained resplendently over the last five years for everyone to enjoy,” he said. “During the lockdown restrictions it was a place where people could visit to relax and enjoy the outdoors and children enjoyed the state of the art play facilities in a safe environment.     “Congratulations to council’s parks team for all their hard work in ensuring the park met the criteria for the Green Flag which I’m sure will highlight the park’s offering to new visitors this year.” Rachel Vaughan, who manages the Green Flag Awards programme, said she hoped people would use the awards as an incentive to visit some new places in one of the most beautul seasons of the year. “We all love a walk through the autumn leaves and it’s uplting to discover a new spot to enjoy,” she said. “When you visit a Green Flag park or open space you can be reassured that the location is being managed to a really high standard as they’ve been through a rigorous judging process that assesses sites across a range of issues including their horticultural standards, cleanliness, bioersity and safety. “At a time when many people’s finances are under pressure, it’s important to highlight the fact that all Green Flag spaces are free to everyone.” Parks and open spaces play a hugely important role in supporting the health and wellbeing of local communities and come in many shapes and sizes. The expert judges, who are all volunteers themselves, were delighted to include several community spaces in this year’s selection, which are also run and managed by volunteers at a local level. These include: Shellinghill Park and Millennium Path, Sentry Hill Community Garden, Footprints Women’s Centre, Rathfern Activity Centre, Toome Linear Walk and Ballyeaston Church Ruin. Special Green Flag Heritage Awards were presented to Stormont Estate, Brooke Park, Sentry Hill Historic House and Visitor Centre, Antrim Castle Gardens and Clotworthy House, Queen’s University Belfast, Warrenpoint Municipal Park, Newry Canal and Belfast Botanic Gardens.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Columba is a figure as multi-faceted as his names are numerous, be it Columba, Colmcille or Columb. googletag.cmd.push This year marks the ,th anniversary of the birth of one of the patron saints of the island. Columba, who was a prolic founder of monasteries, is credited with founding the city of Derry upon the rocks that mark where Long Tower Church stands today. However, Columba was not merely a meek monastery founder but someone who exhibited the courage of his convictions in stories as wide ranging as confronting Pictish tribes in modern-day Scotland to immersing himself in transcription and the reproduction of manuscripts. With Columba as its patron, St. Columb’s College will stage a year of celebration in honour of the momentous anniversary of Columba’s birth.     A Mass, celebrated by Bishop McKeown, on June  this year marked the start of this year of celebration that will culminate on June  next year.. The celebrations will entail the celebrating of Columba in his totality from Columba the scholar to Columba the seafarer to Columba the warrior, to name but a few. St. Columb’s College is inviting members of the public to its inaugural event on Friday, October  next at :pm in St. Eugene’s Cathedral Church Hall, Infirmary Road.  Dr Stephen Kelly.  Nathan Thiruvengadam, from the Colleges Columba Committee, said: “We are delighted to announce that Dr Stephen Kelly, past pupil and recipient of the Queen’s University Student Union Award for most iInspir- ing motivating teacher in both  and in , will be delivering a talk titled: Calves and Kindles: St Columba and the History of the Book. “Dr. Kelly, who is the author of the upcoming Imagining History in Medieval Britain, as well as co-editor of Betwixt and Between: Place and Cultural Translationand Imagining the Book , will walk us through the questions: Can it be true that St. Columba left Ireland over a book  Why was the act of copying St Finnian’s Psalter such an affront  What was a Psalter anyway, and how did it come to represent such a powerful instrument of cultural prestige and political authority  The talk will situate the Cathach of St Columba within the context of late classical and medieval ‘book culture.’ It will argue that the book is the most signicant technological innovation in Western culture, while also suggesting that the book and its metaphors continue, even in a digital age, to shape profoundly our under- standing of memory, history – and ourselves.” “The event is open to all be you young or old an expert or a novice on the background of our city’s founder- all are welcome. “The event is free but email columba@ stcolumbscollege.org to con- firm your attendance. “Tea and refreshments will be provided after the talk.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Local climate and environmental campaigners recently formed a Derry North West COP Climate Action organising hub geared towards organising actions on the thNovember and during the two week UN conference. googletag.cmd.push Representatives from the Derry North West COP Climate Action said: ‘So far governments have done too little, too late, colluding with corporations and continuing the exploitation of workers and the planet. We urge everyone who understands the threat posed by climate change to join protests because it is only through the mass mobilisation that we can build the kind of pressure needed for urgent, radical and systemic action to address the climate crisis.’ At September’s full meeting, Derry and Strabane Council backed People Before Profit Councillor Maeve O’Neills motion calling for support for the th of November Global Day of Actionin Derry and across these islands.     Cllr ONeill said, ‘The decisions made at COP will shape how governments respond, or not, to the climate crisis. Westminster, the Stormont Executive and the Daacuteil governments have failed to take the urgent and radical action needed. People power is the key to forcing decision makers away fromGovernment’sdo-nothing systemicapproach,focusing only on inidual actions. Thesystemicchange needed to avert catastrophic climate change actually has the potential to improve the quality of le for the vast majority of people on the planet.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The Helicopter Emergency Medical Servicerecently reported that July this year broke the record as its busiest month, with team being called out  times - three of which were in the Derry City and Strabane District Council area - and clocking up  flying hours in total. googletag.cmd.push The service, which aims to save lives, brains and limbs, has been tasked to the Derry City and Strabane District Council area  times from its inception in July  to August this year. The charity held its second abseil at the Tower Museum on the September  which saw  local people conquering the  foot drop on one of the city’s most iconic buildings. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Graham Warke, attended the event to show his support for Air Ambulance NI. Participating in the abseil were two members from the local Chamber of Commerce Paul Clancy, chief executive, and Aidan O’Kane, Allstate NI director.     Abseiling alongside them were Karen McQuillan, finance director at Find Insurance, the main sponsors of this year’s Chamber dinner which Chamber president Dawn McLaughlin has chosen will benefit Air Ambulance NI.  Dawn McLaughlin, president of Derry Chamber of Commerce, with participants who took part in the abseil of the Tower Museum in aid of the Air Ambulance.  Also partaking in the adrenaline fuelling challenge was Caroline Doyle who is a member of the AANI agribusiness group and agricultural business manager for Barclays who are match-funding Caroline’s donations. City of Derry Young Farmers Club celebrated their th anniversary this year and decided to mark the milestone by raising funds for Air Ambulance NI in memory of member Gordon Crocketts father, David, who sadly lost his le last year in a farming accident. The young farmers sourced a -year-old Fendt tractor and used it duringa -hour plough at a family fun day in Eglinton in September last, the event raising over pound, for the charity. Also, Foyle Food Group brought the agribusiness together at a barbecue. Karen Kelso, group commercial director said: “It was lovely to be able to host this event both in recognition of the company milestone and to raise vital funds for the air ambulance given the downturn in fundraising through the pandemic. We were bowled over by the support of our farmers to the charity – we had  attendees on the evening and hundreds more bought tickets knowing they couldn’t attend simply to support this incredible lesaving service. “We would like to extend thanks to our almost  sponsors, all who supported the night and those who attended. Music from Richie Remo and Hugo Duncan was enjoyed by all. Foyle Food Group have raised a staggering pound, for the Air Ambulance NI charity.” However, the community support hasn’t stopped there. As well as these two events, shoppers at local Marks  Spencer’s in Foyleside Shopping Centre have been donating through in-store collection boxes during the health pandemic. Kerry Anderson, head of fundraising, said, “We want to send this special message of thanks to our supporters across Derry to let them know how much their support means to us.

The Helicopter Emergency Medical Servicerecently reported that July this year broke the record as its busiest month, with team being called out  times - three of which were in the Derry City and Strabane District Council area - and clocking up  flying hours in total. googletag.cmd.push The service, which aims to save lives, brains and limbs, has been tasked to the Derry City and Strabane District Council area  times from its inception in July  to August this year. The charity held its second abseil at the Tower Museum on the September  which saw  local people conquering the  foot drop on one of the city’s most iconic buildings. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Graham Warke, attended the event to show his support for Air Ambulance NI. Participating in the abseil were two members from the local Chamber of Commerce Paul Clancy, chief executive, and Aidan O’Kane, Allstate NI director.     Abseiling alongside them were Karen McQuillan, finance director at Find Insurance, the main sponsors of this year’s Chamber dinner which Chamber president Dawn McLaughlin has chosen will benefit Air Ambulance NI.  Dawn McLaughlin, president of Derry Chamber of Commerce, with participants who took part in the abseil of the Tower Museum in aid of the Air Ambulance.  Also partaking in the adrenaline fuelling challenge was Caroline Doyle who is a member of the AANI agribusiness group and agricultural business manager for Barclays who are match-funding Caroline’s donations. City of Derry Young Farmers Club celebrated their th anniversary this year and decided to mark the milestone by raising funds for Air Ambulance NI in memory of member Gordon Crocketts father, David, who sadly lost his le last year in a farming accident. The young farmers sourced a -year-old Fendt tractor and used it duringa -hour plough at a family fun day in Eglinton in September last, the event raising over pound, for the charity. Also, Foyle Food Group brought the agribusiness together at a barbecue. Karen Kelso, group commercial director said: “It was lovely to be able to host this event both in recognition of the company milestone and to raise vital funds for the air ambulance given the downturn in fundraising through the pandemic. We were bowled over by the support of our farmers to the charity – we had  attendees on the evening and hundreds more bought tickets knowing they couldn’t attend simply to support this incredible lesaving service. “We would like to extend thanks to our almost  sponsors, all who supported the night and those who attended. Music from Richie Remo and Hugo Duncan was enjoyed by all. Foyle Food Group have raised a staggering pound, for the Air Ambulance NI charity.” However, the community support hasn’t stopped there. As well as these two events, shoppers at local Marks  Spencer’s in Foyleside Shopping Centre have been donating through in-store collection boxes during the health pandemic. Kerry Anderson, head of fundraising, said, “We want to send this special message of thanks to our supporters across Derry to let them know how much their support means to us. Quite literally the service would be grounded without you. This has been the busiest summer to date for the service which costs pound, every single day to maintain. “Although this service forms a vital part of the frontline emergency services in Northern Ireland, our lesaving missions need kind and generous support just like the community efforts we have witnessed recently throughout the city. The Air Ambulance NI volunteers and supporters are like no other, and we are immensely proud to have them as part of the service.”  Derry Chamber of Commerce members abseil from Tower Museum peak for ambulance charity     Top cop highly frustrated with response by public to Lyra McKee murder appeal  Huge frustration at the lack of eye-witnesses who have come forward    Derry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale  Local court told case complicated and unusual   ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The Sky Blues slumped to a second consecutive defeat at the hands of Newry City – despite having taken the lead. Benny McLaughlin gave Stute an early lead at the Brandywell but an equaliser from Stephen Lawless and James Teelans strike on the hour gave Newry the points. googletag.cmd.push While Donaghey could not fault his troops for work-rate, a lack of quality has caused enough concern for him to seek new blood to bolster his squad. He said: “Without revealing too much, Ive ten players in mind who Id like to bring to the team. “It would be great to get all of them but it could very well work out that I go for ten and end up being able to bring in three on that list. “We will have to see. By Christmas, that list could potentially rise to twenty but, I will be trying to get new faces in to add to our numbers.     “Ive not yet entered into any talks with most of them as they are still under contract at their own clubs. Those who are at amateur level I have had a chat with. Again we will have to wait and see. “With the squad that I have right now, the work-rate is there but we are just missing that bit of quality that can convert that work-rate into points and get us higher up the league. “We not only need to create more chances but we have to take them too. A good side like Newry showed that last week. “Im also looking to see where the leaders in our squad are and for them to step up. It doesnt help when you have injuries to key players but you still have to show some leadership out there. “Newry are the best team weve played so far but some of our players need to grow up very quickly. “I knew what I was getting into when I arrived here but it seems we do need to strengthen the squad which is what Ill be trying to do.” Institute currently lie third from bottom in the NIFL Championship and face a tricky-trip to promotion-chasing Ballyclare Comrades on Saturday. Comrades flexed their muscles ahead of Institutes visit with a - win at fourth in the table, Annagh United. Donaghey added: “Ballyclare are a very progressive club with lots of experience in their squad. “However,we can step up and add the quality needed to go with our work-rate, we can hopefully get something.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

McCarter watched his side put in a sterling performance down at Cork as they headed back up north with a - win at Sundays Well. googletag.cmd.push Alex McDonnell led the way with a try, a penalty and two conversions with Paddy Blennerhasset also crossing over. It has been a slow start to the season for City of Derry but as McCarter says, this victory was hard-earned and well-deserved. He said: “It was a good one to get – a great performance and, thank God, a good one to get over the line. “Its a bit of a monkey of our back now. To be honest, whenever youre not winning its dficult at times. “We havent had much luck in terms of injuries and players not being available.     “Even on the morning of the game, one of the players – David Lapsley – woke up feeling very unwell. “He didnt even make it out of the hotel and with everything  thats gone before, youre starting to think that the rugby Gods just dont want us to win another game. “David just woke and felt unwell. His balance wasnt great so we just kept him in the hotel room. We were down a man before we had already started. “We got him back on the bus after the game and hopefully he will be better over the next few days. “As for the game itself, we knew it was important to get a good start – which we did. But within two minutes we were back at seven-all. “That was frustrating because we had started well for the first time in a while. We were definitely the better team up to that point and it was frustrating to give away a cheap score. “We picked ourselves back up again and got a penalty to take the lead going into half-time. We had been playing into a breeze the opening forty minutes so we had negotiated the conditions pretty well. “We had a big forty minutes to put in for the second half and showed good discipline in forcing Sundays Well to give away a lot of penalties. “We put the pressure on them and forced them into a lot of knock-ons. Adam Marley was very effective as he forced three or four turnovers. We never allowed them to gain any momentum. “Then Alex scored a special inidual try – it came at an important time as well. Alex has the ability to create something out of nothing and he did that with a nice chip over the top which he finished well. “Sundays Well came back into it but I felt we could hold on. Looking back, the last five minutes were more comfortable than they were at the time.” The win takes City of Derry to fth spot in the All-Ireland Division c. However, having got the winning feeling, they now have to wait nearly two weeks before their next game at home to Bangor on October . McCarter added: “I suppose you could say its frustrating not to be playing the week after having got a win but we look at it as having an extra week to get those players who are injured more time to recover. Especially when weve a tough match in Bangor coming up next.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

McCarter watched his side put in a sterling performance down at Cork as they headed back up north with a - win at Sundays Well. googletag.cmd.push Alex McDonnell led the way with a try, a penalty and two conversions with Paddy Blennerhasset also crossing over. It has been a slow start to the season for City of Derry but as McCarter says, this victory was hard-earned and well-deserved. He said: “It was a good one to get – a great performance and, thank God, a good one to get over the line. “Its a bit of a monkey of our back now. To be honest, whenever youre not winning its dficult at times. “We havent had much luck in terms of injuries and players not being available.     “Even on the morning of the game, one of the players – David Lapsley – woke up feeling very unwell. “He didnt even make it out of the hotel and with everything  thats gone before, youre starting to think that the rugby Gods just dont want us to win another game. “David just woke and felt unwell. His balance wasnt great so we just kept him in the hotel room. We were down a man before we had already started. “We got him back on the bus after the game and hopefully he will be better over the next few days. “As for the game itself, we knew it was important to get a good start – which we did. But within two minutes we were back at seven-all. “That was frustrating because we had started well for the first time in a while. We were definitely the better team up to that point and it was frustrating to give away a cheap score. “We picked ourselves back up again and got a penalty to take the lead going into half-time. We had been playing into a breeze the opening forty minutes so we had negotiated the conditions pretty well. “We had a big forty minutes to put in for the second half and showed good discipline in forcing Sundays Well to give away a lot of penalties. “We put the pressure on them and forced them into a lot of knock-ons. Adam Marley was very effective as he forced three or four turnovers. We never allowed them to gain any momentum. “Then Alex scored a special inidual try – it came at an important time as well. Alex has the ability to create something out of nothing and he did that with a nice chip over the top which he finished well. “Sundays Well came back into it but I felt we could hold on. Looking back, the last five minutes were more comfortable than they were at the time.” The win takes City of Derry to fth spot in the All-Ireland Division c. However, having got the winning feeling, they now have to wait nearly two weeks before their next game at home to Bangor on October . McCarter added: “I suppose you could say its frustrating not to be playing the week after having got a win but we look at it as having an extra week to get those players who are injured more time to recover. Especially when weve a tough match in Bangor coming up next.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm.     When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Tel     Facebook Talking To Our Babies   www.shantallow.net  I was chatting with my niece and talking about last weeks article which was all about congratulations and the great things about being pregnant. googletag.cmd.push She said it made her smile and laugh but also that throughout her pregnancy she went from total joy to worry, worries about everything, all in the space of one day or even over a few minutes! So this week I thought I’d write a little bit about some of the worries you may have, to try to help you worry less… Worry one I think the main one is to stop worrying, it isn’t good for you, isn’t good for baby! Try to find a solution to that worry, find a way to ‘solve it’ and then ‘stop’ - think I’ve dealt with that so it’s a worry no more!     Worry two Baby development, of course you’ll be thinking every day how’s my baby growing, is she or he okay. The best advice here is go for your scans, look at your scan photo for reassurance, have extra scansthey make you feel reassured, talk to your midwe and follow her advice about diet, exercise, sleep etc AND relax! Worry three Giving birth - well baby is going to come out regardless of whether you worry so stop! You can though, plan what type of birth you would like, what pain relief you would like, what music you would like to listen to etc. But do also remember that he or she may decide to come early, that you can change your mind about pain relief and that as long as she or he arrives safely and you are both well that’s all that matters. Worry four Home or hospital - my niece wanted a water birth at home, till we found out about all the fuss with hose pipes, tap attachments, emptying the pool etc etc - so think carefully about what is best for you, your home, and your purse  Think, decide, be willing to change your mindbaby or you needs to and stop worrying, after all in the grand scheme of things as long as she or her arrives safely does it really matter! Worry five Germs, we’ve all had a really worrying year with the corona virus and it has made us all a bit overly conscious about germs. So being pregnant can amply this worry, but remember Mums have been pregnant for years, baby is protected in you and as long as your home is clean enough that’s all that matters. This means you do not have to clean everywhere every day! If you can, try to feed baby yourself at least for the first few days, evenyou express into a bottle, as this will help her immunity too. Worry six One of the biggest worries my niece had was who to have with her when it was time for baby to arrive. Of course she wanted baby’s dad there but then both their Mums, her Nan, her two Sisters and her Step Mum also wanted to be there, and all of them were asking consistently, giving so many reasons about why it should be them. I know my niece was completely stressed about this, I did feel like saying forget them just have me but of course I didn’t! I just said, just have Dad, tell everyone that this is what you want, just say no but thank you. Butthe time comes and you feel like you need one of them, for whatever reason decide then and there, not now, not today - but don’t tell them this otherwise it’s back to the me, me me, me please! Worry seven Telling your other child, don’t tell him or her too soon otherwise you will be tormented for nine months! Do explain that baby won’t be able to play - new siblings think ‘yes someone to play with’ and can be so disappointed when they realise baby can’t! Worry eight Feeding, there is a lot of pressure on new Mum’s to breast feed, but less information that says it’s okayyou can’t,it hurts too much, that you can’t because of the mediation you are taking,you aren’t producing enough milk etc. So from me, who experienced all this pressure and knows how harder it made it,you can’t don’t worry, just remember formula was designed for babies, enjoy feeding time, the snuggled up together, the closeness, after all that’s what matters the most! Worry nine The dog, the cat … of course you can’t get rid of Rover the dog, or Whiskers the cat, but you can adapt your home to help them prepare. Maybe they won’t be allowed on the couch or in the bedroom any more, maybe Rover will have to have two short walks a day instead of one long one, maybe you will buy a cat net for the pram or Moses basket, maybe you will buy a few new special toys for Rover for when you bring baby home. Just remember Rover and Whiskers will be curious, don’t leave them alone together for a while, don’t ignore them or this may cause jealousy after all before baby came did you not treat them like your baby! And remember millions of homes have babies and pets so providing you introduce them carefully and still give them lots of love there is no reason that won’t be your home either! Worry ten Worrying too much … yes you are so stop!ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

When asked to bring the occupants to the door, the woman disappeared inside the house, and moments later, the defendant came to the door and spoke to police. Prosecution said Coulter had presented as being intoxicated and argumentative with police, and was issued with a fixed penalty notice under the legislation. Defence for Coulter said he was among a number of people in the house who received fixed penalty notices and that it was unfortunate he didnt react more positively.     They said a group of young people had been invited to the house, and that the defendant had given into temptation and attended the gathering.

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy.     “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Rhonda McKean, , had a bout of painful sciatica that made it dficult to walk. Using a rollator frame, she took a fall and was told by her Doctors surgery, Oakleaf Medical Practice, to make her way to Altnagelvin. googletag.cmd.push However, a nine-hour wait in pain followed that didnt even result in Mrs McKean being seen that day. As a result, she had to make ajourney where she was eventually X-rayed. She said: “Six weeks ago, I had sciatica and during the night, it became so uncomfortable that it wouldnt let me walk. “I had a rollator in the house and I thought Id use that because theres no way that I would be able to get about. “Unfortunately, I managed to fall hard on to the ground and I knew that I hurt my back. “I rang the doctors surgery and was told Id get a call back from the doctor. Instead, I get a call back from the physiotherapist.     “He told me to come overso I struggled over and he told me I needed to go to Altnagelvin Hospital for an X-ray on my hip because he thought I had fractured that. “I told him that I definitely hadnt fractured my hip but had hurt my back. The X-ray showed that I hadnt broken my hip. “I went back to the surgery and the physio went to get the doctor who came back and told me that the physio wanted me to go to Altnagelvin because he thinks youve had a stroke. “I then get to Altnagelvin where I sat in the waiting area at casualty for nine hours. “I had been sent to get a brain scan but they wouldnt do one because they said I didnt have a stroke. “But during all that time, I was in pure agony as having been sitting in AE for nine hours. My back was broke but the doctors hadnt told me as they hadnt read the report in the bone scan. “I later had an X-ray and was told I had an L lumber fracture. I then had a further MRI scan.” Unfortunately, that scan would bring bad news for Mrs McKean which was compounded by it being given not by her GP at Oakfield Medical Practice, but by the receptionist. Mrs McKean added: “Last Friday , I got a letter to go to X-ray for an ultrasound on my thyroid. “I phoned up the surgery to speak to my GP to ask why I have been requested to go for an ultrasound to my thyroid. “The girl on reception put me on hold and then came back to tell me, the MRI scan showed a growth on your thyroid. “The receptionist told me that and the doctor himself couldnt even let me know. He didnt even have the decency to phone me and tell me this was happening. Yet its left to a receptionist to tell me point-blankely because theywont let me speak to a doctor.” Regarding Mrs McKeans nine-hour wait at Altnagelvin, a spokesperson for the Western Health and Social Care Trust said: “Due to patient client confidentiality we would not be responding to inidual cases. “If a patient client or their relative has any issue in relation to their treatment or the service they have received, we would encourage them to raise these issues through the Trusts comments and complaints system - the Patients Advocate Office. “The Patients Advocate Office can be contacted on . All complaints received are investigated promptly and a response issued to the person.” And in relation to how Oakfield Medical Practice broke the news to Mrs McKean of her thyroid growth diagnosis, a spokesperson for the Health and Social Care Board added: “It would not be appropriate to discuss issues in relation to inidual patients. “The patient should raise her concerns with the practice in the first instance andnot satisfied following that can approach the Health and Social Care Board through the complaints process. “If the complaint cannot be resolved through the HSC Complaints Procedure the patient can approach the NI Public Services Ombudsman.”  Defendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told  Thomas Rainey was remanded in custody until November .

Ms McLaughlin vacates her role as Economy Spokesperson to take up the position as as chair of the Assemblys Committee for the Executive Office as well as being the SDLPs spokesperson on Covid Recovery. googletag.cmd.push The reshuffle also sees a move for East Derry MLA, Cara Hunter. She moves from the position of Mental Health Spokesperson to the role of Climate Champion. Cara will also sit on the Infrastructure Committee. Ms McLaughlins fellow Foyle MLA, Mark H Durkan, remains in his post as Communities  Culture Spokesperson. Foyle MP Mr Eastwood insisted that the shakeup of the party’s spokespeople is about holding Ministers to account and delivering better outcomes for people across the north of Ireland. He said: “The SDLP has the most energetic and effective front bench teams of any party in the Assembly. “The changes I have announced today will build on the work we have been doing over the last two years to change the lives of the people we represent.     “At a moment when others are retreating to the politics of boycott, ision and deadlock, the SDLP team is committed to breaking down barriers and delivering on the priorities of people in all of our communities. “That means managing the Covid- recovery, addressing the climate crisis and driving forward a prosperity agenda. “As part of these changes I have created new roles that reflect urgent political priorities.  “Sinead McLaughlin MLA will take on an ambitious new portfolio focussed on Covid recovery. Given the cross-cutting nature of this brief I have appointed Sinead as Chair of the Executive Office Committee where she will hold the First Ministers to account for the abject failure to produce a robust strategy to transform our society. “I have also appointed Cara Hunter MLA as the SDLP Climate Champion, reflecting the urgent need to address the crisis of global temperature increases and the impact it will have on a whole generation of people. “The consequences of inaction are severe and the SDLP is bringing tough legislative proposals at Stormont and Westminster that will address the crisis. Cara will also take on a new portfolio focussed on the ambitions and needs of a new generation of young people. “The SDLP team is full of ambitious and talented public representatives who have the energy and the ideas to transform our society. Applying their skills and experience to their new roles, I know that they’ll deliver for the people we represent.” Reacting to her new role on Twitter, Sinead McLaughlin said: “My new role starts this week as chair of the Assemblys Committee for the Executive Office, where I will be holding the joint first ministers to account, leading the SDLPs work on Covid recovery and demanding that Derry is treated with the justice and equality my city deserves.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.         Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.         The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.         Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps.     Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Oct Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  St. Patrick’s Athletic  Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe’s second half header was enough to earn Derry City their first win over St. Patrick’s Athletic at the fourth attempt this season. The striker struck midway through the second half to earn a big three points for the Candystripes in a dramatic encounter which saw both teams finish with  men. googletag.cmd.push Pat’s were on top for most of the game up until Junior’s goal, missing a series of chances in the first half alone. The visitors started the game on the front foot and almost got their reward when Sam Bone’s cross found Matty Smith, and his header beat Nathan Gartside but came back off the post. Matty Smith then missed when one on one with Gartside, before Chris Forrester hit the crossbar. It was City though who took the lead on  minutes. There seemed little on when substitute Jack Malone’s pass sent Jamie McGonigle racing down the right, but the striker produced a sensational cross right into the heart of the area for Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, who simply had to nod City into a lead they had not been threatening.     The game exploded into drama on  minutes when Ronan Coughlan, on the pitch just  minutes, was red carded for elbowing Ciaran Coll. Danny Lafferty, already on a yellow card, was also sent off for his part in the melee which followed the elbow, with both team playing the final five minutes down to  men. Pat’s, still searching for an equaliser, came so close to a goal in the aftermath, but were denied by a brilliant double save from Gartside, who parried Matty Smith’s shot and then reacted to save from Benson as Derry survived again.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Oct Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  St. Patrick’s Athletic  Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe’s second half header was enough to earn Derry City their first win over St. Patrick’s Athletic at the fourth attempt this season. The striker struck midway through the second half to earn a big three points for the Candystripes in a dramatic encounter which saw both teams finish with  men. googletag.cmd.push Pat’s were on top for most of the game up until Junior’s goal, missing a series of chances in the first half alone. The visitors started the game on the front foot and almost got their reward when Sam Bone’s cross found Matty Smith, and his header beat Nathan Gartside but came back off the post. Matty Smith then missed when one on one with Gartside, before Chris Forrester hit the crossbar. It was City though who took the lead on  minutes. There seemed little on when substitute Jack Malone’s pass sent Jamie McGonigle racing down the right, but the striker produced a sensational cross right into the heart of the area for Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, who simply had to nod City into a lead they had not been threatening.     The game exploded into drama on  minutes when Ronan Coughlan, on the pitch just  minutes, was red carded for elbowing Ciaran Coll. Danny Lafferty, already on a yellow card, was also sent off for his part in the melee which followed the elbow, with both team playing the final five minutes down to  men. Pat’s, still searching for an equaliser, came so close to a goal in the aftermath, but were denied by a brilliant double save from Gartside, who parried Matty Smith’s shot and then reacted to save from Benson as Derry survived again.  DERRY CITY: Nathan Gartside, Ciaran Coll, Eoin Toal, Cameron McJannett, Ronan Boyce, Danny Lafferty, Ciaron Harkin, Evan McLaughlin , Joe Thomson, Jamie McGonigle , Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe. ST.

The popular festival which usually takes place in Co. Clare every September, was cancelled for the second year in a row due to the pandemic. The cancellations were described as a devastating blow for local businesses as the event draws large crowds from all over Ireland, and abroad, to the North Clare town. googletag.cmd.push  Organisers decided to take the festival to Cabo Roig, a small town in the Alicante region, and despite the change in location, veteran matchmaker Willie Daly promises that love will definitely still be in the air. I dont know quite what to expect, but itll be wonderful to bring Lisdoonna over there. Id imagine the Spanish fellas, with their Latin blood, will be a bit more forward than the Irish lads. Irish lads tend to be shy, and only get going once theyve a rake of pints inside them. The -year-old father of eight, whos Irelands last traditional matchmaker, said hell be using his well-honed techniques to conjure romance on Spanish soil, including bringing his -year-old “love ledger” with him to arrange dates.     The third-generation matchmaker said inquiries had already been flooding in from across the world following the release earlier this year of the Hallmark movie As Luck Would Have It, a romantic movie loosely based on the centuries-old matchmaking festival.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

at half time.Downpatrick were desperately unlucky not to find the back of the net just minutes into the second half,as McGrady ran clear of the defenders after a looping ball over the topseemed to have caught Clonduff napping.With lsquokeeper Gribben already off his line, he made the decision to challenge McGrady in an aerial dual that the Downpatrick number  managed to win.However, his slapped effort over the head of the Clonduff custodian clipped back off the post and backinto the possession of the grateful Yellas.A minute later and the Hoops were back threatening the opposition defence, but Clonduff held firm when Branniganrsquos lsquorsquo effort dropped into the danger zone.Barry OrsquoHagan punished the Hoops for not taking their chances as his free sailed over the bar, before Downpatrickrsquos Oran Cunningham saw his effort drt wide at the other end.Charlie Carr extended his sidersquos lead with his second point of the game, although Tim Prenter managed to keep the RGU in touch with a no-nonsense score.McConville restored the margin with a left footed strike before his free pushed his side further in front.Darren OrsquoHagan showed no signs of slowing down as he began bossing play with piercing runs and cute passing, allowing the Yellas to put a foothold on the game.Doherty saw his free drt wide off the mark before Close punished the Hoops with a finely taken point to close out the action before the second water-break.Downpatrick knew the clock was against them, but they werenrsquot quite at panic station yet, as Brannigan converted yet another free after teammate Sean Bell was fouled.Clonduff midfielder Ross Carr pointed immediately after before Brannigan once more replied with a free.However, Darren OrsquoHagan began the move that would decide the match, after a string of neat passes and clever off the ball movement allowed his brother Barry to nip in behind the Downpatrick defence before calmly slotting home into the bottom right corner.The now six-point advantage truly seemed to deflate the Downpatrick side who now knew it would take something very special to force extra-time.Despite a Brannigan free, McConville wrapped up the scoring with a lovely left footed strike to ensure it was his Clonduff outfit who would enter the semi-final draw.This signalled the end of the road for the Downpatrick men, who gave a great account of themselves in this yearrsquos competition.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney , A Doherty, R Murphy, S Bell, J Bell, C Doherty , D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter , G Collins, C McGrady , J Brannigan , O Cunningham, C Mooney.Subs: T Smyth, P Turley, A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, T Louden, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, G Trainor.Clonduff: P Gribben, J OrsquoHagan, D OrsquoHagan, T McEvoy, L Branagan, C Carr , J Gribben, R Carr, A Carr , T Close , P OrsquoHagan, B OrsquoHagan , A McConville , S McConville, E Brown.Subs: N Trainor, C Brown, R Brannigan, S McGreevy, P Lively, R Lively, T McGreevy, B McConville, P Wilson, J Boden, M McPolin, K OrsquoHagan, F McConville..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Co.jpg","title":"Co Down Rural Community opens new hub in Newcastle  ","story":"THE Co Down Rural Community Network has opened a new wellbeing hub in Newcastle.The new facility is intended to be a central point in the resort to make it easier for people to access information, advice and support and participate in activities to improve their mental and physical health and wellbeing.It will work with iniduals, community members, local groups, and multi-disciplinary teamsto identy community needs and facilitate better access to mental health and wellbeing training and resources.The opening of the new hub is the culmination of the Community Network working with local GPs and primary care teams and the wider community for over  years.Over the past three years, the network has linked up with the MDTs in the local primary care practices.The network has a team of social prescribers and an MDT coordinator who take referrals from GP practices, pharmacists and from other sources and find solutions for people who may be affected by physical limitations or mental health issues or who simply feel isolated in their own homes.This work has intensied during the Covid pandemic, making the opening of the hub even more timely.A total of  people have been referred by the local GPs and their teams to the Community Network since January this year in addition to the  clients that the Social Prescribing team have been working with since .Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairwoman Cathy Mason, who officially opened the news hub on Monday, has described it as a ldquogreat asset for the Community Network team and those who formerly operated a connect and chat service.ldquoGroups of all sorts now have a base to operate from in a beautul and peaceful location.

The project manager Mr Mike Gibb, said Delamont had always been his first option but he could no longer afford to wait on the council.Mr Gibbrsquos announcement dashes hopes that the centre, which is destined to become the largest owl and birds of prey rescue facility in Europe, would come to Killyleagh.Mr Gibb had entered negotiations with Down Council last year regarding the possible construction of the sanctuary at Delamont.But the project became the subject of controversial debates within the council chamber earlier this year amid accusations that council officials were dragging their heels about the proposal, leading Mr Gibb to look for alternative locations.CLOUGH ndash Residents opposing plans for the erection of a BT Cellnet mobile telephone mast in Clough have formed an action group to try and block the plan.At a meeting in the village on Monday, residents got together after they heard local environmentalist, Walter Graham, outlined the drawbacks and health risks associated with these masts.Plans for the -metre mast which,approved, will be sited within the Watsonrsquos filling station complex, were published several weeks ago andaccepted could be operating within months.Up to  residents gathered in the Old School House, just a stonersquos throw from the proposed site, to hear of the risks and implications these masts are believed to cause.Villagers heard how the transmitter could dominate the skyline, towering over homes, a primary school, petrol station and an old peoplersquos home.Claiming that scientists believed the growth of cancers were ldquospurred on by the transmitters, he said. ldquoIf this mast goes up my children are coming out of school, there is no way they will study in the shadow of that mast.

That was understandable in March , but needs to be addressed now.ldquoThe simple inadequacy of the emergency ambulance response times in this area is also a matter of grave concern. We recognise that a major element in that service failure is the y ambulance handover times that can occur at the hospitals with the centralised services.ldquoThat was to be dealt with under the Department of Healthrsquos ldquoNo More Silos document, published a full year ago.

The Trust told us recently that the urgent care centre is lsquomeeting the needs of the publicrsquo but one really has to wonder how this opinion has been formed, said Mrs Trainor.Appealing for increased investment at the Downe site, health campaigners say that the hospital has the capability to do much more.The say the hospitalrsquos bed capacity must be extended to help meet the needs of local communities but also to help address the regional beds shortage caused by the large cut in capacity across Northern Ireland ldquowhich has been brutally exposed during the Covid crisis.The campaigners added: ldquoThe South Eastern Trust should now be looking at a large extension to the hospital, creating new capacity, away from over congested centralised sites, levelling up rural inequality in healthcare provision. That work must be done now and urgently and hand-in-hand with the creation of new medical workforce capacity.ldquoIt is time to build for the future and it is time for all the political parties to vigorously pursue this new investment for the Downe, the peoplersquos hospital.

He seems to flourish when there is hardship.He was out wearing his EDAC vest with pride at the Bradwell Fell Race in the centre of the Peak District.Not an easy one as it comprises eight kilometres and m of climbing with a profile of three steep climbs early in the race, a rolling circuit for a few km on the fell top and then a final steepdescent to the village.The conditions on Saturday were misty and cool on the tops but good for running and helped by a well marked course.The race set off fast into the first climb and Aaron settled back in and around tenth, hoping to work his way forward on the climbs.Over the top of the first climb, there were three main contenders with Aaron one of them.He took the lead on the way over the second climb and managed to put in a hard burst over the top and down the second descent.When he couldnrsquot hear the sound of the others breathing, he knew he had created a good gap so he relaxed a little on the third climb to gather some energy for the loop on the top.He was reasonably confident that he had built about a  second lead when he reached the final descent, but he gave it a good rattle anyway crossing the finish line with well over a minute to spare.Great pacing and a pleasing result.This weekend sees the Cross Country season taking the headlines with the NI Mastersrsquo Trials at Queenrsquos Playing Fields.Entries for this are now closed but those who are taking part will be vying for selection for the upcoming Home Countries event in November.Plenty of others will also be planning some off road training in order to prepare for the Bobby Rea XC which is the week after.It is great to see some recent recruits adding their name to the team entry and hopefully they will enjoy their first experience of lsquothe muckrsquo.

Three minutes later the visitors had their first effort when from Casey Courtneyrsquos long throw, Christopher McKay headed back to Courtney but his enterprising effort was wide.Villa should have been ahead in the th minute but Aaron Carberry produced an outstanding double save.The game was being played at a frantic pace with both midfields battling for supremacy with Jon Joe Sharvin and Darren McConnell linking to produce an outstanding pass for Jack Sharvin but his effort was well blocked.Soon afterwards there was almost a repeat with McConnell and Barry Walsh linking, and Jack Sharvin flashing the ball across the six yard box.Killyleagh were playing some neat football with Jonny Murray and Jon Joe Sharvin combining for Jamie Sharvin to almost thread it through for Declan McComiskey. There was time for Jamie Sharvin to stride forward and try a long range effort.The visitors have made an outstanding start to the season, reaching the quarter finals of the Steel Cup, and they knocked the ball about with confidence as they had their best spell of the game.A free kick from the impressive Arthurs was cleared for a corner in the th minute and then, six minutes later, first Jamie Sharvin blocked the effort from McKayrsquos knock down, and Jonny Murray cleared a clever short corner as Thomas Dickson prepared to strike.At the opposite end twice before the interval Jack Sharvin went close, first with a free kick on the far left and then he had an effort cleared off the line in the nd minute but in truth both teams were very evenly matched in the first half.Killyleagh took control in the second half with a midfield masterclass from Barry Walsh and Darren McConnell in particular, and McComiskey having a lot of joy down the left side.

Jack Sharvin curled the ball round his marker Hylands from the edge of the box and into the stanchion of the goal in the th minute.It was a goal worthy of winning any cup tie, at any level. For a long time it looked asit would.Killyleagh had half chances, after this, with Walsh again winning his midfield tussle with Dickson to set up Jon Joe Sharvin and then Jack Sharvin went even closer from brother Jamiersquos free kick. Villa had half chances too at the opposite end with Jake Wilson going close to an equaliser.Then came that dramatic finale.

This is normally when I reach for the headphones, plug them into the laptop and search on the web for Bach or Beethoven to block out the external noise.Preacher Man belts out his hymns before handing out religious tracts to workers, shoppers, school kids and tourists who pass him by. He often starts his pitch just after a young red-haired Croatian woman finishes off her busking routine in the same street. The switch in styles and sound is eerily seamless.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Henry McDonald is a formerand Observer Ireland correspondent and author of books including a biography of David Trimble and INLA: Deadly DivisionsIt appears almost asthe two of them have some kind of unwritten agreement as to when one of them wrap ups their set and the other takes to the street-stage.Although his repertoire is out of tune Preacher Man still has a powerful voice for someone in his late sixties or early seventies, which somehow feels connected to the strength of his religious conviction. It booms and resonates above the constant whoosh of buses and Gliders passing by in Wellington Place.While I am an atheist and secularist who believes in the separation of all churches from the state, I cannot help but admire the dedication of this lone grey haired, slightly built, eternally smiling evangelical singer pressing his leaflets non-intrusively towards a generally indferent Belfast public.There are other preachers also with a daily presence milling around the centre of the city who are,you like, more dficult “hard cases” for us non-believers. They either drive around in a car with a PA sound system mounted on its roof barking out conservative evangelical Christian messages in the same way politicians sell themselves on four wheels at election time or  they stand up in places like Cornmarket.They are also followed around the city centre by an equally determined knot of youthful LGBT activists who wave rainbow flags while staring face-off at those who preach among other things the so-called “sin” of homosexuality. Often the police are not far from the scene in case things get out of hand although in the numerous times I have witnessed these stand-offs both preachers and protestors have been entirely peaceful.Some on the left in this society believe that there should be no free speech for those labelled “hate preachers.” The Garda Siochana seem to share that view because at present three evangelical Christians are being tried in a Dundalk court for preaching against homosexuality in the Co Louth town back on September . The trio were arrested that day, handcuffed and charged with public order offences at Dundalk Garda station.Indeed, the PSNI set the bar for policing-the-preachers earlier this year by arresting other evangelicals in Larne, Enniskillen and Newry because they were accused of transmitting the same anti-gay messages.Yet the case of the Dundalk , the right of the hard-line preachers to offend those young activists that shadow them around Belfast city centre and the Gospel tract giving, solo singing preacher man outside my window all present liberals, socialists and secularists with the “Town Square Test”.This challenge was set in  by Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident, Jewish refusenik in the USSR and human rights activist.In his book ‘The Case For Democracy’, Sharansky said the threshold test for a free society was this: “If a person cannot walk into the middle of the town square and express his or her views without fear of arrest, imprisonment or physical harm, then that person is in a fear society, not a free society.”The radical flag waving band of LGBT demonstrators who stalk their evangelical opponents have every right to a space in that ‘town square’.Yet those they protest against also deserve their place in that public square too as do the Dundalk  no matter how ludicrous, objectionable or homophobic you think their street sermons may sound.So long as no one is publicly urging violence against those with lestyles they disapprove of then their right to free speech and free preach should be defended like everyone ’s. To start cherry picking who is allowed in the ‘town square’ is the slippery slope to a nascent form of totalitarianism.As I write on this typical Belfast autumnal day with an insipidly grey sky above and a seasonal chill in the air the street beyond my window it is unusually quiet. There are no medleys of s or s cult rock classics being rattled out on guitar by the Croatian busker or any Christian hymns being sung by the dogged evangelist who often encroaches on my concentration. I hope and guess that they both willsoon to Fountain Street and continue to occupy their rightful place also in Sharansky’s ‘public square.’• Owen Polley Oct : The EU didn’t even try to address the assault on NI’s place in UK• Ben Lowry Oct : Lord Frost’s speech on NI reflected notably more robust UK tactics• Peter Robinson Oct :  Any unionist praising the Good Friday Agreement is a heretic• Ruth Dudley Edwards Oct : SF is the driving force in the Irish demonisation of Israel• Other articles by Henry McDonald below, beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter:• Henry McDonald Oct : Colm Toibin spurns misty-eyed guff about a ‘New Ireland’• Henry McDonald Oct : The biggest task for unionists is to get out their non voters• Henry McDonald Sep : For all the gushing attitudes to the EU in Dublin, Brussels can’t rely on Ireland to help it with an EU army• Henry McDonald Sep : Row involving President Higgins confirms that those who want a tolerant Ireland are being marginalised• Henry McDonald Sep : Journalists should shun this Dublin-funded study into how the media uses language• Henry McDonald Sep : The cross border policing pursuit plan has not been thought through• Henry McDonald Aug : INLA’s biggest propaganda coup since Wright murder• Henry McDonald Aug : Irish nationalists can’t rely on Biden, as Kabul shows——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Everything that has been said about him in all these tributes is actually true. He was just well liked and he was very cheerful and encouraging.”I remember talkingto him after I came in and he was interested in the new MP from Northern Ireland. He was very encouraging and a very nice guy.”Lord Dodds said he had a big focus on animal welfare and in more recent years campaigned relentlessly for South End to be made a city“Every time he raised it there was a laugh because everyone was expecting it. He was never in high ministerial office and he never really sought that kind of political career. He was really a guy that made a lot of connections across all the parties at Westminster and was very well liked. He had been an MP for almost  years.”Lord Dodds also recounted the occasion when he was almost murdered as an MP.His six-year-old son Andrew was in the Intensive Care Unit of the Children’s Hospital at the Royal Victoria Hospital at the time, in . He and his we Diane were collecting several items in the city centre when they got a call to come to the hospital urgently.Because it was urgent they rushed to the hospital without waiting for their usual police bodyguards. They were in the waiting room while medical staff worked with their son nearby.“And then we heard these almightybangs - shots ringing out in the corridor - and one of the nurses screaming and someone shouting for me to get down and block the door.“For what seemed an age it all stopped and then there was all this screaming and shouting. Eventually, as there was no way out of the room, we just opened the door. By this stage the gunmen had left.“The first thing we saw was a childs’ incubator with bullet holes in it. The police bodyguard who had arrived by that stage had been shot in the leg. It was bedlam.”The policeman had spotted two men coming down the corridor wearing wigs and had challenged them, so they had not been able to get any closer to the politician.“If they hadn’t been there they would have been able to walk straight down to us.”He added that the security threat faced by MPs in Northern Ireland during the Troubles was massively greater than that faced by MPs in England.“Rev Ian Paisley had bodyguards around the clock and at his house, as did Peter Robinson.“But for Assembly members and MPs this was almost something that you lived with.”Dissident republicans left a bomb outside the office on the Shore Road in . Others have received many threats and partial bombs.“Even after the Good Friday Agreement politicians in Northern Ireland have been very much targetedand have had to live with it. Typically they often had security at their offices and houses,bullet proof windows, panic alarms and even personal protection weapons.“Two MPs killed in five years in England is horrendous but for  years in NI MPs lived with this as a daily threat.”He noted that UUP MP Robert Bradford was killed in  killed during a surgery in Finaghy, along with his bodyguard. And that UUP assembly member Edgar Graham was shot dead in  outside Queen’s University.Fellow DUP member councillor David Calvert was shot and badly wounded in thelate s. And in the early s SDLP senator Paddy Wilson and his girlfriend were “brutally murdered” by loyalists, he added.But today, he believes that social media has “intensied and heightened” hatred towards MPs “especially women” and can also be used to gather intelligence on their movements.“They whip up an extraordinary amount of hatred and threats and I think these social media companies have got to stop this ability for people to go online anonymously and say whatever they like.”  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular‘Our angel’ message from heartbroken sister following workplace tragedyNorthern Ireland Conservative Party suffers four leadership resignations while local Ukip group disbands over NI ProtocolEU vows to protect Irelandnegotiations on protocol failSinn Fein leader should clary her view on the past murder of elected Northern Ireland politiciansJeff Dudgeon to European human rights commissioner: You attack the UK for this amnesty but not for past ones that benefitted terrorists — why not Most PopularReport of rats roaming ambulance station sparks investigationOwen Polley: The EU did not even try to address the assault on Northern Ireland’s place in the United KingdomBen Lowry: Lord Frost’s speech on the Northern Ireland Protocol reflected a notably more robust UK approach to the borderIan Paisley: David Amess and I hit it off instantly — me an Ulster Protestant, he a Roman CatholicA message from the editor of the world’s oldest English language daily newspaper                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These burrows were once part of a huge dune system that stretched all the way from the River Ogmore to the Gower peninsula and this area along with Kenfig is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest.With the dogs racing ahead enjoying their adventure and freedom, the narrow sandy paths adorned in places by the pretty Michaelmas-daisy led them through the burrows before turning southwards towards the coast.Reaching Kenfig Sands where the tide was on the ebb there were fantastic views south westwards towards Jersey Marine, Swansea Bay, Mumbles and Gower beyond as they settled down utilising washed up tree trunks as seating for morning refreshments in warm sunshine with a welcome breeze.Returning onto the coast path above the beach the group made their way eastwards to reach Sker Point with its fantastic long-distance views back across Kenfig Sands, spoiled only by the industrial smoke and buildings of Port Talbot Steelworks.Following the coastline soon the yellow painted Sker House came into view which signalled their lunch stop overlooking Sker Rocks which was the setting on April , , when the Samtampa a former Liberty ship was making its way up the Bristol Channel towards Newport in a south westerly gale. Developing an engine fault, the captain dropped anchor so repairs could begin, but the weather worsened to hurricane force winds, the ship slipped its anchor and was driven onto Sker Rocks. Mumbles leboat was launched to try to save the crew, but the Samtampa began to break up and all  of its crew drowned, along with the eight volunteer crew members of the Mumbles leboat which was later found upside down and smashed to pieces.     Continuing along the coast path with views across Rest Bay to Locks Common in Porthcawl and reaching the western perimeter of the Royal Porthcawl Golf Club, they ventured inland following a narrow path between fences, with a field of beautul Welsh Black cattle as the heat rose, before an open field brought them through a gate into Nottage.A short journey along the busy and fast-moving West Road brought them to a rough track opposite Parc Newydd Farm, which led them to overlook the impressive, imposing and dramatic Grade One listed Sker House, which was originally founded by the Cistercian monks of Neath as one of five farms or granges to support Neath Abbey. The house was remodelled by the Turberville family in the mid-th century after which it was tenanted and then sold to the Williams family in the late th century.This was when the romantic, heart rendering story of the lsquoMaid of Skerrsquo began involving Elizabeth Williams, an attractive young lady who loved to dance in the old Town Hall above the Prince of Wales Inn at Kenfig, where the music was supplied by a harpist.One evening the harpist was Thomas Evans and upon meeting they were smitten and fell in love. For a while he courted her, but her father was against the union as he felt being the daughter of a successful landowner and farmer, Thomas Evans was beneath her as he was a mere carpenter and so he imprisoned her in Sker House.The couple tried to elope, but their plans were thwarted and until Elizabeth agreed to marry her fatherrsquos choice of husband - Thomas Kirkwood of Neath - she was not freed. They married and had four children settling in Briton Ferry, but it was an unhappy liaison andher true love was playing in the area, Elizabeth would sneak out to hear him play. She died in , it is said of a broken heart, and was buried at Llansamlet, but her unfulfilled and unhappy ghost is said to still walk at Sker.Following a track and crossing part of the Pyle and Kenfig golf course brought them back to their start point after what had been a delightful scenic and interesting tramp through history in stunning weather for the month of October.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
