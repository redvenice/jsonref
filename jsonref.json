And it all comes back to the same people, the same business model, the same industry.\u0027Asked whether he had regrets, he replied: \u0027My biggest regret is not making more of a stance. Calling out racism when I did. History was repeating itself.\u0027Harry claimed that it was only him and their unborn child that kept Meghan going, after she told him about her suicidal thoughts and the practicalities of how she was going to end her life.He said: \u0027The thing that stopped her from seeing it through was how unfair it would be on me after everything that had happened to my mum and to now be put in a position of losing another woman in my life, with a baby inside of her, our baby.\u0027He said he was \u0027somewhat ashamed\u0027 of the way he dealt with it, suggesting that rather than prioritising their official duties they should have pulled out. But at the time, Harry said, that was not an option, because of \u0027the system\u0027.Harry said that after marrying Meghan his attempts to get help from his family, following online trolling which was pushing her to the brink, were ignored.He said: \u0027Every single ask, request, warning, whatever it is, to stop just got met with total silence or total neglect.\u0027Harry added: \u0027We spent four years trying to make it work. We did everything that we possibly could to stay there and carry on doing the role and doing the job.\u0027He said he did not go to his family when Meghan felt suicidal because he was ashamed the situation had got \u0027that bad\u0027 and also suspected the royals would not have been able to help.The duke said: \u0027That was one of the biggest reasons to leave, feeling trapped and feeling controlled through fear, both by the media and by the system itself which never encouraged the talking about this kind of trauma. Certainly now I will never be bullied into silence.\u0027 Harry was also shown taking part in an eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy session with a trained professional.He said: \u0027Therapy has equipped me to be able to take on anything - that\u0027s why I\u0027m here now, that\u0027s why my wife is here now.\u0027His comments will no doubt have increased the much publicised tensions within the royal family following Harry and Meghan\u0027s bombshell interview with Oprah in March.In that programme the Sussexes first accused the royal family of not supporting them, claimed royal aides declined to help Meghan when she was troubled with suicidal thoughts and said a relative had made a racist comment about their son\u0027s skin colour. Hours before the new show aired, Harry joined his brother the Duke of Cambridge in criticising the BBC following an inquiry which found the broadcaster covered up \u0027deceitful behaviour\u0027 used by journalist Martin Bashir to secure his headline-making 1995 interview with their mother. The series comes after Harry appeared to suggest his father and grandparents, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, had all failed as parents during a podcast interview broadcast earlier in May. "},{"url":null,"title":"Herd immunity NEVER official policy dealing Covid Downing Street insists","story":"Share this articleShare this article¿Hypocrite¿ Dominic Cummings accused of trying to rewrite the past over Covid response | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Melbourne brings strict Covid restrictions state records four cases","story":"Share this articleCoronavirus Victoria: No Melbourne lockdown as missing links to COVID-19 cluster sought after cases balloon to four, Highpoint Shopping Centre listed as exposure site"},{"url":null,"title":"Facebook tried censor posts vaccine hesitancy according leaked documents","story":"Share this articleO\u0027Keefe: \u0027More to come\u0027 after Project Veritas release docs revealing Facebook censoring \u0027vaccine hesitancy\u0027 | Fox NewsBREAKING: Facebook Whistleblowers Expose LEAKED INTERNAL DOCS Detailing New Effort to Secretly Censor Vaccine Concerns on a Global Scale | Project Veritas"},{"url":null,"title":"Calls clarity government tells Britons NOT travel Indian variant hotspots","story":"Share this article Because the vaccines were shown to be highly effective at stopping people falling ill with Covid in the first place, PHE said they are likely to be even better at preventing hospitalisation and deaths.Professor Pollard said that a few more weeks were needed to firm up this claim, but he added that, traditionally, vaccines offer \u0027much, much higher\u0027 protection against hospitalisation and death than mild infection. However, both Pfizer and AstraZeneca\u0027s jabs were only 33 per cent effective at blocking symptoms of the Indian strain three weeks after one dose, compared to 50 per cent against the Kent variant. Officials say it highlights the importance of getting both injections. Professor Pollard told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \u0027If the current generation of vaccines are able to stop people going into hospital, whilst there is still mild infections, people are getting the common cold with the virus, then the pandemic is over.\u0027Because we can live with the virus, in fact we are going to have to live with the virus in one way or another, but it doesn\u0027t matter if most people are kept out of hospital because then the NHS can continue to function and life will be back to normal. We just need a little bit more time to have certainty around this.\u0027 Ministers say England is on track for all restrictions to be dropped as planned on June 21, despite fears the rapid spread of the Indian variant would jeopardise \u0027freedom day\u0027. Armed with the PHE evidence vaccines work against B.1.617.2, the boss of the UK\u0027s Health Security Agency argued the prospect of all Covid restrictions being lifted next month was \u0027looking good\u0027. Health Secretary Matt Hancock also called the findings \u0027groundbreaking\u0027. But some scientists are not convinced by No10\u0027s ever-growing optimism, saying May 17\u0027s relaxation of lockdown measures may trigger a rapid spike in cases given that the Indian variant is \u0027on the cusp\u0027 of becoming dominant in England. Professor Christina Pagel, a member of the Independent SAGE panel of scientists, said ministers should consider \u0027rolling back step three of the roadmap\u0027 if cases continue to rise this week. Department of Health figures show the number of positive tests has jumped by 11 per cent over the past seven days.Hospitalisations and deaths across the UK are at their lowest levels since the crisis began, with just six fatalities a day and fewer than 100 hospital admissions, on average. For comparison, around 1,300 deaths were occurring every day at the peak of the second wave in January.However, the number of infected patients occupying beds at the major NHS trust in Bolton — one of the country\u0027s hotspots for the Indian variant — has continued to creep up over the past week.There is no proof the Indian variant is more lethal than older strains of the coronavirus but data shows it is more transmissible than the Kent type, which triggered Britain\u0027s devastating second wave before vaccines were rolled out. Experts believe B.1.617.2 is 30 per cent more infectious than B.1.1.7 — the name for the Kent strain — but won\u0027t get any concrete data for at least another week.Ministers urged to clarify travel advice for England’s Covid hotspots | Coronavirus | The Guardian(COVID-19) Coronavirus restrictions: what you can and cannot do - GOV.UK"},{"url":null,"title":"good to see you businesses on welcoming back customers","story":"Even before the Covid-19 pub closures were officially announced, Burnett and his team had made the difficult decision to shut up shop. “We’re best known in Cardiff as a cabaret venue for the LGBT+ scene,” he says. “Even before lockdown, people were starting to get nervous about Covid and were staying away, so I knew we’d have to close.” But after learning that the closures were likely to be long term, Burnett decided that “the show must go on”. “We normally do cabaret four or five nights a week – our customers regularly travel to Cardiff to visit the gay bars because they don’t have those connections locally,” he says. So, led by the pub’s resident drag queen, Baroness Mary Golds, the team decided to try streaming their cabaret show live on Facebook. The first one received such rave reviews that they ran another the following night, this time including a link to a GoFundMe page. “We still had costs even though the pub was standing empty,” says Burnett. “I was expecting we’d raise £1,000 over four or five weeks but we reached £1,000 on that first night, thanks to the way our customers supported us.” Buoyed by the overwhelming response, the team continued to broadcast drag shows four times a week, raising close to £16,000, much of which went to local charities and causes. “We’ve raised almost £7,000 for charities like Homeless Hope, which looks after the feet of the homeless. We’ve also sent ‘love bundles’ to performers, because performing arts – and the performers themselves – have been hit hard by Covid. “Mary was very much a hero, performing four nights a week – and bear in mind these people weren’t getting paid. We really were in this together.” When it came to reopening the pub in April, customers were greeted by major changes, coordinated by bar manager Evan Perkins. “We revamped the bar area, created a bigger outside space and have sanitisers at every entry and exit point, and around the building,” says Burnett. Performers lead customers to the tables outside, while explaining the regulations. For now, the cabaret performances continue to be streamed from an upstairs room while they make arrangements for when live entertainment can resume. “Mary says she’s going to cry the first time she hears a live round of applause – at the moment we have fake applause at the end of each song or joke,” says Burnett. He says the response from regulars has been incredible. “I was due to leave at the end of the year – I’d said after five years I’d move on – but the community has supported us through the worst year in history for hospitality, so how can I leave now? “Yesterday, I walked into the beer garden and it was blowing a gale but was full of people sat there in raincoats, getting soaked. They just raised their glasses and went ‘cheers’. It says a lot about how much they value this place.” “The last year has been incredibly hard but having nearly lost my business during the recession, I knew I could get through difficult times again. I’ve run the salon since 2002 and there’s 10 of us here. The salon means different things to people – for some, it’s just a haircut but for others it’s a community. Some customers come several times a week because they aren’t physically able to do their hair at home, so they really rely on us. “I think this past year has made people realise how important their local salon is – the relationships they’ve built and how that impacts on how they feel. “Being told we were closing was devastating but I took the mindset of ‘this isn’t going to beat me’. I furloughed everybody except my managing director and as I was already a business coach helping other salons, I used the time to write a book sharing advice for salon owners, as well as putting on free business events. “The two of us communicated as much as we could with our team and clients, running Facebook quizzes and sharing pictures on social media of us growing out our roots for example, reminding clients we were still very much with them. “Before reopening, the team went through infection control training and we put in a sanitising station and implemented things like PPE. We also added a doorbell so people can’t just walk in, and put signs on the floor saying where to stand and walk. “It’s been tough, but everybody has adapted brilliantly. Hairdressers are so passionate about what they do, we’ve really missed the creativity of it all.” “One of our most important goals for these first few months, and shows, is making the audience feel as comfortable as we can. “We’ve bought thermal imaging cameras to take everyone’s temperature as they enter the theatre, which can read 30 people per second. If someone’s temperature is too high, we’ll wait a few minutes and check them with a handheld thermometer. “Unfortunately, if they still have a high temperature, we’ll have to refund them their ticket as we have to maintain safety for everybody involved. “Our cafe has been open since we were allowed to reopen for takeaway, and we will start offering socially distanced indoor dining in our cafe on the week of 17 May. The first two shows are on the 18th and 19th, and the audience and staff will still have to wear face coverings. “This will be our 135th anniversary season. It’s been tough, but we still have hope. “There are a lot of rules backstage, too. Things like the green room have changed –we had one for everyone, but now it’s for visiting companies and we have facilities elsewhere for our staff.” “We’ve actually made quite a few changes since lockdown. Something I realised I was missing was the interaction with people. Before Covid, we were predominantly a sourdough bakery with a seating area, where we served lunches very much based on local produce. “When the cafe had to close we decided to reduce the amount of seating, move bread sales in there and expand our range of products. By moving things round we made a larger space for people, and we built a pantry area with lots of ingredients for things that people could recreate at home. We also invested in a large retail fridge to stock Irish cheeses. “It has a very honest and open feel, and we’re able to have that connection with our customers that I’d been missing. That said, we have sanitiser at the door and counter, and ask people to pay by card when possible. “Our delivery van is used by more than one member of staff, so it has been kitted out with sanitiser and gloves. We also try to minimise the number of staff who are working at close quarters on shift. “When we could only serve takeaway, we realised that people had the habit of getting a loaf and some sweet things and heading off for a picnic. Because of there being more takeaway we had to invest in packaging, we went for the compostable type. I’m surrounded by boxes of boxes! “In terms of opening more fully, we’re waiting for confirmation on whether we’ll have to do table service once people can eat inside, and when we know we’ll arrange the seating accordingly. “It’s strange because everybody is going to open at the same time, but we’re so lucky as our customers are so loyal.” We can all play our part in keeping each other safe.

Feelings of self-doubt and a sudden lack of confidence consumed me. Like many people, I’ve been wondering how to actually socialise again. My anxiety levels have skyrocketed. Lockdown has played tricks with my ego and confidence. The question has been what to do about it. As a busy mum-of-three, I don’t exactly have bags of spare time. During lockdown I’d become intrigued by TikTok. I’d looked at some of the uplifting videos that had gone viral and grabbed the whole world’s attention. But I sensed there was more to TikTok than just dance fads. Could its wealth of videos about every subject under the sun help me regain my social skills and self-confidence? I start my exploration of motivational TikTok videos by granting myself permission for some basic “me time”. Given my hectic schedule, I’ve never really been one for so-called “me time” – but watching and listening to some everyday women with little sprinklings of genius on TikTok really made me stop and think: hold on, it is actually about me. “You can’t give to your family from an empty cup,” explains TikTok creator @ivanarichey – one of her many short and snappy pearls of wisdom. I scoffed at it at first, and thought what a cliche. But then I realised that, actually, if I go down, then pretty much the whole ship goes down too. From then on, whenever I could grab five minutes in between the school run and dinnertime, I’d have a quick browse at some other motivational accounts to give me that extra perk I needed to make it through to bedtime. “Compliment yourself, praise yourself,” says TikTok creator @spencer.barbosa, whose motivational gems and quick and quirky style tips will perk you up in an instant. Another of her quotes that I loved was: “You don’t have to be the best, just be the best version of yourself.” I don’t know what it was that made me more receptive to heeding advice in this format. It could have been the sincerity and authenticity of the TikTok creators themselves. It could have been their uplifting vibe or disarming humour. Or it could have been the snappy, no-nonsense format. But pretty soon, I was hooked. I honestly hadn’t actually realised until now just how important and effective it is to consciously lift yourself up, dust off that crown, and so on. Suddenly, the prospect of seeing my friends and socialising again after nearly 18 months didn’t seem so daunting. One of the things I used to love doing before lockdown was get a makeover in the lead-up to a glam event. Given that this has not been an option for quite some time, I wondered if I’d ever be glam again and didn’t want to shock people when they saw me in person. I realised I was a far cry from my filtered image on social media. So I started scrolling for quick makeovers for those of us with not much time to spare. And @thepatriciabright was just the tonic I needed to give me the lift to get my face back on and get back out there. Her videos were great for providing seemingly instant glam, and they were so funny, too – especially when she teamed up with her hubby for a parody clip. It’s amazing what a sprinkling of gold dust over your cheekbones can do. And makeup artist @dominiqueallison taught me some awesome mum tricks to hide those bags by putting a slick of concealer on over your foundation. She also whipped up some funky retro looks for when we are allowed to go #outout again. I’m also a big fan of videos posted by @jaimykoroma and @werejagreeneyes, which had me in hysterics with her life hacks in ultra-short, 10-second videos. A change was coming and it didn’t have to be scary. Something remarkable was happening. Thanks to TikTok, I realised I could love life – and myself – after lockdown.

While the immigration rules take effect on Tuesday, the ban on direct flights will go into force on 1 June 1, it added. The statement referred specifically to the World Health Organization and Public Health England having classified the B.1.617.2 variant first found in India as a “variant of concern”.Dozens of countries are facing severe oxygen shortages because of surging Covid-19 cases, threatening the “total collapse” of health systems. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism analysed data provided by the Every Breath Counts Coalition, the NGO Path and the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) to find the countries most at risk of running out of oxygen. It also studied data on global vaccination rates. There are concerns that other Asian countries like Laos are at risk, and African countries including Nigeria, Ethiopia, Malawi and Zimbabwe, which have less mature oxygen delivery systems, meaning a small increase in need could create big problems. Many of these countries faced oxygen shortages before the pandemic, said Leith Greenslade, coordinator of the Every Breath Counts Coalition. The extra need is pushing health systems to the brink. “The situation last year, and again in January this year in Brazil and Peru, should have been the wake up call,” she said. “But the world did not wake up. We should have known India would happen after seeing what happened in Latin America. And now looking at Asia, we should know this will happen in some of the big cities in Africa.” Read more here: Oxygen shortages threaten ‘total collapse’ of dozens of health systems Arenberger had been the fourth person to hold the post since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020. He is due to hold a news conference later today.I’ll be continuing with the biggest world coronavirus developments here.Neha Arora and Manas Mishra report for Reuters that there are still serious concerns that many new infections are not being reported, due to a dearth of testing in the countryside, where the virus has spread to from the cities. The Serum Institute of India, which is supplying the AstraZeneca vaccine, and local firm Bharat Biotech, which is providing Covaxin, have both said they are ramping up production but the supply remains way short of the millions of doses India needs. “The vaccination drive is in shambles and people are suffering and despairing,” Anand Sharma, a leader of the main opposition party Congress said, urging prime minister Narendra Modi to put aside politics and work with state governments to help them procure vaccines. Pfizer said it was in talks with the Indian government to supply its vaccine, which has still to be cleared by India’s drug regulator. “Pfizer remains committed to continuing our engagement with the government of India towards making the Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine available for use in the country,” a spokeswoman told Reuters, declining to provide details of the ongoing discussions. In desperation, several Indian state governments and even cities such as Mumbai have launched their own global tenders or sought expressions of interest from firms such as Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson for urgent supplies. But Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the three firms told them they were in touch with the federal Indian government and that they will not be dealing with state level authorities. Sisodia blamed Modi’s government for mishandling vaccine procurement and not moving fast enough to secure supplies for the country.Hesitancy can become a tempting explanation for low vaccine coverage when governments seek to deflect attention from health system problems. For news editors, a story about a person rejecting vaccination because of their beliefs is probably more interesting than reporting a more prosaic lack of transport or inconvenient clinic hours. However, we should not paint out of the vaccination picture iniduals like the two women I spoke with this week, both affected by disability and both uniquely struggling to access the Covid-19 vaccine they wanted. Being open and curious about why vaccination take-up is low is good for public health. It starts with asking the affected community. In Romania, for instance, a large measles outbreak in 2016 was thought to be caused by active refusal of vaccination. Then a survey of 520 caregivers of children with measles asked them directly. It turns out the main barriers to these children being vaccinated were long waiting times, vaccines running out and not being aware of a vaccine due. Beliefs about side effects also featured, but not as much as expected. Behavioural scientists have reviewed studies to find the interventions with the largest impact on vaccine uptake. Those most effective include: making vaccines free and services convenient, reminders when a vaccine is due, default appointments, performance monitoring and feedback, on-site vaccination, standing orders, incentives and requirements. Read more here: Julie Leask – Being open about why Australia’s vaccination take-up is low is the first step to improve it Reasons for the rise in vaccine hesitancy were unclear in the polls, but there are widespread complaints at government disorganisation, delays in getting vaccines and reliance on Sinovac and locally made AstraZeneca doses. Thailand has reported 135,439 infections and 832 deaths since the pandemic began last year. Asked whether a family from Bolton, where new guidance calling on people to limit their interactions and travel has been issued, should go ahead with half-term holiday plans to a “green list” country, Coffey said: “I’m not going to give inidual travel guidance on some hypothetical situations to people in different parts of the country. The guidance is very clear that people need to consider whether it really is essential.” I’ve just used the government website to check how clear the advice is. On the page about the red, amber and green list countries, the word “essential” only appears once, in this paragraph: “I’ve signed SB 267! Since the development of the Covid-19 vaccine, both Dr Scott Harris (state health officer) and I have said that we would not mandate vaccines in the state of Alabama,” the governor said in a statement on Monday. “I am supportive of a voluntary vaccine, and by signing this bill into law, I am only further solidifying that conviction”, Ivey, a Republican, said on Monday. The governor’s statement added that Ivey has been vaccinated and would “encourage any Alabamian who has not gotten their shot to roll up their sleeves”. Kanishka Singh reports for Reuters that the Alabama Republican party said the law was “protecting the privacy rights of Alabamians from the federal overreach of the Biden administration”. The administration of President Joe Biden has opposed the idea of making vaccine passports mandatory.Previous such bans have been imposed because of high numbers of coronavirus infections or cases of a particular variant of the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Farmers could face \u0026lsquosignificant drop in income\u0026rsquo due to environmentally-driven changesSealing deal on making decarbonisation a reality set to break new ground in difficultyLeft unaddressed, stranded fossil fuel assets will become a colossal headache"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Return would be a great success for Bord na M\u0026oacutena\u0026rsquos peatland bioersity measures"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

File photograph: Alan BetsonA rise in Covid-19 infections in Limerick is leading to a surge in the number of people seeking tests for the virus in the county as the number of people in hospital has increased.Some 920 people had sought coronavirus tests in the HSE’s walk-in centres in Limerick by 5pm on Monday compared with 526 at the same time last week, a 75 per cent increase. Niamh O’Beirne, the HSE’s national lead on testing and contract tracing, said that Covid-19 tests were seeing “very high footfall” of people through testing sites in Limerick.There were 1,437 people seeking tests in Limerick on Saturday and Sunday compared with 804 the previous weekend as symptomatic and asymptomatic people checked to see if they are infected.Referrals for tests from GPs have been prevented due to the cyberattack on the HSE. The rate for people testing positive stood at 6.3 per cent in Limerick compared with a national average of 4 per cent. Health officials urged Limerick people to work from home as local cases of surged to almost 260 in the past week, according to the Department of Public Health Mid-West.A free pop-up walk-in testing centre is to be provided from 12pm-7pm, on the grounds of St Joseph’s Hospital, Mulgrave Street for five days initially from this Wednesday.A spokesman for University Hospital Limerick (UHL) said the amount of inpatient Covid-19 cases had increased from two to 12 in the past week.Dr Mai Mannix, director of public health midwest, said her contact tracing team in Limerick had seen a growing number of cases emerging from a rise in large indoor social gatherings including house parties, birthday parties, end of year academic celebrations and the recent Eid festivities.“We are seeing young adults, people in their 30s and 40s who are parents of young children, being hospitalised. Luckily, obviously our older age group is now immunised, so we are not seeing that group being hospitalised or infected to any large extent,” she told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. A source at UHL said a number of patients in the hospital’s intensive care unit were in the younger adult age bracket, which was concerning.Dr Mannix said she had not seen this level of infection in Limerick since early March and that if daily cases keep rising, coupled with the strain from dealing with the cyberattack on the HSE, the health service would find itself “in a very troubling position”.Limited figures released by the Department of Health due to the cyberattack showed 345 new cases of Covid-19 were reported nationally, though this figure could be later revised.There were 127 people in hospital with the virus, of whom 44 are in intensive care. The virus positivity rate on testing is high in other parts of country, at 6 per cent in Ballymun and 5.3 per cent in Blanchardstown, Dublin and 5.3 per cent in Letterkenny, Co Donegal. Contact tracers and public health officials reported new cases among younger people and students as a result of social gatherings to mark the end of academic year or the end of exams. In a further recovery from the cyberattack, the HSE will recommence assigning automatic appointments for close contacts of Covid-19 cases rather directing them to visit a testing centre. Close contacts will be directed to attend “day zero” and “day 10” appointments for tests.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"indoor dining time limit of 105 minutes groups to be capped at six","story":"There will be a distance of one metre between tables, and a limit of six people per booking. Photograph: iStockNew guidelines for the resumption of hospitality to be released on Tuesday will put a 105-minute time limit on indoor visits to pubs and restaurants, it is understood.Sources say the guidelines will have a huge focus on ventilation for indoor venues when they reopen, likely in July.There will be a distance of one metre between tables, and a limit of six people per booking.For outdoor dining a distance of one metre will also apply, and it will be up to each establishment to decide if they want to set a time limit and if so how long this should be for.The CEO of the Restaurants Association of Ireland (RAI) Adrian Cummins said that the hospitality sector was looking forward to returning, but he repeated a call for all restaurants to be allowed to serve food indoors from June 2nd, the same date on which hotels will be allowed to do so.Mr Cummins said rules permitting hotels to serve food indoors should be extended to all restaurants. “We would like to open in line with hotels because there is no difference between a hotel restaurant and an independent restaurant next door to them,” he told Newstalk Breakfast.“The indications are that the guidelines will be, there or thereabouts, the same as last year for indoor hospitality, but the difference for outdoor hospitality will be that there will be no time limits for people,” he said.Last year’s guidelines had worked well for the food business, they had been implemented “as best we could”, he said.“We are looking forward to these being published so people can start to plan and prepare for reopening when we get a date to reopen restaurants, gastropubs and coffeeshops across the country.”Mr Cummins welcomed the one-metre space between tables, anything bigger would leave many businesses unviable, he warned.“We always said that one metre is a viable space for hospitality but two metres is not viable at all because you lose nearly 75 per cent of your space within a business. At one metre, you still lose space. You lose about 25 per cent of your space within a restaurant. That is a loss of income, that puts a lot of pressure on a business to operate viably.“We want to get back open as soon as possible.”While the Cabinet will meet later this week to set dates for the future reopening of hospitality and international travel, a further Cabinet meeting next week on June 1st will consider the issue of financial supports for the hardest-hit sectors, including pubs.Ministers are keen to see additional supports extended to pubs such as enhanced grants for the supply of outdoor furniture.It comes after Minister for Tourism Catherine Martin said that pilot live events of varying sizes will take place across the country in June and July, including rock, classical and comedy gigs, as well both indoor and outdoor theatre events.

Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko: Strategically, the timing of the incident is deeply risky, as EU leaders can co-ordinate a response on Monday. Photograph: Pavel OrlovskiyEPABelarusian autocrat Alexander Lukashenko’s timing in forcing down a Ryanair flight to seize a journalist who was on board has provided European Union foreign policy with a make-or-break moment.A false bomb threat and the escort of a Belarusian fighter plane forced the flight from Athens to land before it could reach its destination in Lithuania. One passenger was the 26-year-old dissident reporter Roman Protasevich, who had claimed asylum in the EU after exposing Belarusian regime brutality.He panicked as the flight began to descend to Minsk and told those around him that he would be executed, fellow passengers recall. His 23-year-old girlfriend Sofia Sapega, a student, was also detained, according to Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.The audacious act happened on the evening before a meeting of the 27 EU national leaders in Brussels. The timing and the shocking nature of the incident compelled the issue to the top of the leaders’ agenda.Strategically, the timing is deeply risky for Lukashenko. He has created the momentum, and the opportunity, for the 27 to quickly agree a tough response.Austria’s deputy ambassador to the EU Gregor Schusterschitz likened it to Napoleon Bonaparte’s mistake of returning from exile in Elba in 1815 at a moment when the great powers were gathered at the Congress of Vienna – “allowing them to co-ordinate swiftly their effective response”.Even the EU’s staunchest supporters agree this is a moment when the bloc badly needs to prove its foreign policy works, or even exists at all.Hungary’s roleForeign policy decisions require a unanimous agreement by the 27 member states. Elusive at the best of times, this configuration has been banjaxed by persistent Hungarian vetoes.Budapest’s pugnacious prime minister Viktor Orban has repeatedly wielded his veto to do favours for fellow authoritarians. He prevented a joint EU call for an Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire last week and blocked a statement of support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong the week before that, to name only the most recent interventions.As the leaders converge in the EU capital all eyes are now on the Hungarian delegation to see if Orban strikes again.If not, a number of options for EU responses are on the table. The most likely one is more sanctions. The EU has already imposed successive rounds of asset freezes and travel bans on top officials including Lukashenko for a 2020 election widely viewed as rigged to maintain his 26-year reign, and in response to the subsequent brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protesters.Aviation agreementsAnother option is to suspend international aviation agreements that allow flights to enter or leave Belarusian air space, halting air traffic. This has been called for in a joint appeal by the heads of the parliamentary foreign affairs committees of Ireland, the United States, Britain, Germany, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, who described the incident as an “act of piracy” that “put the passengers and crew in grave danger”.This is not cost-free for the EU – the avoidance of conflict zones and difficult air space to the east already adds many miles to passenger flights in Europe.But the idea has a certain neatness and has significant support as a targeted response.The incident has quickly come to be seen as test case for the EU’s foreign policy, and a swift and stern response is seen as essential in order for the EU’s foreign policy to retain credibility.The strength of statements that emerged overnight, with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen calling it “outrageous and illegal” and Minister of State for European Affairs Thomas Byrne noting he had “never seen such anger” across the EU, is a reflection of that.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"eu seals off airspace to belarusian planes after jet seizure","story":"EU leaders have agreed to close off the bloc\u0027s airspace to Belarusian planes, while also banning EU planes from Belarus\u0027 airspace, following the forced landing of a Ryanair plane in Minsk to seize a dissident journalist.

Photograph:  Wojtek RadwanskiAFP via Getty ImagesThe European Union has agreed to impose fresh sanctions on Minsk and seal off its airspace to Belarusian airlines after the regime of autocrat Alexander Lukashenko forced the landing of a Ryanair flight to seize a dissident journalist who was aboard.The 27 national leaders appealed for the “immediate” release of Roman Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega in joint conclusions as they met in Brussels to co-ordinate a response to an incident described by Ryanair as “an act of aviation piracy”.The jet bound for Lithuania was erted by a bomb threat – an explanation dismissed as “completely implausible” by German Chancellor Angela Merkel – and accompanied by a fighter plane to the Belarusian capital Minsk, where the couple were removed and detained by authorities.Sapega’s university in Vilnius called for the 23-year-old student to be released, while pro-Lukashenko channels released a video of Pratasevich in which the prominent opposition reporter appeared visibly bruised and confessed to instigating unrest.In a joint agreement on Monday night the national leaders said they “strongly condemn the forced landing”, called on EU-based airlines to avoid flying over Belarus, and stated that the country’s airlines should be excluded from EU airspace and airports.TargetedThey called on the International Civil Aviation Organisation to investigate the “unprecedented and unacceptable incident”, and instructed EU officials to draw up a new list of iniduals and entities in Belarus to be targeted for fresh sanctions. The leaders also expressed solidarity with Latvia, after its diplomats were booted from Belarus in tit-for-tat expulsions.Taoiseach Micheál Martin described the incident as reflecting the erosion of democratic norms.“I think it reflects a growing authoritarianism, in the globe, near to Europe, and countries who espouse democratic values and international rules of engagement have to stand up to this type of behaviour,” he told journalists.An EU official said agreement had been reached “very quickly” and that the response was due to the “serious endangering of aviation safety and passengers on board by Belarusian authorities”.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen predicted that the ultimate sanctions would fall on iniduals involved in the incident, on businesses that finance the Lukashenko regime, and on the aviation sector.Ahead of the conference, at which the member states were also to discuss the EU’s relationship with Russia, response to Covid-19 and plans to combat climate change, a string of leaders condemned the forced landing.Reflecting an atmosphere of ill-trust, electronic devices were removed from the room “to ensure the confidentiality of the discussion on Belarus and on Russia”, a spokesman for European Council president Charles Michel said.CrackdownThe act by the regime of Lukashenko – a pariah in the West since the alleged rigging of an election in 2020 to preserve his 26-year reign and a subsequent brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protests – drew condemnation around the world.Britain’s transport secretary Grant Shapps ordered airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace and revoked the permit of national airline Belavia, while White House secretary Jen Psaki declared: “We are outraged.”European commissioner Vera Jourova described it as an “act of terror” while Lithuanian president Gitanas Nauséda said Belarusian airspace was now “unsafe”.Airlines including Latvia’s airBaltic and Scandinavian’s SAS said they would cease using Belarusian airspace, while Ukraine and Lithuania banned flights to and from the country.Belarusian officials claimed the plane was forced to land due to a bomb threat from the Palestinian group Hamas.Fellow passengers recalled a panic-striken Pratasevich telling those around him he would be executed as he realised the flight was being erted to Minsk. The Belarus regime had placed him on a terrorism watchlist and accused him of crimes related to the pro-democracy protests, seen by Minsk and Moscow as a western-orchestrated plot to end Mr Lukashenko’s rule.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Politics latest news: Government accused of imposing \u0026#39lockdown lite through the back door\u0026#39 on Indian variant hotspots  Covid lockdown roadmap: what are the latest rules as restrictions continue to easeAnalysis: The EU finally manages to pass a foreign policy testGeorge Floyd: Joe Biden to host murdered black man\u0026#39s family on anniversary of his deathMapped: The hotspots for the Indian variant of Covid-19 in the UKWho is next on the list for Covid vaccines - and how will I be invited to book an appointment?Astrazeneca Covid vaccine Q\u0026ampA: What we know about blood clots, side effects and risks A day in the life of Joe Biden: Orange Gatorade and chocolate cookies fuelling world’s most powerful manBLM activist Sasha Johnson was shot in garden by \u0026#39four black men\u0026#39, police sayMartin Bashir has not been sacked by the BBC and is still being paidScotland lockdown roadmap: Latest rules and restrictions for Scottish council areasEU cuts air links with Belarus over forced plane landing as Roman Protasevich appears \u0026#39under duress\u0026#39Tuesday morning UK news briefing: Vaccines are not the end of quarantineSeveral people found dead in Ohio shootingThe future may be bright for Hamas after winning the propaganda warComment: How Cambridge is being turned into Xi’s China‘Boomerang generation’ keep coming back to live with parentsChild mental illness now ‘more severe’ due to pandemic delaysChopper’s Politics: How do we keep Britain great?Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"max mosley ministry truth","story":"There was a revealing moment in an interview Max Mosley gave to Channel 4 a little over two years ago when, confronted with a racist leaflet published by him, and whose very existence he had previously denied under oath, he was asked whether he had perjured himself. “That’s a very offensive suggestion which you shouldn’t make,” he shot back. The premise for the question was itself “stupid”. This was the Mosley modus operandi: ignore the unpleasant facts staring you in the face challenge instead the basis on which those facts might be relayed. It was the tactic deployed when in 2008 he sued The News of the World for reporting his involvement in a sadomasochistic orgy, in which he had whipped prostitutes dressed in striped pyjamas while counting in German. It was the tactic deployed ever after in an attempt to scrub the record books of the detail that such an orgy had even taken place. Whether belly-aching about privacy or data protection, the reality was that Mosley – who died of cancer on Sunday, aged 81 – wanted to manage and control information, and not just new information, but the historic record too. When it came to the slate of what had and hadn’t happened, he thought he should be the one to wield both chalk and eraser. No wonder some lawyers watched his behaviour with wide-eyed amazement. “In terms of using the law, this is entirely novel,” Mark Stephens, a senior partner and media lawyer at Howard Kennedy said in 2018 as Mosley attempted to thrash the media into excising all traces of the orgy. “Effectively people will be able to airbrush history.”To most people the very attempt to whip, truss and dominate reality in this way would have been outlandish, if not outrageous. But to Mosley it was entirely natural. He revealed to journalists for this newspaper that his predilection for  sadomasochistic sex had begun in his childhood – “The interest started when my age was still in single figures” – yet hid it from his wife and friends. He gave interviews, yet demanded complete approval over the final text. It was as though he thought he could mould and manage truth and perception, replacing the former with the latter. As the son of Britain’s most notorious fascist, Sir Oswald Mosley, who as late as 1956 had sprayed London walls with the lightning flash symbol that featured on the armbands of both his father’s party and the SS, such autocratic fantasies were perhaps inevitable. To the end of his life he aimed to make the world around him a prop to his propaganda. Unfortunately for him, it refused to submit when he asked it to bend over.Instead it was a supreme irony that the man who had campaigned in the 1960s under the banner “Free Speech for Fascists” became himself the standard bearer for those who dream of regulating out of existence every detail of free speech that irks or inconveniences them. It brought him into curious allegiance with many from the liberal arts establishment who themselves have campaigned on similar grounds. Like the masks of comedy and tragedy that adorn so many West End curtains, the fascist’s son and the thespians became two ends of the same pursuit. Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader under Jeremy Corbyn whose office Mosley funded to the tune of half a million pounds, and fellow champion of press regulation, found himself declaring: “I’m proud to call Max Mosley a friend and I’m delighted he has made a financial contribution to Labour.” Indeed, Mosley went so far as to pursue Google in the courts merely for returning articles about the basement-flat S\u0026ampM orgy in response to search engine enquiries. The very act of seeking information, even about events which no one disputed had occurred, was to him unacceptable. It is on these grounds, perhaps beyond all others, that it is hard to forget his past. Mosley always said that he would have preferred to pursue a career in politics were it not for the fact of his family history. He insisted that motor racing, where he made his career, was a blissful escape from the tainted legacy of his father, who as the leader of the British Union of Fascists (BUF) was interned during the war (in which he clamoured for Britain to sue for peace with Germany). Cars, Max said, allowed him not so much to make his name, as to forget it. But that is itself to forget that Max Mosley was there at his father’s side in 1962, whipping up hatred in Dalston, a working class area of London with a large Jewish population, while out campaigning at the helm of the Union Movement, a new BUF in all but name. “Jews out” went the chant as they marched. That came the year after Mosley had worked as election agent for Walter Hesketh, Union Movement candidate in Manchester’s Moss Side, itself home to a new community of West Indian immigrants. It was then that was printed the leaflet, bearing the damning words “published by Max Mosley”, with which he was confronted in 2018 on Channel 4. “Protect your jobs – coloured immigrants are forming a large pool of unemployed – they will be used to lower your living standards,” the leaflet noted. “Protect your health – there is no medical check on immigration. Tuberculosis, VD and other terrible diseases like leprosy are on the increase. Coloured immigration threatens your children’s health. “Give the coloured people a fair deal by sending them back,” it continued. Asked about it two years ago, Mosley merely responded: “I do not tolerate racism and, like most people, my political views have changed over time.”That may be so – he supported both Labour and Conservative causes in later life. But what never changed was his demagogic determination to manipulate and control what the public had a right to know. It was not enough that he should bankroll Impress, the universally derided state-backed attempt to tame and trammel the press. It was not even enough that he wanted newspapers to be barred from reporting the fact that it was his family trust’s millions that sustained the muzzling. He actually wanted the press to be forced to purge its archives of the reporting that such a link existed. By controlling the past and the present, Mosley wanted to control the future. Perhaps such Orwellian gymnastics reconcile the contradiction that Mosley himself struggled to explain – that in their youthful formation his own politics had been of the “left” even while “I agreed with my father’s ideas.” Mosley wanted his own Ministry of Truth and was prepared to spend lavishly to build it. But though his aquiline features bore the imprint of his mother, Diana, the most beautiful of the Mitford sisters, and Formula 1 felt the political charisma he had inherited from his father, the wider world was, to Mosley’s own evident bewilderment, left unmoved by his machinations. He could not understand that the public did not share his enthusiasm for zipping up the truth, any more than they shared his enthusiasm for unzipping the more recondite services of prostitutes to whom he paid thousands and declared: “it’s not that expensive”. It is one thing to lose perspective but, as he discovered, it is quite another to impose that warped perspective on others. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"school faces criticism head describes palestinian flag call","story":"Police were stationed outside a school on Monday as it faced a “barrage” of criticism after the headteacher described the Palestinian flag as a call to arms. Mike Roper, who leads Allerton Grange School, in Leeds, was forced to apologise in the wake of the comments and said external speakers with “specialist knowledge” would be invited in to give a lecture. A group of around twenty pro-Palestinian activists chanted, played music and waved Palestinian flags outside the secondary school on Monday afternoon and branded the comments “inflammatory”.Yasmin Ahmed, 30, from Leeds, who attended with husband Shaan said: The kids at that school were displaying the Palestinian flag in a peaceful way to make a statement about how they felt about what is happening over there, and to display their anger and their solidarity.The school is the second to have become embroiled in culture wars in recent months, after a religious studies teacher was suspended from Batley Grammar School, in west Yorkshire, after showing a picture of the prophet Mohammed to a class prompting protests at the school gates. For the headmaster to then issue a video saying that the Palestinian flag is a call to arms and a symbol of anti-Semitism was shocking and inflammatory.”The Palestinian flag was also draped over the school sign.West Yorkshire Police said: “Officers from the local neighbourhood policing team monitored a protest outside the school this afternoon. There were no issues.There are understood to have been tensions at the Yorkshire school last week after some pupils reportedly had lanyards bearing the Palestinian flag confiscated and posters were removed.In an attempt to defuse the situation Mr Roper held an assembly on Wednesday where he claimed the flag makes some people “feel threatened”.By using a symbol such as the Palestinian flag that message is lost because for some people they see that flag and they feel threatened, they feel unsafe and they worry because for other people that flag is seen as a call to arms and seen as a message of support for anti-Semitism, for being anti-Jewish, and it was never meant to be like that in the first place,” Mr Roper said in his speech.A clip of the assembly – which was being live-streamed due to Covid-19 – was then shared on social media with some claiming his comments were “blatant Islamophobia”.Activist Fatima Said tweeted: “This is actually wild, complete erasure of Palestine and blatant Islamophobia on display here”.Moazzam Begg, a former Guantanamo Bay detainee who was held in the camp for nearly three years and released without charge in 2005, said on Twitter: “Not even Apartheid… Israel says that” about the Palestinian flag.While Ross Greer, Scottish green party MSP, posted: Imagine being a Palestinian kid at this guy\u0027s school, being told your national flag is inherently hateful. Absolutely outrageous and racist behaviour from someone in a position of power.A petition has now been launched calling for Mr Roper’s “instant resignation” which had around 300 signatories by Monday evening. However, it is unclear if the person who launched it is associated with the school.“He has caused concern and alarm within the Muslim community due to his extremist views and has caused distress, upset and anger within the surrounding Muslim community,” the petition read.  It is understood some parents are in support of the headteacher, who joined the school in 2015, and have accepted his apology.One parent, who did not want to be named, told The  she hoped Mr Roper “doesn’t lose his job over this as he has changed the school so much from what it was”.It is understood the protest was organised after a flier advertising the demonstration was shared in local pro-Palestinian Facebook groups. It comes as tensions over the conflict in Israel and Palestine has spilled out in the UK.The FA has been accused of double standards when it comes to flying to Palestinian and Israeli flags, after Tottenham Hotspur fans were told to remove an Israeli flag last week.However, Leicester players Hamza Choudhury and Wesley Fofana have been told they will not face any action after flying the Palestinian flag at Wembley.Activists protesting Israel’s attacks on Gaza were filmed driving through north-west London apparently shouting anti-Semitic abuse last week.The politan Police confirmed four men were arrested and bailed in connection with a video.It also comes just months after a religious studies teacher was suspended from Batley Grammar School, in west Yorkshire, after showing a picture of the prophet Mohammed.The teacher was forced to go into hiding after protesters gathered at the school calling for him to be sacked. In a letter to parents on Sunday night, Mr Roper said he was “deeply sorry” for the “upset” his comment had caused within the community.For those of you who have witnessed the social media barrage against the school this weekend, I am sorry for any distress this has caused you or your family, the school wrote on social media.He joined the school in 2015 and introduced a formal uniform and behaviour code in a bid to raise standards. On the first day of the new policy around 50 students were sent home for failing to meet the new uniform requirements.However, Mr Roper has overseen the school’s improvement during his tenure. In 2017 it was rated as “requires improvement” by Ofsted, which was raised to “good” just three years later.The 2020 Ofsted report described the school as multicultural and stated pupils enjoy the ersity.The religious makeup of the local area, Moortown, north-east Leeds, was majority Christian (49 per cent) in the last Census, following by 8.2 per cent Muslim, 5.4 per cent Sikh, 4.6 per cent Jewish and 2.7 per cent Hindu.School staff were stationed outside the gates on Monday morning to escort students into the building amid reports of planned protests. The school said it had been working with Leeds City Council throughout the weekend regarding the “unrest”.One parent told The  protesters were trying to get pupils to join in the demonstration as they left, minibuses were blocked and some children didn’t know their way home as they had to leave from a different exit. The council said they had received no such reports.The parent said only around 40 seconds of the five minute speech had been shared on Twitter and the school was “very erse in all races and religions”.  An 18-year-old student, who finished sixth form at the school on Friday, said although people have the right to be angry over the headteacher’s comments the protest left her younger sibling “visibly upset”.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"secret happiness tw0w1j1ttjcrjw2j1ttjevjw3j1ttjrpej","story":"Scientists trying to discover the equation for happiness have worked out that it amounts to:However, constantly belittling your own expectations can be counterproductive as it can make you more unhappy as you wait for an event that you might be looking forward to.Professor Rutledge explained: “If you make plans to catch up with a friend after work, you may be unhappy if they suddenly cancel. Another factor is how you adjust to experiencing a happy event. “Another lesson from our smartphone games is that most events don’t affect happiness for long,” said Professor Rutledge“You might think that there is something wrong with you if you don’t feel lasting happiness about a promotion, but time-limited joy is an adaptation that helps your brain adjust to your circumstances so you are ready to make your next move. “In uncertain environments, including both games and real life, what happened minutes ago is often irrelevant to the task at hand.“The ephemeral nature of happiness means we might be better off thinking about happiness in a different way.

Not only did Matthew Parris, one of Stonewall’s founders, criticise their foray ‘into the trans rights war’ but they lost a key relationship with the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).This is not a minor blip in the culture wars it is the beginning of a reckoning against the woke authoritarianism that has gripped British institutions. For the past 20 years Stonewall has invited organisations to join its Diversity Champions scheme, whereby members pay a fee and allow the charity to vet their internal policies. The 850 signed-up include the Ministry of Justice and Cabinet Office.But this weekend it was revealed the EHRC will not be renewing their membership a blow for Stonewall which trades on its image as the equality expert. A letter from EHRC chairwoman Baroness Falkner stated membership of the scheme “had no influence on external work” and that the decision not to renew membership was purely financial. But the news follows increasing public disquiet about the role of Stonewall in shaping policies which critics argue undermine existing sex-based rights and penalise those who refuse to accept that ‘transwomen are women.’Last week saw the publication of the Reindorf Report, an independent investigation into the no-platforming of feminist academics by the University of Essex. Professors Phoenix and Freedman were disinvited from speaking due to preconceptions about their views on transgender people. Along with 120 other universities, University of Essex is a Stonewall Diversity Champion.The report was damning, noting the university had adopted policies which reflected “the law as Stonewall would prefer it to be, rather than the law as it is.” Significantly, it advised that should the university continue with its membership of the Stonewall scheme it “devise a strategy for countering the drawbacks and potential illegalities.” Stonewall’s problems can be traced to the appointment of Ruth Hunt in 2014.Having won the fight for same sex marriage, there was nowhere to progress for lesbian, gay and bisexual equality. Following a consultation with 700 trans people, in 2015 Stonewall accepted a donation to ‘integrate trans-specific work’ into its campaigns. In 2019 Hunt left Stonewall and accepted a peerage.There is no link between people who identify as trans and those who are same-sex attracted the addition of the ‘T’ to the ‘LGB’ was more about funding than facts. Today Stonewall promotes the notion that each of us has a ‘gender identity’ and that this might not align with our sexed bodies. By doing so Stonewall opened the ideological door to the concept of ‘lesbians with penises’ and ‘gay men with vulvas.’ Unsurprisingly, many lesbians and gay men have objected to this idea.Simon Fanshawe OBE was one of Stonewall’s founders he believes the charity has strayed from its core purpose and that it is now “entirely devoted to political conformity.” “Stonewall is no longer an advisor and campaigner on lesbian and gay equality. Instead, it has set itself up as the arbiter of who is the right kind of gay. It’s tells any gay man or lesbian who does not agree with its gender ideology that they have put themselves \u0027outside Stonewall\u0027.”Fanshawe is far from alone in his criticism of Stonewall. Allison Bailey is a lesbian barrister with concerns about the embedding of gender ideology in institutions. Bailey alleges that Stonewall colluded with her employer to remove her and is suing both.On Monday 24 May, in an attempt to deflect from negative coverage Stonewall launched a new strategy with the strapline ‘Free to be.’ But there is no freedom for gay men like Simon Fanshawe or lesbians like Allison Bailey to be critical of gender ideology. Having undermined its foundations by alienating same-sex attracted people, it seems Stonewall may finally be about to fall.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"submarine telegram 1851 thought worlds first goes hammer","story":"The message was transmitted across 25 nautical miles of copper wire carried across the English Channel from South Foreland, in Kent, to Calais.It reads: PRINTED-FROM-ENGLAND-TO-FRANCE-SEPT-28-1851-6-P-M. The piece of paper, complete with a scrapbook of information and cuttings about the breakthrough moment, is being sold by a private collector and is expected to fetch up to £5,000 on Tuesday. It is a tiny slip of paper, and the only way it survived is because the original recipient placed it into an album.This telegram sits right at the beginning of communication between nations and across the sea, signalling a really important moment.They founded the Submarine  Company with the goal of taking the technology international. Using their familial wealth, they mounted an experimental attempt to connect Calais and Dover on August 28, 1850, and it was a partial success.The flimsy cable laid across the seabed soon broke, but not before it had enabled a message to be sent from England to France.The messages were severely distorted and only a garbled, indecipherable jumble of characters was transmitted, but the proof of concept was enough to garner worldwide attention and allow the brothers to secure further funding.This allowed a more robust cable to be built which would not only survive for longer, but would maintain the integrity of the original message.The next expedition, on September 25, featured this iron-clad copper cable, which was able to protect against saltwater and rogue fishing ships, which had both scuppered previous attempts. However, the brothers had underestimated how much cable was needed to be able to cross the channel and their 25 nautical miles of insulated copper left them more than a mile adrift off the French coast. The cable was laid across the sea bed, which makes it not so strange that they ran out of cable as there are unknown metrics and undulations to contend with, Dr Heaton told The . The technology was so experimental that they went out to sea and realised they were a couple of miles short and ran out of cable. They had this fairly good quality cable within two miles of Calais and then they had to jerry rig the last stretch to the shore with a substandard substitute.The telegram up for auction was sent two days after the cable was completed along this spliced line, and before the final stretch was upgraded about a month later.An official opening of the international submarine telegram network was held on November 19, 1851, when the line was open for public use. The blueprint created by the Submarine  Company\u0027s submarine system was used to create the transatlantic version which sent its first messages in 1858.The item is being sold as part of a collection at Sotheby\u0027s auction house, starting on Tuesday at 2pm.Other lots available include a signed letter from Albert Einstein to his son, a signed letter from Charles Darwin to the prominent 19th century zoologist Enrico Giglioli and an autograph by the late Stephen Hawking, dated to 1979.The day of science-oriented items also includes work relating to Alexander von Humbolt, Johannes Kepler, Nicolaus Copernicus, Louis Pasteur and Mary Anning.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"analysis eu finally manages pass foreign policy test","story":"The diplomats and officials that stuff the corridors of power in Brussels breathed a sigh of relief on Monday night. After a string of high profile failures, the EU had finally passed a foreign policy test. The “hijacking” of the Ryanair flight by the Belarusian government, and the arrest of a journalist on a flight between two European capitals full of EU citizens, demanded a severe response. EU leaders ordered new sanctions against Minsk officials and state-owned companies. They demanded the immediate release of Roman Protasevich, an exiled opposition journalist arrested on the erted flight, and his partner, Sofia Sapega. A French plan to block ground transit links with Belarus did not get the necessary support but the heads of state and governments closed Belarusian airspace and banned Belarus airlines from EU airports.In February,  the bloc’s chief diplomat was publicly humiliated at a Moscow press conference. He was peppered with planted questions about Cuba as opposition leader Alexei Navalny faced new charges in a Russian court. In April, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, was hung out to dry by Charles Michel, the European Council president, in what became known as ‘sofagate’. Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had provided only one chair for the two presidents and Mr Michel promptly made a beeline for it. Mrs von der Leyen was relegated to a nearby sofa in an embarrassing and sexist episode that brutally exposed the inter-institutional rivalry between Council and Commission. That disunity has long been reflected among the EU’s 27 member states and explains why officials often describe the bloc’s foreign policy as a work in progress or “in its teens”. There have  been plenty of growing pains since the EU’s foreign affairs service was set up in December 2010. Just six days ago Hungary vetoed an anodyne EU statement calling on both Israel and the Palestinians to implement a ceasefire in Gaza. Budapest has form when it comes to blocking EU statements criticising countries such as Russia and China. It is able to do so because most EU foreign policy decisions require the unanimous support of all member states, which can leave Brussels at the mercy of the whim of a single, small member state. In 2016, the EU could not agree sanctions against Russia for the bombing of Aleppo, despite France, Germany and the UK pushing for the measures, because Italy was against it.There is little sign of member countries being willing to sacrifice their veto, despite a long mooted push to replace unanimity with a majority vote.Since Brexit, the EU has called for a “geopolitical Europe” that would finally begin to punch its weight globally, thanks in part to a new found “strategic autonomy”.The forced landing of the Ryanair flight was a direct challenge to this idea of a “Europe that protects” and prevents its citizens being squeezed in the race for the future between the US and China. “This is an attack on European sovereignty,” Mrs von der Leyen said after the summit. Britain imposed sanctions on Belarus for election rigging last year long before the EU was able to. The UK announced its own flight bans before last night’s summit. The EU will always be slower than a single country in imposing sanctions, when they can be agreed, but can carry more heft. It is a delicate balancing act to keep all 27 member states, who have different interests, on board, which is why the clear political direction from leaders last night is so important.Much will depend on the severity of the sanctions when they are drawn up. Previous measures have had little impact on the Lukashenko regime, which is supported by cheap Russian loans and energy. But for now the EU has succeeded in sending out a strong, clear and unified signal.Failure to do that again would have left it looking toothless and useless.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cambridge turned xis china","story":"On Sunday, I studied the website of Report+Support, a new “reporting tool” offered to students by Cambridge University by the vice-chancellor, Professor Stephen Toope. It is based on a template already used by some other universities. It invites you to denounce anyone you like in the university for “racism, discrimination and micro-aggressions”.The media have already reported the list of “micro-aggressions” provided. One is “raising eyebrows when a black member of staff or student is speaking”. Others are “referring to a woman as a ‘girl’” and making “backhanded compliments”.It is impossible not to laugh, but one should not doubt the seriousness of the operation. Prof Toope, who has made repeated speeches in praise of Xi Jinping’s China, is developing methods of denunciation of which the People’s Republic would be proud.There are two ways in which you can accuse people, says the Cambridge website. The university authorities provide a secure collection point and promise to act on what you tell them: you can “report anonymously” or “report with contacts”. If you do the former, you can give the name of the person you are accusing but neither that person nor the authorities will ever know your name or be able to check the truth of your claim.Thus you could allege that anyone – let us say Prof Toope himself – had committed the micro-aggression of “asking a black person if that is their ‘natural’ hair”. If you did so, this would be put on Prof Toope’s file and could be used against him at any time. The opportunities for malice are limitless. They are scarcely less so if you “report with contacts”, giving your name in confidence: you would still be free to denounce Prof Toope’s supposed racism or sexism, secure in the knowledge that you could injure him, but he could never know that it was you who did so. And by the way, even if it was not your hair on which Prof Toope commented micro- aggressively, but that of a third party, you could still report it, without consulting that person first. This process is the web equivalent of the ancient habit of sticking pins in the effigy of someone you hate.I wonder if these procedures are compatible with the Data Protection Act. I know they are incompatible with that basic principle of justice: the presumption of innocence.Perhaps even more extraordinary is the definition of racism with which Report + Support begins. Here it is, in full: “Racism is a system of oppression, woven into the fabric of societies, institutions, processes, procedures, people’s values, beliefs, attitudes and behaviour. It is a system of advantage that sets whiteness as the norm, manifesting in societies’ valuing and promoting (implicitly or explicitly) being white. It is a system where people from racially minoritised backgrounds are more likely than white people to face multiple obstacles in life, from being targets of direct or indirect discrimination and micro-aggressions.” Racism, in short, is a strictly white phenomenon. Prof Toope, and whoever wrote the definition for him, seem unaware that such a view must itself be racist.A further consequence of this doctrine is that white people persecuting other white people are not racists. As a Jewish friend says to me, a little grimly, “The idea that you can’t be racist against white people (because they are already part of the ‘norm’) will be of great comfort to my relatives who were suffocated to death at Auschwitz.”By the same logic, I suppose, black people cannot be racist towards other black people, so Shona killings of Ndebele or Hutu killings of Tutsis must be attributable to something else.In a nutshell, a white man running a great university has decided that his own skin colour is intrinsically bad. “Whiteness” is prima facie evidence of racism - almost a micro-aggression in itself - inevitably giving rise to “inappropriate behaviour”, which must be reported.To assist him in his task, Prof Toope recently appointed Dr Nicola Rollock as his Special Adviser on Race. She is one of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s Next Generation Trailblazers. Her first book, The Racial Code, will be published later this year. Perhaps it was she who provided Prof Toope with his tragi-comic examples.Yesterday, there was a new development. The Report + Support website was taken down. Eventually the Vice-Chancellor put out a statement saying that “certain ancillary material” had been “included in error” because it went “beyond the approved policy framework”. That material would now be removed. At the time of writing, we wait eagerly to learn which item of this list is not micro-aggressive and which isn’t. The difference will provide an interesting insight into Toopist thought.A revolt is brewing. At the end of last year, Cambridge academics decisively rejected a definition of free speech pushed on them by Prof Toope. He wanted it to include “respect” for views with which one disagrees - a demand which, when you think about it, is often impossible. Led by an able young philosopher, Arif Ahmed, they replaced the word “respect” with “tolerance”, and prevailed.Fired by this experience, the rebels now have an active nucleus, hundreds-strong. Their leaders are meeting this week to concert resistance and, if necessary, a legal challenge.

The information was posted in an online update at Gov.uk last weekbut it does not appear to have been accompanied by an official announcement.This reportedly sparked confusion among local leaders in Bolton who claimed they were not told about the guidance. It states that journeys to and from areas affected by the Indian iant throughout the UK should be avoided, aposunless essentialapos. Exemptions include work -you cannot work from home - and education.

It also suggests people in those areas meet outside rather than inside where possible and keep  metres apart from people they don’t live with. The Government recommends people in areas affected by the new strain should get tested twice a week, work from homepossible and take the vaccine when it is offered.Bolton is currently the UKaposs worst Covid hotspot, with an infection rate of . cases per , residents - a week on week rise of  percent.  Blackburn with Darwen has the second highest rate with . cases, followed by Bedford, Kirklees, Rossendale, Burnley, Hyndburn, Bury and Manchester. Leicester comes th on the list, with Hounslow th and North Tyneside th. Bolton has suffered a surge in cases of the Indian coronavirus iant, raising fears the town could be placed on lockdown.Local leaders and health bosses in Bolton were reportedly unaware of the new Government guidance, according to the Manchester Evening News.  The guidance affecting Bolton has come to light as data shows coronavirus-related hospital admissions have jumped to  in the borough. It is believed  patients are currently being treated for the virus at the Royal Bolton Hospital - the highest figure in two months. Lever Edge in Bolton currently has the highest infection rate in the UK, with . cases per , people. The new government guidance states: “The new Covid- iant spreads more easily from person to person. To help stop the spread, you should take particular caution when meeting anyone outside your household or support bubble.  “In the areas listed, wherever possible, you should try to meet outside rather than inside where possible, keep two metres apart from people that you don’t live with . This includes friends and family you don’t live with, [and] avoid travelling in and out of affected areas unless it is essential, for example for workor education.”Despite the rise in coronavirus cases in Bolton over the past few weeks, infection rates are not believed to have had a signicant impact on hospital admissions until the last few days. The MEN understands there are currently  patients being treated for the virus at the Royal Bolton Hospital, with ten more people admitted since yesterday . This is the highest figure since March, when case rates across the region were in the process of falling following a spike early in the year. Two deaths related to Covid- were recorded at the Royal Bolton NHS Trust last week, bringing the total number of those who have lost their lives to the virus in Bolton up to . Over the same period there was one other death recorded in Greater Manchester, by Salford Royal NHS Trust. At the height of the pandemic last year, there were six wards at the Royal Bolton turned over to coronavirus patients, with as many as  people being treated there. Doctors had been able to reduce that figure to just one ward and were beginning to restart non-urgent procedures when the latest spike in cases hit.

Campaigners led by the footballer want three key planks of the National Food Strategy brought into force. The petition which sparked tonightaposs Westminster Hall debate read: “Government should support vulnerable children and #endchildfoodpoverty by implementing  recommendations from the National Food Strategy to expand access to Free School Meals, provide meals  activities during holidays to stop holiday hunger and increase the value of and expand the Healthy Start scheme.”Like news  Get the best of the dayaposs updates by signing up the Mirroraposs email newsletterBacked by the Child Food Poverty Taskforce, the petition called for money to widen free school meals to all under-s where a parent orreceives Universal Credit or an equivalent benefit, provide meals and activities during all school holidays, and increase the value of Healthy Start vouchers to at least £. per week, and expand the scheme.As politicians tussled for  minutes in Parliament, frustrated Marcus urged MPs to get on with helping kids. He tweeted: “It’s confusing that we are debating the implementation of government-commissioned findings. Gov did the research. Gov gathered the data.  “And solutions were formed from that . I endorsed them…so what’s to debate  Let’s discuss the findings and discuss the solutions.” Supporters of the blueprint believe adopting the three recommendations will help ease the plight of . million British children living in relative poverty, defined as being less than % of average household income The Mirror has told how foodbank demand rocketed by a third in the  months to April as Trussell Trust centres handed out nearly  million meals.  The charityaposs outlets gave away ,, emergency parcels – and with each package containing enough food for three meals a day for three days, it means the Trust provided ,, meals. Nearly a million parcels went to children, meaning ,, kidsapos meals were provided. Labour MPs blamed the Tories for fuelling child poverty. Shadow Minister Tulip Siddiq said: “More families than ever are having to rely on foodbanks to feed their children. “This food poverty is a result of poverty itself, which has been rising dramatically since . “Rising levels of child poverty are a direct result of policy choices over the last decade.” Labouraposs Grahame Morris said: “This is the defining issue of our time. “Itaposs not some happenstance that so many children have been driven into poverty. “This is the result of Government policies.” But Conservative backbencher Jerome Mayhew blamed family breakdown and drug-taking for some households being mired in poverty – and urged parents to take responsibility for their kids.  “As a parent myself, one of the key le lessons I try to give my own children is that of personal responsibility,” he said. “Reasons for childhood hunger are complex and it will hamper our ability properly to address those causeswe choose for political or campaigning reasons to over-simply them. “They include unemployment, a sudden change of family income, chaotic finances, drug dependency, poor access to good quality food shops, poor food education, the breakdown of relationships and low pay in employment.” Education Minister Vicky Ford said the Government had increased Healthy Start vouchersapos value to £. a week and was providing holiday activities and free school meals out of term time this year. “This Government is dedicated to supporting those children and families, especially the most vulnerable and the Government is fully considering all the recommendations of the National Food Strategy,” she said. “We will respond more fully following the next and final report which is due in the summer.” MPs also called for a £-a-week rise in Universal Credit, which boosts six million familiesapos incomes by £,-a year, to be extended. It was introduced at the start of the pandemic but is due to be axed from September.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnChannel Trussell TrustMarcus RashfordPoliticspovertyChild Poverty"},{"url":null,"title":"tory says new covid rules","story":"NewsTory says new Covid rules in hotspots clear - then refuses to give travel adviceThe Government has been accused of incompetence after it quietly published guidance against non-essential travel for places hit by the Indian iantmirrorShareCommentsByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video therese-coffey-defends-covid-guidance-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:LMRqzadx,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeLocal leaders have sounded the alarm after Government travel guidance in a string of Covid hotspot areas was quietly changed. Thousands of people living in eight places, including Leicester, Kirklees, North Tyneside and the London borough of Hounslow, have been advised not to travel in or out of their areas to except for essential reasons. The guidance, which also applies in Bedford and Burnley, was changed on Friday - but local leaders appear to have been left in the dark. Advice against travel into and out of Bolton, in Greater Manchester, and Blackburn with Darwen, in Lancashire, was issued on May . Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said she was surprised people think this has come out of the blue - despite no formal announcement being made. She also failed to give a clear answer on whether people in these areas should travel abroad - but urged them to considerholidays are essential.  But Professor Dominic Harrison, director of public health for Blackburn with Darwen, said he had not been told there were new rules for his area. He tweeted: #localgov areas involved were not consulted with, warned of, notied about, or alerted to this guidance. I have asked to see the national risk assessment which supports this action - it has not been provided to us yet. North Tynesideaposs director of public health, Wendy Burke, said she had not been given indication of new restrictions when an announcement about extra testing was made last week. She said: Last Wednesday it was announced in Parliament that North Tyneside, along with five other areas in England, would be subject to enhanced testing and vaccinations. When the announcement was made there was no indication it would come with any additional restrictions for North Tyneside or the other areas.  We understand that, later, Government guidance around travel in and out of North Tyneside was posted on the Government website. This has not been accompanied by any communication to the local authority, local residents or businesses. We have already queried this with the Department of Health and Social Care to seek clarication.Yasmin Qureshi, Labour MP for Bolton South East, said: I was not informed of this and I understand nor was anyone  in Bolton.Iaposm just gobsmacked. Theyaposre making such an important announcement and they donapost even have the decency to tell us or tell our constituents. This is typical of this Governmentaposs incompetence. But Ms Coffey tried to claim that the guidance was merely confirming Boris Johnsonaposs advice to the public on May  that caution was necessary due to spikes of the Indian iant.  She told Sky News: The Prime Minister set out that we need to take extra caution in certain areas regarding the Indian iant. It is good practice to formally put that guidance on the record affecting those communities. We have been working in close contact, so Iaposm surprised to hear that people think this has come out of the blue - it hasnapost. It is about formalising on the record the guidance which we believe people can and should follow in order to make sure we tackle and donapost have more spread of the Indian iant. Ms Coffey said people living in hotspot areas should also consider whether it really is essential to travel abroad.  Askeda family from Bolton should go ahead with half-term holiday plans abroad, she said: Iaposm not going to give inidual travel guidance on some hypothetical situations to people in dferent parts of the country. The guidance is very clear that people need to consider whether it really is essential. Iaposm conscious that the green list is there, it is there for a purpose because we recognise the amount of transmission in that country is very low, so the risks of bringing the iant back into the UK are very low, and thataposs why we have the process that we have. But I think people just need to consider carefully the risks that they are under themselves.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnConservative PartyPoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"astronauts moon able use whatsapp","story":"NewsAstronauts on moon will be able to use WhatsApp and Netflix thanks to British firmInmarsat is one of several UK firms tasked by the European Space Agency with creating telecommunications and a GPS navigation system for the lunar surfacemirrorShareCommentsByMartin BagotHealth and Science editor:,  MAY NewsAstronauts could WhatsApp their mates thanks to Brit boffins \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

June  is the date that temperatures will start to pick up again, forecasters say, beginning in the south and gradually rising in the first week of the month.During the mini-heatwave the mercury could rise as high as into the mid-twenties during the first few days of June, Birmingham Live reports.Kent, London and parts of the south are all braced for C heat next month - and itaposs before the  day heatwave being predicted by meteorologists from June  to July. It will be a welcome relief for Brits who have endured weeks of torrential rain and biting temperatures this month. But before the warmer weather s the country will have to endure another three days of wet and windy weather.Today, forecasters predicts yet more aposheavy showersapos and cold temperatures to blanket many parts of the country, particularly in northern England.The Met Office ’s Sarah Kent said: “It will be an unsettled start to this week with heavy, thundery showers.“But the weekend is going to be much better. “From Thursday, high pressure will bring dry weather and warmer temperatures. “The weekend looks fine and settled with higher temperatures.” Long-forecast weather charts show widespread spells of high pressure move across the UK from the Atlantic by mid-June.  Annie Shuttleworth, a meteorologist with Met Office, said: The most likely scenario at the moment is looking like predominantly dry weather, at quite a contrast to what weaposve seen with the wet weather in May, so that would be an improvement. Weaposre hoping by the end of May we will have much drier and settled weather across the UK. It comes after what could be one of the wettest Mays on record, beating the current record of .mm of rain in . UK Weather Forecast Today: Patchy rain in the north and east will be replaced by sunny spells and heavy showers - particularly for northern England. Fewer showers where with sunny spells, though rain will affect Cornwall and parts of Devon during afternoon. Remaining cool. Tonight: Showers dying out for most though a few persisting for central England and East Anglia with more rain arriving for east Scotland and northeast England. Chilly in places. Wednesday: Rain in the northeast breaking up into showers, some heavy but less so than Monday and Tuesday.

Among those landing were Luke Stevens, , and partner Elesha Bacon, , with their children Freddie, five and Mia, six months. They are starting a new le in Pinar de Campoverde with Luke’s parents Dave, , and Jacqueline, , who they have not seen for six months. The couple are emigrating to Spain where Luke is setting up Stevens and Son’s butchers in the village. Luke, a butcher since he was , and Elesha were due to fly out and meet the rest of the family before Christmas but were stranded in Great Dunmow, Essex, because of the pandemic. Are you jetting off to Spain today  let us know in the comments below...  “We’re here in the sun and we’re not going back,” said a joyous Luke. “We’re emigrating - I’ve set up a shop out here, it’s all sorted. “We signed the lease over last year but couldn’t get back out because of the virus.” Emotional Dave, , said: “It’s great to see them all, it’s been six months and it feels even longer.” Lorraine Swettenham, , from Cleveleys, Lancs, booked her flight from Manchester a month ago.  “I was hoping the Spanish restrictions would have lted by now so I purposely booked it for today,” she told the Mirror. She runs a market stall in Benidorm along with her husband George, who is joining her on June , while a pal is flying out to meet her on Sunday. “I’ve got lots to do as I haven’t been here for a long time,” she said. “But I’ll find some time to relax eventually. “It’s lovely to be back and I hope Spain is taken off the amber list soon. Why should there be a -day quarantine in place in the UKyou’ve been vaccinated  It makes no sense to me.”  Holidaymakers from the UK do not have to provide a negative test to enter Spain as of today. Flying out from Stansted this morning was Elizabeth Chapman, , from Cambridge, who was awaiting an emotional reunion with her daughter and two grandchildren in Benidorm. She has not seen them for over a year. “It does feel emotional and I’m trying to hold it together - I can’t wait to see them all and give them a hug,” she said.  “I booked on Friday when I realised Spain was opening opening up to the UK. “I’ve had both vaccinations and I tool a PCR test even though it’s not now required.” For Carole Hutchison and her partner Christopher Couper, from Fe, their reason for travel is altogether dferent. The couple had fertility treatment booked in Alicante and were in a race against time as they had to arrive at the clinic by midday. They had a taxi waiting for them at the airport for the landing shortly after am. The clinic was not defrosting the embryos until the couple told them they were on the plane and it was ready to take off.  They were due to fly from Edinburgh to Spain via Heathrow on Friday but, because of restrictions in Spain they were told they were not allowed. That is despite twice last year flying to the same clinic for treatment when the country was under Covid restrictions.

You also must have PCR tests on day two and eight afterto the UK. Carole, , a public health practitioner for the NHS, said before she boarded the flight: “It’s been incredibly stressful and we have to rush once we land at Alicante and try and get through the airport as quickly as possible. “I’ve been taking the required medication for months and there’s a window for when it can happen, we couldn’t believe we were not allowed to fly on Friday. “Ten minutes after we were told that we found out Spain was opening up from today, so we booked on this flight.  “We lost a lot of money on the flight and this is a massive relief we can get on this flight but it’s very stressful of course. “We fly straight back tomorrowto quarantine for  days.” Karen Flaun, , lives in Murcia and came back to the UK in November to see family with the intention of staying for Christmas - but had been stuck ever since. “It’s been great to spend so much time with the family but of course I’m looking forward to getting back to my home in Murcia and seeing what the house is like - and of course to get some sun.” Deli Watt, , and her husband Alexander, , from Oundle, Northamptonshire, booked three weeks ago toto their holiday home in Xatipia. “It’s a stroke of luck Spain is reopening and we happen to be on this flight. We took a chance when we booked it and it’s paid off. “We’re really looking forward to getting out there after such a tough year.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnSpainHolidays"},{"url":null,"title":"eight neighbours share 240000 lottery","story":"AdvertorialEIGHT neighbours share £, Lottery win - and reveal epic idea to celebrateThe lucky lot each won £, playing Peoples Postcode LotterymirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Advertorialthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video christina-new-tredegar-street-wins-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:EsKidV,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

They hit the jackpot after their postcode,NP LG, in the Welsh town of New Tredegar, was drawn as a big winner.And theyaposre already planning a bumper street party to celebrate the le-changing news. Among the winners are an NHS nurse, a set of relations and a winner who recently suffered heartbreak at the hands of covid. Support worker Gareth Walbeoff, , lost his father to the pandemic in January. He said: My poor mum was having to isolate for  days, so only I could go to console her, none of the other family could go. “Then she unfortunately fell and broke her back, she’s up and about now and my niece is taking her to a hospital appointment today. My niece is really good to mum, I couldn’t manage without her. She’s got three children and my nephew has a little girl as well. What I’m going to do is pay for all these kids to have a good holiday in a big -star, luxury caravan in Tenby for two weeks!  He also congratulated his neighbours and added: “In this street we all are like one big family. When it’s safe to do so we’re going to have one hell of a street party!”Gareth wasn’t the only member of his family to get a call from lottery ambassador Danyl Johnson . One of the other winners was -year-old Alan Vaughan whose partner, Nicola, is Gareth’s cousin.Another winner from the street was NHS nurse Tina Watkinswho learned of her windfall while on a break at work. As the cheque was revealed, the -year-old clapped with joy and said: “Woo!  grand! Oh that’s fantastic, thank you very much!” Her co-workers cheered on hearing the total and Tina said she would buy her manager, who was holding Tina’s camera phone over the call, ‘a nice big cake.’ Tina already had plans for some of her winnings: She added: “I’ve got a house renovation going on, so I can plough it into that and buy my son a car.

There are five food banks operating each week to feed the poor. But the Trust is determined to help give the island a leline with the new project.

Among the well-known firms which are said to have been swallowed up in private equity deals are Asda, the AA and the owner of Butlinaposs. Security company GS is also currently being sold for £.billion. The merger between GS and private-equity backed Allied Universal will create the world’s largest private security company, generating more than  billion in revenue and employing more than , security guards and other staff.  One Tory peer and ex-pensions minister was reported to have sounded a warning about the possible risks of outside companies apostaking advantageapos.The Daily Mail reports that Baroness Altmann said: It’s really important that Government and businesses are on the lookout for pandemic plunderers.Companies are in desperate trouble through no fault of their own because of Covid, and the risk is that some outside companies might take advantage of this to buy our precious assets at knockdown prices. Dame Margaret Hodge, ex-chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, reportedly said private equity had previously ‘asset-stripped good businesses and loaded them up with debts.’ Professor John Colley, a takeovers expert and associate dean of Warwick Business School, was said to have warned that private equity ownership can lead to unstable finances and management changes. Private Equity Wire reports that with the easing of lockdown restrictions this year acquisitions from private equity funds will only increase. Kyra Motley, Partner at Boodle Hatfield, said: “Successful entrepreneurs who are cash rich from exiting their own business are often driven to replicate their first success by buying and building a new business. “They’ll be looking to pick up assets in the medium-term, particularly with the huge number of distressed assets likely to come onto the market in the second half of the year as Government financial support schemes, such as furlough, come to an end.” In February Zuber and Mohsin Issa and private equity group TDR Capital completed their purchase of a majority stake in Asda from US giant Walmart in a deal valuing the chain at £.bn.

Even after the final stage of lockdown lting takes place on June , those who have had both jabs could end up in quarantine for ten daysthey come into contact with an infected person.The plans to continue the contact tracing programme, as reported by the , have been made to stop the spread of the virus.While much less likely to fall ill with the virus, vaccinated people can still pass it on. The programmes continuation is set to be announced next week, when conclusions from a review into social distancing are made public. It is expected that social distancing and face mask rules will be relaxed.

The rules dfer from those in force in America, where only people who have symptoms have to quarantinetheyaposve been jabbed. Close contact is defined as having a face-to-face conversation, being within one metre for one minute or within two metres for  minutes. The cautious approach was reported on the day that Professor Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group at the University of Oxford, suggested the pandemic could be declared overpeople are kept out of hospital by vaccines. Referring to Public Health Englanddata published at the weekend, he told BBC Radio aposs Today programme that more time was needed to see how the vaccines work in the longer-term as people build immunity.  Askedpeople may think the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine was not as good as Pfizer, according to the data, he said: Well I think in some ways weaposre looking at the wrong exam question, because this is a question about mild infection and transmission. But the thing that makes this a pandemic is people going into hospital. And so what we really need to know, and we donapost have the data yet for certain, is how well both vaccines are performing in preventing people from going into hospital.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  And what weaposve seen so far in the pandemic is that protection from vaccines against hospitalisation and death is much, much higher than the protection against mild infection, which is what these tests are detecting. So what Iaposm waiting for is the answer to that exam question, which is the critical one to understand how we should respond in the future to new iants, is to find out whether these infections that weaposre starting to see a little bit with this current iant are completely uncoupled from hospitalisations and deaths, but we just need a few more weeks to get more evidence around that.

Many were told they could not go on their pre-booked Ryanair flight to Malaga as they had no proof of Spanish residency. The paperwork, at the time, was required by the Spanish government for people to travel to the country.There were tears of frustration when they were told they could not board the plane, DerbyshireLive reports.The incident happened on Friday but from today, the requirement is no longer in place.  Spain has opened its borders to visitors from countries that have low infection rates, including Britain. A passenger from Derby, who did not wish to be named, told the website things quickly turned toxic. He said: When I arrived at the airport I was asked to go to the Ryanair gate to have my documents checked. I did not expect any issue as I had been very thorough in obtaining all the documents they required. I was met by a woman who informed people they would not be travelling unless they had a Spanish passport, proof of an application for residency or a letter from the UK Government saying the trip was essential. This led to anger, aggression and tears and three police officers had to oversee discussions. It was a truly shameful situation that caused great distress and large financial losses to some people. How we can have a validated form from the Spanish Travel Health government site allowing our entry and then be told this isnapost sufficient  This was distressing for many people.  Ryanair has all customersapos email addresses and telephone numbers so they could have contacted all passengers  hours prior to travelling, so this really is shameful and I hope it doesnapost happen to other UK travellers in the future. A spokesman for East Midlands Airport said: On Friday, May ,  passengers were refused boarding onto a flight to Malaga for not having a Spanish residency permit. The decision, taken by the airline’s handling agent, was in line with the requirements of the Spanish authorities at the time.  “We encourage anyone planning to travel overseas to familiarise themselves with what is required of both the destination country and the UK’s regulations prior to booking flights. Thousands of Brits were expected to jet to Spain today, defying Government warnings not to travel. The country remains on the “amber” list under the Department for Transport’s traffic light system, and ministers have pleaded with passengers not to fly without a valid reason.  Arrivals to the UK from amber list countries must self-isolate at home for  days and take two coronavirus tests.But after Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez throws open the doors on Monday, many lockdown-weary Brits are expected to head for the Costas anyway. Flights from the UK to Spain are set to double to around  a day this week, carrying an estimated , passengers. It means more than , tourists could be jetting to Spain over the next few days.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnRyanair"},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather met office expert","story":"NewsUK weather: Met Office expert explains why May has been so wet, cold and miserableThe May washout is down to a jet stream from Greenland, meaning it is currently the th wettest on record - but a C heatwave could be just around the cornermirrorShareCommentsByRyan MerrieldReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video met-office-national-morning-forecast-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:ILQOzBk,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

This yearaposs unusually wintry spring has inconveniently coincided with the long-awaited lting of lockdown restrictions after months spent largely indoors.The Met Office said up to Saturday the UK had seen an average of .mm of rainfall –  percent of the average for the usually dry and sunny month. This makes it the th wettest on record, with nine days still to go. Meteorologist Aidan McGivern said: “If you enjoy warm and sunny spring weather, I am guessing you have not been a fan of this May so far. “There’s no denying it’s been wet. Some places have had two times their usual total May rainfall – and that’s only up to May .  “A far cry from April, which this year was the sunniest April on record.” Although April was cold, a blocking anti-cyclone near the UK helped ert the jet stream, taking cloud and rain away. Aidan said: “May’s weather has also been down to a blocking anti-cyclone – but this time, it’s over Greenland and that helped push the jet stream to the south.”  As the dip of the jet stream lingers, low pressure moves in and mills around for several days, bringing rain. However, hope is coming as a long-awaited heatwave could well be on the cards with temperatures as high as C from June . Forecasters say the heat will begin in the south and gradually rise in the first week of the next month.  Kent, London and parts of the south are all braced for temperatures in the mid-twenties for at least the first few days of next month.Then thereaposs the possibility of a  day scorcher from June  to July, thanks to a -mile wide heat bubble, say some forecasts. John Hammond, of Weathertrending said: “Some warmer days are in the offing, with temperatures in the s.” He added the conditions would be “very pleasant”.  font-family: FSEmeric, sans-ser\"UK  day weather forecast Today: Patchy rain in the north and east will be replaced by sunny spells and heavy showers - particularly for northern England. Fewer showers where with sunny spells, though rain will affect Cornwall and parts of Devon during afternoon. Remaining cool. Tonight: Showers dying out for most though a few persisting for central England and East Anglia with more rain arriving for east Scotland and northeast England. Chilly in places. Wednesday: Rain in the northeast breaking up into showers, some heavy but less so than Monday and Tuesday. Staying dry for the west and south and turning a little warmer here. Outlook for Thursday to Saturday: Many places dry with sunny spells. Some rain likely to affect the west later on Thursday and perhaps during Friday.

Natasha Prince made the alarming discovery after an electrician began carrying out checks and tripped a switch. On closer inspection, he noticed the -year-oldaposs electricity meter had been connected to the meter for the whole communal block.This included the hallway lights and intercoms for the entire building, the Manchester Evening News reports.The alarm was raised with the housing company immediately. They say the work completed earlier at the Swinton home was not carried out by one of its contractors.  Natasha said during the mix-up she had changed electricity supplier multiple times and had even had to borrow money from her family to help pay for the bills. She said: “Initially I ended up changing my electric supplier because I thought they were charging me too much. “An electrician came out and said he tripped a switch and rang me saying he needed to gain access to the property to switch it on. “He came in and noticed these wires connected to my supply. He said I was paying for the communal areas, meaning the doors, lights and the intercoms. “They’re a -hour thing so they’re constantly on. “I’ve gone away for a week and left only the fridge freezer on, and because the flat is using the electricity for the rest of the building it will switch off. “When I topped up, the doors came back on. I could barely do any of my washing because of how much electric it was taking. “I’ve wasted so much food and come back to it flooding with water. I was constantly topping up every two days and it was draining and draining. “Now they’ve taken the box out, I’ve topped up and I still have money left.” ForHousing, which owns the block of flats, says regular checks of the electricity meters are carried out.

Martyn Hague director of neighbourhoods at ForHousing, which owns the block of flats, said: “During a routine appointment at the New Street block one of our contractors discovered that work had been carried out to Ms Prince’s electricity meter and that it has been connected to the meter for the communal block. We raised this issue with Ms Prince immediately. “This work was not carried out by ForHousing or one of our contractors.

Keepers at the zoo in El Paso, Texas say the woman endangered both herself and the primates. Bizarre footage posted on Instagram shows the woman sitting under a waterfall and feeding the animals, named Libby and Sunday. She then wades through water in the enclosure and is helped out by a passer-by. It emerged on Monday that the woman, an employee at a law firm, has lost her job as a result of her actions. Joe Montisano, the zooaposs director, is said to have branded her as stupid and lucky after the incident came to light. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror. And keeper Mason Kleist told local TV station ABC : These are primates weaposre talking about, they could do some substantial damage to you. They may be small monkeyaposs but they can take you to the groundthey wanted to. The keeper added that the monkeys have a specialised diet so her feeding them could cause stomach problems and bowel disruptions. And he claimed that the woman put the monkeys at risk of catching Covid-. Mr Kleist said: Anything that we have they could get as well so Covid is no dferent.

We took the necessary steps to prevent them from getting that, so for someone to just go in there and give them food from their hands could just ruin that. Reports suggested that the zoo had been considering pressing charges against the woman. And it has not emerged that she has lost her job at Lovett Law Firm, who posted about the incident on Facebook. A statement said: We learned this morning that the inidual who was filmed trespassing in the spider monkey enclosure of the El Paso Zoo was an employee of Lovett Law Firm. She has been terminated. The firm has always been a strong supporter of animals and animal advocacy. We absolutely do not condone this irresponsible and reckless behavior. We support the El Paso Zoo and our thoughts go out to the spider monkeys, Libby and Sunday, and hope that they will recover from this very traumatic experience. Social media posts suggested the woman, who has not been identied, fed the monkeys Hot Cheetos, but the zoo has not confirmed this.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnZoos"},{"url":null,"title":"mans brutal assessment rank home","story":"NewsMans brutal assessment of rank home makeover labelled best reaction everJohn Geoghegans no-nonsense reaction to seeing his newly decorated bedroom on BBC Ones Your Home In Their Hands has gone viral as he warns the decorator not to touch the other roomsmirrorShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsSenior Audience Writer:,  AUG Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror tv video husband-gives-incredible-reaction-tv-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:EUWxVJ,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

John Geogheganaposs face says it all when he opens his eyes to see his bedroom now decorated with yellow floral wallpaper and a blue wardrobe, as his we Rachel tries very, very hard to find the positives. The car-crash clip from BBC Oneaposs Your Home In Their Hands from  saw four decorators compete to create the best design - and itaposs fair to sayJohn had anything to do with it, the interior designer responsible for his bedroom would be looking for a new job. After Rachel says she likes the wardrobe, John says: Nah, itaposs too much. For me itaposs too busy. I wouldnapost have done anything like it and I donapost like it. Youaposre supposed to be able to go to sleep in a bedroom and itaposs like a kidsapos play area. I think it looks horrendous, it doesnapost look anything like a bedroom. So sorry, but itaposs a big thumbs down from me. Itaposs hideous. I think itaposs even too much for Rachelshe was to tell the truth.  As presenter Celia Sawyer awkwardly tries to get his we on side, John quickly adds: Itaposs rank. I donapost like it at all. Definitely not. Askingthey will keep the room with the new design, John states not for long and says his message for the designer would simply be: Donapost touch the other room.The moment of TV gold has been viewed almost one million times after being shared on Twitter with the caption: Still the best reaction to a house makeover ever. And to be fair to John, pretty much everyone  was in agreement. One said: If you use that wallpaper, the rest of the room should be as plain as possible. It just looks like the designer vomited up every idea they had. A second wrote: Poor woman clearly hated the room  was fighting back tears yet the presenter was badgering her to speak positively about having a bedroom where the fabric fairy had been sick. It looks like other episodes went in a fairly similar direction with a viewer saying: I’m beginning to think it’s a prank show after watching another. It’s called Your Home in Their Hands.

Originally, the couple was meant to be having a small wedding in Italy surrounded by  of their closest friends and family as well as a party when they ed, but because of the coronavirus pandemic, their plans were put back. I didnapost want a big wedding so this was my idea of perfection and I thought my fiancés too, he brought up eloping way before I said anything, she explained. But when her mother-in-law moved down the road, things went south.Over a year that version of the wedding was cancelled a nd time, [mother-in-law] moved down the road and I got pregnant. Since MIL moved she’s been hell. I had the baby prematurely in December. She is fine but while still in hospital MIL told me all the things Iaposd done ‘wrong’ during the pregnancy that caused the premature birth. She visits all the time unannounced, I have begged her to at least call ahead and does things with the baby I ask her not to but she knows best. Whataposs more, she also told the couple she was glad their wedding had been called as they were making a big mistake and that they were really going to regret itthey didn’t have a ‘proper’ wedding.She has completely hijacked planning our September wedding, the woman continued.Itaposs now a lot more your traditional over the top big white wedding. It probably would be the perfect wedding for someone  but it really isn’t what I wanted. The one thing I was adamant on was that I was making my dress and baby’s dress, she said, as she revealed she used to be a bespoke wedding dress designer. Whilst sheaposd already made her own dress, she was waiting to make her babyaposs closer to the big day so that that the size is right.So when her mother-in-law turned up one day gushing about the dress she bought for the baby to wear for the wedding, she was livid. I said take it back, Iaposm making the dress, the woman recalled. She said I should be grateful she’d been proactive when I hadnapost, that baby would probably have nothing to wear on the dayit was left to me. She said it cost her a lot of money and [she] won’t be able toit. I left and fiancé told me she broke down crying and was ‘inconsolable’. After, he shouted at me for treating his mum like that and told me how I was turning into a bridezilla. Despite begging him to support her on this as sheaposd given up control on the rest of the wedding plans, he said that I haven’t even made the dress so what does it mattershe wears something . I asked him to tell me the truth onhe even wanted this wedding as it was a hell of a lot of money to just throw at a party we were both going to hate, but he couldnapost give her a straight answer, so she asked Reddit users for their opinion on the situation.The majority of people criticised her husband-to-be, with many urging her to reconsider her decision to tie the knot with him. One person said: Think about whether you really want to marry a man that is already married to his mother  Seriously though, this is a little sneak peek into your future. You still have time. Whilst another added: If your fiance canapost stand up for you now, he certainly wonapost after the wedding. If your opinion doesnapost matter one bit to him when it comes to YOUR wedding and YOUR child, youaposre in for a very dficult marriage. A third agreed: Reconsider marrying this guy before itaposs too late. He and his mom deserve each other, you deserve better.

In the video Belarusian blogger Roman Protasevich claims he is in good health and acknowledges having played a role in organising mass protests in Minsk last year. Appearing on several channels of the Telegram messaging app the opposition activist, wearing a dark sweatshirt and with his hands tightly clasped in front of him, says he is in a pre-trial detention facility in Minsk and denies having heart problems reported by some social media. He says that he has been treated correctly and lawfully and that he will continue to cooperate with the criminal investigation into his activities. Protasevich then says he will confess to organising mass riots, according to translations of his message. It has been claimed that the -year-old journalist was forced to make the statement under duress.Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who ran in the  elections as the main opposition candidate which she claims were rigged by PresidentAlexander Lukashenko, tweeted: The regimeaposs propaganda channels posted a video of arrested Roman Protasevich, saying that he is treated lawfully in the Minsk Detention Center No.This is how Raman looks under physical and moral pressure. I demand the immediate release of Raman and all political prisoners. Others have suggested that apparent marks on Protasevichaposs forehead indicate that he was beaten. It is unclear when the video was taken, but it was published following reports that he was critically ill with a heart condition. Pawel Jablonski, Polandaposs deputy foreign minister, told private broadcaster TVN that Protasevichaposs mother had been in contact with his government. We have received a signal from the mother of Roman Protasevich that his health situation is very serious, he said. That is as much as I can say on that subject.  The journalist was detained in Minsk after Ryanair flight FR from Greece to Lithuania changed course last night with a Belarusian MIG fighter having been scrambled to a supposed bomb scare.Michael OaposLeary, CEO of the Dublin-based airline, claimed the forced landing was a state-sponsored hijackingand that KGB agents were on the plane.More than  passengers were forced to land in Belarus against their will - and the action led to the arrest of journalist Roman Protasevich, on what Mr Raab called spurious charges by the regime led by Alexander Lukashenko.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Belarus had made a calculated and cynical ploy using a hoax bomb alert - and did not rule out further action to tackle its actions through the Nord Stream pipeline.Belarusapos Ambassador to the UK was today summoned for Britain to convey its condemnation of the incident. Vowing action, Mr Raab told Parliament: The scenario as reported is a shocking assault on civil aviation and an assault on international law. It represents a danger to civilian flights everywhere and it is an egregious and extraordinary departure from the international law and international practice that guides international civil aviation under the Chicago convention.  Mr Raab said the bomb threat appeared to have been non-existent. He told Parliament: “The Belarusian authorities claimed this was in relation to an alleged bomb threat. We’ve seen no evidence to support that claim. What we have seen is that Belarus scrambled a MIG fighter, forced the plane to ert to Minsk, then used this emergency landing as an opportunity to arrest a prominent journalist.” Mr Lukashenko, , has faced the biggest challenge of his nearly -year-old rule from protesters who took to the streets after he was declared the winner of an election last year they said was rigged. About , people have been detained since the start of regular demonstrations in August . Lukashenko denies electoral fraud and has accused the West of sponsoring the protests.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnRyanairAleksandr LukashenkoAppsPolitics"},{"url":null,"title":"journalist taken hijacked ryanair flight","story":"NewsJournalist taken from hijacked Ryanair flight forced to admit and had nose brokenThe Lithuania-based blogger and his female companion, Sofia Sapega, were both taken into custody after Belarus scrambled a warplane to intercept a Ryanair aircraftmirrorShareByAndrius SytasWilliam WalkerNews Reporter:,  MAY NewsRoman Protasevich was seen in a new video released by Belarusian authorities\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Lithuania-based blogger and his female companion, Sofia Sapega, were both taken into custody after Belarus scrambled a warplane to intercept a Ryanair aircraft flying from Athens to Vilnius. It was erted to Minsk on Sunday in an action condemned by the European Union and the US. Appearing on several channels of the Telegram messaging app on Monday, Mr Protasevich, , acknowledged playing a role in organising mass disturbances in Minsk last year.  To his dad, Dzmitry Protasevich, the video appeared to be a result of coercion. Itaposs likely his nose is broken, because the shape of it has changed and thereaposs a lot of powder on it. All of the left side of his face has powder, he told Reuters in an interview in Russian on Monday from Wroclaw, Poland, where he and his we live. Itaposs not his words, itaposs not his intonation of speech. He is acting very reserved and you can see he is nervous. And itaposs not his pack of cigarettes on the table - he doesnapost smoke these. So I think he was forced. He added: My son cannot admit to creating the mass disorders, because he just didnapost do any such thing. Belarusapos Interior Ministry said Mr Protasevich was being held in jail and had not complained of ill health. The  leaders of the European Union on Monday demanded his immediate release as well as an investigation by the International Civil Aviation Organization into the incident.  They also agreed to impose more sanctions on Belarus, called on their airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace and authorised work to ban Belarusian airlines from European skies and airports, a spokesman said. The EU, along with the United States, UK and Canada had already imposed asset freezes and travel bans on almost  Belarusian officials, including President Alexander Lukashenko. That followed an August election that opponents and the West say was a sham. The president has denied electoral fraud. Since the disputed vote, authorities have rounded up thousands of his opponents, with all major opposition figures now in jail or exile.  We are surprised that the destiny of one person means a lot, that it is seen as valuable to the European Union, Dzmitry Protasevich said. This is something that is lost in Belarus. I think what happened was an act of revenge, to enlighten others: Look what we can do, he said. This is total insanity, what is going on. His social media feed from exile has been one of the last remaining independent outlets for news about the country since a mass crackdown on dissent last year.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorMore OnRyanair"},{"url":null,"title":"truth behind belaruss ryanair hijack","story":"NewsTruth behind Belaruss Ryanair hijack - an unprecedented act of state aggressionBEHIND THE NEWS: What kind of state hijacks a Ryanair flight  Well Belarus is no ordinary state, it is a rogue ­dictatorship closely linked with Vladimir Putin’s Russia and one which today showed again its contempt for the international community and its citizensmirrorShareCommentsByMatt RoperFeatures writer:,  MAY NewsRoman Protasevich, founder of the NEXTA Belorussian opposition media channel, was detained in Belarus \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The more you hear about what happened in the skies above Belarus on Sunday, the more reckless it appears. An EU-owned, EU-registered plane full of EU citizens travelling between two EU capitals was hijacked in order to seize an EU-recognised political refugee who now faces the death penalty. This extraordinary act of aggression has no precedent in history. Ryanair flight , flying between Greece and Lithuania, was convinced to redirect to Belarus’s capital Minsk. Air traffic controllers lied to the crew, telling them there was a bomb on board, all the while shadowed by a MiG- fighter jet. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  However, Belarus is not an ­ordinary state, it is a rogue ­dictatorship closely linked with Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Last summer crowds of up to , gathered in Minsk for days, protesting over President Alexander Lukashenko’s handling of Covid and a rigged election. Sanctions were enforced and yet nine months on Lukashenko has been emboldened to commit this act of state terrorism. There are reports Belarusian KGB secret service agents were on board and started a fight with Ryanair crew, before the aircraft – and its terried  passengers – had its unexpected landing.Like news  Get the best of the dayaposs updates by signing up the Mirroraposs email newsletter In Minsk, dissident journalist and blogger Roman Protasevich, the founder of online news channel Nexta, was arrested, before the rest of the passengers were sent on their way. Passenger Marius Rutkauskas, who spoke after the plane arrived in Vilnius hours later, said Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, , who was also detained, were sitting behind him. He said: “He freaked out when the pilot said the plane is erted to Minsk. He said there’s a death penalty awaiting him there. “We sat for an hour after the landing. Then they started releasing passengers and took those two. We did not see them again.”  Belarus state media said the decision to intervene had been ordered personally by President Lukashenko after the Nexta channel was used to organise those protests against his regime and -year-old Protasevich was charged with inciting riots. In repsonse there has been a global chorus of condemnation. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that “the outrageous and illegal behaviour of the regime in Belarus will have consequences. Those responsible for the Ryanair hijacking must be sanctioned. Journalist Roman Protasevich must be released immediately,”British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that “this outlandish action by Lukashenko will have serious implications”. US diplomats also weighed in, with US Ambassador to Belarus Julie Fisher described the actions as “abhorrent” tweeting: “Lukashenka and his regime today showed again its contempt for the international community and its citizens.” Kanstantsin Dzehtsiarou, a Belarusian professor of human rights at Liverpool University, said Lukashenko wouldn’t have surprised citizens used to his flouting of the law. “If I didn’t know it was true I would think it was a joke., says Kanstantsin. It follows the same pattern of contempt of international, and domestic, law, showing that the government thinks it can get away with anything..” Kanstantsin says Lukashenko has become increasingly audacious after his brutal suppression of an uprising last year was met with few reprisals by the international community. More than , protesters were arrested and hundreds jailed. While Europe’s modest sanctions included a travel ban and freezing bank accounts of  iniduals, perhaps the most damaging consequence was Belarus being banned from this year’s Eurovision song contest after repeatedly submitting songs calling for “no dissent”. Kanstantsin says: “First, there were the forceful dissolution of peace protests. Next, the torture of activists who participated, which is prohibited under all sorts of international conventions and a clear violation of human rights. “Then the human rights defenders were persecuted and imprisoned, which was absolutely arbitrary and clearly prohibited by international law. We saw journalists arrested who have spent month in prison, and last month some people accused of plotting against the president were taken from Russia and placed in Belarusian prisons. “Yet the reaction of the global community has been extremely slow. For instance, the UN human rights council has only just established a  to start looking at torture allegations.  “That creates the feeling of immunity, that Lukashenko is actually invincible. It’s also the feeling that dominates in Belarus among ordinary people, people think that he can do whatever he wants and nobody can do anything to stop him.” But he says erting a commercial airline is a signicant escalation. “Collaboration is crucial in civil aviation, the day-to-day interaction between countries would not be possible without it and now Belarus has been found to have lied to an air crew and that interferences with the key fabric of international relations. It shows that Lukashenko is not just a threat to his people, he’s a threat to the whole of Europe.”  It’s not the first time Lukashenko, who has ruled the country for the last  years and who George W Bush famously referred to as the “last dictator of Europe”, has been accused of going to extreme s to hunt down his political enemies. Earlier this year, a secretly-recorded audio emerged from  believed to have captured Belarusian KGB chairman Vadim Zaitsev plotting the assassination of three of the president’s critics who had fled to Germany and lived in exile. In the recording, in which he said over £million had been put in a dedicated account to finance the killings, he said: “We’ll plant [a bomb] and so on and this f***ing rat will be taken down in f***ing pieces - legs in one direction, arms in the other direction. “If everything [looks like] natural causes, it won’t get into people’s minds the same way.”  Lukashenko’s track record is one of the reasons Kanstantsin is concerned for the well-being of Raman Pratasevich, co-founder of the opposition Nexta channel on Telegram, which was used for mobilising street protests. The journalist faces extremism charges in Belarus, including organising mass riots and inciting social hatred, and could face  years in jailconvicted of several charges. But Kanstantsin believes he could face more serious charges. He says: “Since August people are being beaten up for less that what he is accused of, so my main concern is that he can easily be ill-treated. At the moment he is accused of inciting riots which can face up to eight years in prison, but they might easily change their indictment to something more serious like terrorism, for which he could face the death penalty.”  He says that this time Europe and the US need to be swt and tough in showing Lukashenko he can’t get away with flouting international law. Lithuania was the first to announce sanctions, announcing that all flights to and from Lithuanian airports must from midnight avoid Belarusian air space. Other airlines have announced they would also not be using Belarusian airspace. And the French presidency said a request had been sent to the International Civil Aviation Organizationto suspend international flights over Belarusian air space.  Banning the Belarusian state carrier Belavia from European airports would also be discussed, as well as unspecied measures regarding ground transport links. It has also been suggested that sanctions are placed on Belarus – or that institutions such as the European Investment Bank should not participate in projects that finance Minsk. Other leaders, who believe that Lukashenko’s actions would have been endorsed by Russia, said Putin must also be punished for the hijacking. Radoslaw Sikorski, a former Polish foreign minister and now member of the European parliament, proposed halting Russia’s huge Nord Stream  gas pipeline to Germany. Kanstantsin agrees. “Both he and Putin needs to be held accountable, it can’t just be swept under the rug. “If the West acts, it will send a very clear message to both Lukashenko and Putin that they can’t get away with anything. If we don’t, the next time it might not be an plane that is forcibly landed, but one that is shot down.

lead after a fine first leg performance.Now they are looking for one last big push at Rugby Park to earn a place back in the top flight.“It is a massive game for the club and as players, we want to play in the Premiership,” said McGhee.“We feel the club belongs there and we are determined to get over the line now. | SPFL\" width\"\" \"\" src\"https:www.youtube embed pgSI-zOzg featureoembed\" frameborder\"\" allow\"accelerometer autoplay clipboard-write encrypted-media gyroscope picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen“It is a tough game, Killie are a good side at home but you saw the other night we put in a good performance and matched them.“We will look to do the same again # all we can do is concentrate on ourselves and give maximum effort.”McGhee played  times in the top flight after coming through the youth system at Hearts.However, he left Tynecastle in  for Championship Falkirk before signing at Dens Park two years ago.And he says ato the Premiership was always a target.“Yes, definitely. Obviously I spoke to the manager about his plans for myself and the club,” he added.“It was a no-brainer as I wanted to be part of something and Dundee has the foundations # the fans, the backing, everything about it is a Premiership side.“So I thought it would be great to be part of that, to get the club back to where it belongs.“I jumped at the chance, I have never looked back and the club have been great with me.”McGhee has proved a key player since ing to James McPake’s side in December.A goal at Inverness as a box-to-box midfielder sparked an impressive season where, despite a three-month injury, McGhee has notched another four goals since.Three of those have come in the last three games, proving critical in the positive position the Dark Blues find themselves in ahead of their play-off final second leg.That included the opening goal against Killie on Thursday night.And McGhee, an attacking midfielder in his youth, is delighted to have been given a new lease of le in the middle of the park.He said: “I love it. I have always thought I should have played there.“Obviously the gaffer has spoken about it and tried me there.“It is paying off and going forward that’s where I see my career panning out.“BeforeI had said to managers I would like to play in midfield I might have got a chance but I was playing every week in defence and I was doing reasonably well there so I didn#t want to change anything.“But this season was the perfect opportunity for me to do that and so far it has paid off.“I had played a few games for Dundee in the holding role which is dferent from what I am doing now.“Now it is all about getting up and supporting play between the midfield and strikers.“I always got goals when I was younger but then I was moved to the back as I was a bit taller.“But I have always had the knack of finding wee areas in the box to get half chances and luckily it is happening at the right time of the season.”Dundee analysis: Energised Dark Blues on the verge of promotion after dominant first leg\" title\"#Dundee analysis: Energised Dark Blues on the verge of promotion after dominant first leg# #

He won a trophy for them and finished third in the Premier League.”McCall, meanwhile, is adamant the United job remains an inviting one — evenhe always felt it was one of the two most challenging posts in Scottish management.He added: “When I was up there, I always thought that Dundee United and Aberdeen were the toughest jobs in Scottish football because you were within one generation of Wee Jim [McLean] and Sir Alex Ferguson.“They were better than Rangers and Celtic the vast majority of the time and you had fans in the stadium who were aware of that, and that’s how you were judged.#And at Tannadice there are pictures of Wee Jim everywhere! It’s a tough gig — but a great gig for someone. There’s no doubt about that.”Micky Mellon set to leave Dundee United\" title\"#Micky Mellon set to leave Dundee United# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football dundee-united

reopen its doors this week and we#ve had a sneak peek at the new owners# plans.The Cupar park has been closed for  months and its future looked uncertain after it plunged into administration last year.However, it was saved in a buy-out by multi-millionaire gaming boss David Hamilton from Fe, and Dundee businessman Gavin Findlay.And the pair say that while their families initially thought they#d lost their minds, they have huge ambitions for the popular centre.New animals, a breeding programme, another eating place and even a children#s nursery are just some of the ideas they have lined up.David, , said reading about the Scottish Deer Centre#s possible closure in The Courier last summer almost broke his heart.#I immediately WhatsApped Gav and said, do you fancy buying a zoo #Gavin added: #And instantly, without a second thought, I said yes, why not buy a zoo #The business partners will keep the animals already popular with families but intend to add more species.They have already introduced Highland cows, two of which have just had calves.Red pandas and Arctic foxes are among the other attractions they#ll bring, joining the deer, otters, European brown bears, lynx and wildcats which have been in place for years.David and Gavin, , are enormously enthusiastic about the Scottish Deer Centre#s potential.They are both dads and want to make the -acre park even more family-friendly.David, who recently sold his Dundee games studio Ninja Kiwi in an estimated £ million deal, said: #We definitely want to have a lot more for kids to do.#I#ve brought my six-year-old here and while it#s great for her to see the animals, she constantly wants to go to the adventure playground.#We#re already talking about bringing in a giant inflatable pillow and we recently bought a fire engine and an old tractor to play on.#Gavin says the park will eventually be more interactive.#Before, you could walk around and see things but moving forward we really want people to get more involved in the park.#A pre-school nursery and a smoke house restaurant are two of the other things on the businessmen#s agenda.#We#re going to remove the cafe and turn it into Little Doe Day Care,# David said.#My brother and sister-in-law both work for the NHS and struggled to get their daughter into nursery when everything shut down.#It#ll be good for the park and good from an educational point of view.#Gavin, who is director of G Scaffolding, said the idea is to future-proof the park.#We#ll be able to improve the park with the income from the nursery,# he said.#Often in nursery they#ll have  kids in high-vis walking around the street.#We#ll have them walking around in a safe area in the park while being educated.#The Scottish Deer Centre was previously owned by The Edinburgh Woollen Mill, which collapsed in November putting around , jobs at risk.Woollen Mill boss Sir Philip Day also owned Peacocks, Jaeger and other high street chains.David said Sir Philip had wanted to invest more in the Cupar park but was unable to do so.#He said he was disappointed he didn#t have time to do it because he had  retail units,# he said.#There were other interested buyers but he chose us because we#re out-the-box thinkers.#Among David and Gavin#s #out-the-box# thoughts is to enlist Dundee graffiti artist Adam Milroy to do some artwork in the park.Adam recently completed an impressive -feet mural paying homage to Dundee#s famous Tay Whale and they hope he can replicate his success on their barns.#Gav loves the outdoors and it#s close to me in Wormit,# said David.#We came here every year to Santa#s grotto and it would have been heart-breaking for usthe centre closed.#He added: #It#s exciting, really exciting, for us and our families and everyone we know.#Opportunities like this don#t come very often.#David#s dad grew up in Cupar and David said: #He#s super proud we#ve actually got the deer centre because it#s been a huge part of his family all his letime.#Gavin said he loved the idea the second he heard it but the fact he is a new dad sealed the deal.#I just couldn#t think of anything better than watching my wee boy growing up around a zoo and around the animals,# he said.Selling the idea to his family also proved interesting.#I don#t think my partner believed me when I first said,# said Gavin.#I think she just thought it was one of my moments I was having.#But despite all the grand plans, David and Gavin#s first priority is the animals.Gavin said: #One thing we said right from the start is we would rather leave a legacy as people who invested in the future of the animals than just two guys who bought a zoo.#The Scottish Deer Centre opens on May  at am.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE

The unreliability and unavailability of ferry services is having serious effects on the islands’ economy, construction projects, healthcare provision and food delivery.#I will be raising these issues as a matter of urgency to the new minister for transport.”Caledonian MacBrayne ferries have stopped taking bookings until June , and the loss of the fleet#s main vessel means that both tourists and islanders are having to take alternate ferries.The expected increase in the number of tourists flocking to the islands through the summer season is expected to pose further problems.With capacity on the ferries filling up, or already unavailable, the issue has started to impact flights too. Both essential and non-essential travel is becoming increasingly dficult as a result.mdash CalMac FerriesMay , Those trying to book transport have often been left in the dark. Mr Allan said: “What started over a month and a half ago with the loss of the fleet’s main vessel has spilled over onto nearly every other route, signicantly reducing capacity across the region, not least in South Uist and Barra.#Transport Scotland is considering what it should do next to address the problems.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/05/vaccine-rollout-140521-e1621007541735-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland track the spread in these charts and maps2001","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWe#ve put together a collection of daily updated charts and maps to track the coronavirus crisis in Scotland.The table below shows an at-a-glance view of the situation in each local authority.

This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus.The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

defeat at Dundee United on March , the first match since the exit of former manager Derek McInnes after nearly eight years at the helm.The full-back was cup-tied for the Scottish Cup games against Dundee United, Livingston and Dumbarton, having played in the tournament earlier in the season during a loan spell with League One Forfar Athletic.However, MacKenzie has started three of the four Premiership games since manager Glass# arrival at the club in early April.Throughout those matches, Considine has played in the left-sided centre-back role alongside left-back MacKenzie in a defensive back four under the new gaffer.The Scotland cap, who missed out on selection to Steve Clarke#s -man Euro  squad, has also given valuable advice to MacKenzie during games.The latter said: #It’s a dream to play alongside Andy, especially in those first few games, because he’s been there and done it.“He’s very experienced so he was able to give me good pointers.#Andy has helped me a lot since I came in full-time.#Manager Glass praised MacKenzie for his performance in restricting the influence of Australian international winger Martin Boyle in the recent - loss to Hibs at Pittodrie.The defender also started the - loss to Premiership champions Rangers at Ibrox on the final day of the season.In the build up to Rangers# first two goals, the ball deflected off MacKenzie, but the left-back was not culpable for those goals.Having built starting momentum within Glass# starting XI, MacKenzie admits the campaign ended at the wrong time for him personally.He wanted more first team action.Now he is determined tofor pre-season training in the third week of June fired up and ready for a fight to retain his starting spot ahead of the season opener in the Uefa Conference League second qualying round on Thursday July .He said: #I had to wait my time as I am  now.#I was just delighted to get the opportunity given to me by Paul and Barry #I have loved every minute of it and just want more.#The season probably ended at the wrong time for me.#The manager has given me the opportunity and now it is up to me to make sure I perform and stay in the team.#I want to be playing against the best players in the country.#Mackenzie spent the first half of the season on loan at League One Forfar, starting  games, including a - League Cup loss to Hibs.He was initially scheduled to go on loan to Atlanta United ,  the B team of the MLS side, last March.However, the loan to Aberdeen#s strategic partner club fell through due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.When football finally ed, MacKenzie dropped into the third tier of Scottish football with Forfar, for six months that were valuable to his development.He said: #Obviously the quality and the tempo are higher in the Premiership.#However, I was impressed with the standard of League One and all the teams.#Going there stood me in good stead for playing for Aberdeen.#MacKenzie#s first team breakthrough was quickly followed by a two-year contract extension which he penned in late March, tying him to the club until summer .Another rising full-back Calvin Ramsay, , also made his debut first team start this year when playing, and impressing, in the - Scottish Cup defeat of Dumbarton.Ramsay was also secured on a long-term contract extension in January until summer .MacKenzie: #There are a lot of great young players at the club and the ones who have come into the first team have done well.“Calvin has come in and did well, while Dean Campbell has played a lot of games.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside kids vote for nature","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Ignore a small path to your right and continue to a T-junction.Turn rightpast the village playing fields, with woods to your left. After m, turn left at a fork in the track into the woodland .The track meets the other route just ahead. Veering left your path climbs noticeably over the next .km, through plantations, past the reservoir off to the right # worth a small detour # until arriving at a junction.The Kintyre Way continues north whereas your path heads sharply left to continue up the hill.The next section opens out and is a lovely part of the walk, with excellent views back to Arran.After a few minutes, and as the path heads south on the higher section, look for the path to the summit on your right.It is now a very short hop to the summit Trig pointfor some lovely views right down Kintyre and towards Ailsa Craig.Although known as Deer Hill, Cnoc an Ghabar translates as Goat Hill I suspect there will be an explanation!Return to the path, meandering southwards for .km, with the odd little up and plenty of steep downs, passing back into the woodland where it meets another track.Turn left and look out for the path right just over m ahead. Follow this down through the dark woods.After m look for the path and steps heading right.

You can now enjoy the vast open expanse of sand as you head eastwards across the lovely Carradale Bay.When you reach the far end of the bay, over km away, veer right to a gate by a ruin.Passing through the gate a small path now meanders up through gorse and bracken heading south towards Carradale Point.It is worth keeping to the higher ground on the way out as the path drops down through interesting rocks near its end with some grand views.This is also a great vantage point from which to see the area’s feral goats,about.At the end you can cross to the vitried fort on the islet unless there are very high spring tides.To , take the lower path* up the western side just above the shoreline # a mass of wildflowers in early summer. This also allows closer inspection of the amazing folded Dalradian rocks.Once back at the bay # where you may decide a swim is in order # head right up the track from the carpark at its eastern end.After a gate you will be in fields which may have livestock. Veer sharp left at the other side of the first field and follow the track to another gate out on to a lane.Head straight ahead toto Carradale village and the main road. Right will take you back down to the harbour and past potential refreshments.*You can also follow part of the coast or go over the top to Port Righand along the edge of the golf course via Airds Castle ruins before dropping back down to Carradale harbour.

With their strong Gaelic and Norse heritage they defied the will of kings, and their political influence was undeniable.This independence of spirit might account, in part at least, for a modern-day habit of Islay folk # to enter the world of politics.With the election earlier this month of Jenni Minto as constituency MSP, the island now has three serving Argyll and Bute politicians, with council leader Councillor Robin Currie and Councillor Alastair Redman.Orkney and Shetland LibDem MP Alistair Carmichael, another Ileach, can be added to the list # and there may be more out there.Then there is George Robertson # now Lord Robertson of Port Ellen # former Labour politician and Secretary General of NATO, and the much-respected late Labour leader John Smith, both of whom have Islay connections.All of the above from an island of little more than , people.The Argyllshire Advertiser decided to ask the politicians themselves for their theories about why Islay has the habit of producing a preponderance of politicians.Leader of Argyll and Bute Council Robin Currie explained: #Ileachs are known for their sense of community, their enthusiasm for their island and their culture, and their erse mix of skills and resilience # so it#s no surprise that so many of us want to take that a stage further by representing not only our own island but the whole of Argyll and Bute, or indeed the country itself, as is the case with George Robertson and the late John Smith.#All of these characteristics will stand anyone in good stead when it comes to le as an elected representative, whether that’s at local or national government level.#It#s great that [in Argyll and Bute] we have a good balance of elected representatives of all political flavours, who understand the needs and characteristics of that mix of communities, and who can bring that knowledge together to work on issues of strategic as well as local importance.#Councillor Currie added: #It goes without saying that I wish my fellow Ileach, Jenni Minto, every success in her new role and I look forward to working with her.#Conservative Alastair Redman # one of three councillors serving Kintyre and the Isles alongside Councillor Currieand Tarbert#s Anne Horn# pointed to Islay#s #unique economy and location# as part of the reason for its political prominence.#Islay is both rural and at the same time heavily industrialised with our large number of distilleries,# he said.#It might be considered isolated yet is a global trading powerhouse. We on Islay have a population of just a few thousand yet our name is world famous.#There is also our history which to a degree separates us from mainland Scotland. Finlaggan was the seat of the Lords of the Isles under Clan Donald with roots that go back beyond the Kingdom of Scotland, beginning with Somerled in the th century.#I feel that this has led to Ileachs being more independent and perhaps at times more forthright than others.#I hope that many more councillors, MSPs, MPs, cabinet ministers, lords and even prime ministers will come from my home island which, though small, has made a huge mark on this world.#The last word goes to the newest member of Islay#s political gang, Jenni Minto MSP.The SNP member also cited the island#s past influence on Scottish politics through Finlaggan and the Lordship of the Isles.And she highlighted more examples of single-minded Ileachs making their mark on the world.#In - three ships with Islay people on board sailed for the New York colony,# said Ms Minto.#On one of these was five-year-old Alexander McDougall, who became a key figure in America’s war for independence. He had a very successful le, rising to the rank of Major General in the continental army. He then entered public service and was elected to the New York state senate. On his death he was described by George Washington as one of the five pillars of the American revolution.##I am not Islay-born,# she continued, #but feel very lucky to live on such a wonderful island. I often describe it as the centre of the universe, and there are very few places you can visit without meeting someone from Islay or someone who has a connection with the island.#I think that coming from, or living on, an island you need a level of resilience and creativity but you also have a true sense of community and working together.#Islay is also known to be a friendly place, where everyone has time to chat and listen to other people’s thoughts and views.#I think all of these traits are needed in politics and so perhaps it is not a surprise that Islay people have entered public service.#PICS:Jenni Minto MSP. no_aScotElection_McglynnArgyll and Bute Council leader, Robin Currie. aelectionCurrienoCouncillor Alastair Redman.

However, there now seems to be an acceptance in Transport Scotland that a new solution has to be found.In a letter to the press, George Allan points out that the -mile route from Strathlachlan to Colintraive and the eight miles between Ormidale and Tighnabruaich were designed and constructed in  or  years.I was a member of the survey and design team on these routes. I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.Philip Shimmin, Inverness.Sir,I would like to say thank you to all the lads who have been working at the Crinan Canal # often when the north winds were blowing and water was pouring down from the hills into the empty canal more quickly than the pumps were able to remove it.The men greeted me each morning as I walked past to go over the temporary bridge. They were trying to renew the basement concrete which supports the new bridges in spite of the wet, cold weather.Fortunately, April was drier and they managed to fit the new gates thanks to the massive cranes and the skill of the lorry drivers carrying these heavy loads to and from the canal.Others have cleared the rubbish, including lots of old car tyres, which had been dumped.It is good to see the canal filled and in working order again.J Thorgrimsson, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"reduce farm costs save time and make life easier","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

With the evenings getting longer and brighter you can use your garden or patio as a great extension to your home and just sit back and relax.It’s at this time of year that lawns need to be mowed more frequently, so here are some key pointers on getting that perfect cared-for look.Mow at least once a week and raise the mower blades when it’s very hot weather. Don’t mow when grass is wet or during a drought and don’t collect your clippings during dry spells as this helps conserve moisture.Keep watering throughout the summer unless there is a water shortage and repair bare patches with turf or re-seeding.This is also the month to ensure that all your plants are adequately fed, particularly those in baskets and tubs.Plants benefit from a regular feeding programme as they are growing vigorously and need their nutrition levels to be kept up. Slow-release granules are a good idea for pots and baskets because they last for about six months and release food as it is required into the compost.Not often thought of as a container plant, but an excellent option for small gardens, is a rose.A simple solution for June is to create an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.Just buy a selection of dferent sized pots, plant them with a ieties of roses and then place them together in a group.There is a rose for every garden situation. From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew. Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and midsummer day arrives, here are few ‘must do’ jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters a unique holiday destination","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But never mind, Chinese astronauts, who regard a moon base as essential for probing outer space, have just about solved these problems with a bioregenerative le support system called Yuegong-, or Lunar Palace  . LP is a temperature and humidity-controlled, sealed, articial human-animal-plant-microorganism ecosystem in which oxygen, water and food sources are recycled to create an Earth-like environment. The latest experiment had LP in use continuously for a whole year, with two crews of four each having two periods of occupation and the maximum stay being  days. All emerged fit and healthy.LP comprises a living area, two cabins for growing plants , an animal-raising room housing yellow mealworms and waste treatment and storage rooms.Crew requirements # food, water, oxygen and waste disposal # are accommodated as follows: plants and mealworms provide food, the latter being processed into ‘flour’ for bread.Plant photosynthesis provides oxygen and consumes CO, while puried water from plant transpiration and condensation provides drinking and washing water.Nitrogen puried from crew urine generates plant fertiliser, while the remaining urine is puried along with waste water for plant irrigation.Crew faeces mixed with straw are fermented by bacteria to produce CO for plant photosynthesis, while fermented vegetable waste is fed to the mealworms. The whole system achieved  per cent recycling, the only non-recyclable product requiring storage being solid waste from fermented faeces.All this represents huge progress, but we are not there yet. Running LP requires massive energy input, particularly since lunar days and nights each last an Earth month, and the nights are freezing.But still, I have read of plans to build kilometre-high lunar towers bearing solar  , possible because of the moon’s zero gravity, but don’t hold your breath!* https:doi.org . ...# arxiv.org abs ."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 21 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Do not touch the fabric tipof the swab.Open your mouth wide and rub the fabric tip over both tonsils . Do this  times on each side. Itrsquos normal to find this a bit uncomfortable.Using the same swab, insert it up your nostril until you feel resistance.Rotate the swab in your nostril  times.Pick up the extraction tube, open the lid and place the fabric tip of the swab in the fluid in the tube.Firmly press the swab against the bottom-inside of the tube and rotate it around for  seconds. Itrsquos important to mix thoroughly.Pinch the tube as you remove the swab and put the nozzle cap on.Squeeze the extraction tube to place two drops of fluid on the test strip. Watch out for any air bubbles.Set a timer for  minutes and leave the test strip on a clean, flat surface.Once your test is complete, place all used test kit contents in the waste bag provided and put this in your bin.Where testing takes place -

Eight designs will be chosen to become stamps which will be on sale across the UK.Children may choose to illustrate frontline workers in health or social care.They may want to celebrate other key workers who have kept the country going, such as refuse collectors, cleaners, teachers, supermarket workers, public transport staff, delivery drivers or, indeed, postmen and postwomen.Or they might highlight the volunteers who have helped in their local communities or raised money for charity, such as the late Captain Sir Tom Moore.The competition is open until Friday May . A special  of judges will select the winners. As with all special stamps, the final eight designs will be sent to HM The Queen before they can be printed and issued as stamps.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The shutdown means the loss of nine jobs at the plant, but local farmers believe the knock-on effect on employment will be even worse.Farmer and shareholder in the company Tony Archibald said: #It could mean the loss of another job on every dairy farm, not to mention the milk tanker driver.#The farmers are looking at ways of opening the creamery. It is very important because it is the one thing we have as a raw material for over here.#The farmers were due to meet as the Courier went to press to discuss ways of re-opening the creamery and they also plan to meet representatives of Scottish Milk.Mr Coffield described the closure as #devastating#. He said: #There#s not a lot of work round here. The main feeling about the place is disbelief.#The creamery produced about  tonnes of cheese a year.FIFTY YEARS AGOColour TV comes to CampbeltownColour television is to be launched in Campbeltown next Tuesday by Redfusion.And to mark the occasion, Redfusion is staging a demonstration exhibition in the town#s White Hart Hotel, where about six sets will be on view.The exhibition will be open to the public for three days.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The live action and CGI film tells of Peter#s latest adventures, this time out of the garden, where he finds himself in a world where mischief is appreciated, but soon his family comes to bring him home.Also hitting the big screen when the cinema reopens is the new part-live action and part-animated Tom and Jerry – the latest tale of the renowned mayhem-causing cat and mouse – and action-smash-fest Godzilla vs. Kong, a sequel to Godzilla: King of the Monsters and Kong: Skull Island.Coming in the next few weeks will be Nomadland, Minari, The Father, and A Quiet Place II.Alongside the newer films, the cinema has also rescheduled its #Thirty Films to See Before You#re Thirty# season, kicking off with Trainspotting and The Goonies.Ellen added: #Along with social distancing please ensure to wear your mask at all times in the building, except when eating and drinking in your cinema seat.#"},{"url":null,"title":"inez picks up prizes amid winning streak","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It#s a really exciting move as it offers the potential to climb the Scottish football pyramid.#From the club#s point of view, we want to find our standard amongst the new teams joining the set up.#We want to be the best we can be as the senior team of the Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.#With our acceptance into the WoSFL, we can offer a pathway for the youngest age groups right through to the under- side, being trained by Stuart Crossan, into our first team, representing Campbeltown in non-league football.#With that, it#s important to acknowledge the huge amount of hard work that has gone into making Campbeltown#s community club a Gold Merit Award holder, one of only seven clubs in the Scottish Football AssociationWest region, encompassing all of Glasgow and the west. This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance. Anyone who feels they are able to help can contact Campbell Robertson, club secretary.For more club updates, follow @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"budding young photographers make their mark","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Known only to the world mysteriously as #Pat#, he decided to part with his , bottle library last year, through a series of auctions, with a mission to share his passion for whisky with the world by passing his bottles on to new owners.Joe Wilson, head of auction content at Whisky Auctioneer, said: #Fèis Ìle is an iconic celebration of whisky and Islay culture that draws people back to the island year after year.#From Port Ellen to Bowmore and Bruichladdich to Ardbeg, this collection of Fèis Ìle bottlings is without a doubt the largest and most complete we have ever encountered.#The auction presents the rare opportunity for collectors and whisky drinkers to acquire some incredibly scarce malts that have been produced to celebrate the history of this iconic whisky region.#Examples from each of Islay#s eight single-malt producing distilleries feature in the sale, including complete collections of every single limited edition festival bottling from distilleries including Bowmore, Laphroaig and Lagavulin.The sale also features bottles that have been donated to the Fèis Ìle committee by distilleries to raise charitable funds for the island through their Islay Wave Project, which will focus on ways to support culture, artists and youth.Included in the charity lots is the oldest and rarest release directly from the iconic Islay distillery, Port Ellen. The Port Ellen -year-old # Rogue Casks# is the second release in the #Untold Stories# series, which explores the intriguing history of the Islay distillery ahead of its re-opening after closure almost three decades ago.Florence Grey, chairperson of the Fèis Ìle committee, said: #Fèis Ìle was delighted to be given the bottles in this charity auction from Diageo, plus a signed bottle from the legendary Islay whisky maker Jim McEwan.#All the proceeds raised from these bottles will benefit our island community as the funds will kickstart our Islay Wave Project # an ongoing project that will begin after this year#s virtual festival.#Focusing on ways to support our island#s culture, artists and youth, The Islay Wave Project concentrates on everything we celebrate throughout Fèis Ìle. We are grateful to Whisky Auctioneer for its support in bringing these bottles to auction.#"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession. He desperately wanted to find the soldier#s family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest, but having very little information, he struggled.#In  my father passed away and, being eager to finish what he started, I recently contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association to ask for help.#Michelle McKearnon, head of engagement at the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association, said: #We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier#s identity but only got so far. We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.#We#re now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.#Dr Armstrong added: #We are urging anyone who believes they know of or has any information about our #Unknown Soldier#, no matter how small, to get in touch.#This brave man fought valiantly for his country and to repay our debt to him for his service would be an honour, not only for Legion Scotland as custodians of remembrance, but for his family, Monsieur Prieur#s father, the people of St Valéry and, ultimately, for all the #unknown soldiers# who sacriced their lives for us.#Anyone with information that could help identy the soldier should visit poppyscotland.org.uk stvalery"},{"url":null,"title":"engines at the ready mach 1 stages rally gets go ahead","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They did notto the harbour until after pm with the casualty in tow.The following day, Sceptre skipper Tom Smith praised the hard work and efficiency of the Campbeltown leboat crews.Diver Robert Lamont, a member of the leboat crew the night before, went in and removed the damaged rudder ready for Sceptre to be towed by tug to Troon, the finish of the race.The race sails from Oban to Mull, Jura and Arran then Troon, stopping at each island for a team of runners to complete a hill race.Sceptre, with a crew of four, was carrying the boys# team from Glenalmond School, Perth.She had run aground the night before entering Craighouse, Jura. Everything looked fine on the yacht, which was built in Argyll at Alexander Robertson#s Holy Loch yard to compete in the America#s Cup of .#As a precaution, we did not have the boys on board for the tough leg round the Mull of Kintyre to Arran,# said crew member Roger Finbow.#They haven#t missed the race they were on board Blue Damsel, carrying the girls# team.#The decision proved a wise move as not only did the rudder come loose leaving the yacht with no steering, it was flapping wildly and in danger of damaging the hull.As a precaution, the leboat crew put a heavy-duty pump on board but this was not needed.HMS Dragon broke off her sea trials to come to the aid of Sceptre. The Type  Clyde-built destroyer stood by until the leboat arrived.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOCalls were mounting earlier this week for a Scottish Office decision on the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Office has been considering a business plan for state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the link with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland since the beginning of February.The company needs Scottish Office permission to become involved in the project.But concern is growing that unless a decision is made soon the necessary harbour work at Campbeltown will not start until it is too late for the service to begin next year.Two Campbeltown ambulance men were among six from Argyll recently presented with long service and good conduct medals by the Duke of Argyll.Ronnie Hamilton and Malcolm Black travelled to Oban for the presentation, carried out by the Duke on behalf of HM Queen.The medals are not awarded automatically but are made on the recommendation of a special .The Duke told the ambulance men: #What you do is not a profession, it is a vocation.#He also paid tribute to their families, pointing out the ambulance men worked anti-social hours for long periods at a time.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown was #switched on# to colour television on Tuesday by the town#s new Provost, William Craig, in his first official engagement.The service has been brought to Campbeltown by Redfusion, the firm which pipes television to several thousand subscribers from its mast at Crosshill Farm.The firm#s Scottish general manager Mr Colin Payne said that Redfusion offers a public service of which they were proud.#We looked at the television problems here. There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners. She had gone to Ostende for the fuel.A further restriction of the gas supply in the burgh comes into force on Saturday night. The hours during which there will be reduced and normal pressure respectively are given in advertisement.The local branch of the Miners# Union opened a subscription list this week for the purpose of starting a communal soup kitchen. It is not intended, of course, to confine the benefits of the scheme to miners or their dependents. Over £ has already been raised and the committee intend to publish the list of subscriptions next week.A welcome break in our comparative isolation from the mainland was made at the beginning of the week when the steamer Kinloch made a special run to the upper reaches, with mail, passengers and cargo.Many merchants, not only in Campbeltown but at Carradale and the west of Arran ports, were carrying very low stocks and this run was not made a day too soon to prevent absolute scarcity of not a few necessities.Flour, for one thing, was running very short, and the new supplies got by bakers were very much-needed.Alcohol is again tipped as a likely rival to petrol. The new motor fuel is being produced by the Distillers Company Ltd and consists of a mixture of  per cent of alcohol,  per cent of benzole and  per cent of paraffin. The idea of using alcohol is not new, but a fatal obstacle has been the unwillingness of the government to release its hold upon alcohol and permit it to be used for commercial purposes."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future. Any donation, however small, to celebrate our anniversary will help to save a le – just like the numerous lives we have already saved over almost , missions.SCAA vows to continue to transform emergency care in Scotland, particularly to our rural and island communities, with your support. Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in. But our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.The uncertainty during the Covid lockdown over access to basic shopping and medication, a lack of information in accessible formats, the social isolation, the barriers to being guided because of social distancing # these have all added to and compounded the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.But we want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.To contact the Need to Talk service, phone the RNIB Helpline on    or email needtotalk@rnib.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The only viable United Kingdom, now, is a looser kingdom at ease with its many identities and embracing its political ersity and by Mr Eslerrsquos ldquoHome Rule for All Nations will not be easy. But it is probably the last chance of saving the many good things about our United Kingdom, building upon the UKrsquos existing quasi-federal structure being the obvious way to proceed.Furthermore a reading of both reveals that the more rational Scottish nationalists recognise that in this day and age there can be no ldquoabsolute independence and as a consequence it is not entirely inconceivable that they and the ldquofederalists may not be so far apart when it comes to the crunch, the minorities of ultra unionists and Scottish nationalists being the only opposition to the achievement of a reasonable solution.And so the UK needs a Devo Max movement, the core of which is surely to be found in the Labour Party ldquowith Sir Keir Starmerrsquos idea of a constitutional convention being a reasonable first step , as Mr Esler suggests.John Milne, Uddingston.WHY SHOULD WE JUMP OFF A CLIFF NICOLA Sturgeon rightly said in her acceptance speech on re-election as First Minister, that those of who do not support independence cannot be ldquobludgeoned towards an outcome you have not been persuaded of.:Iain Macwhirter: Time to cancel university bosses who violate laws on free speechWith those words the First Minister sums up how it has felt living over the last many years in Scotland, for those who value what we share with our fellow citizens across the UK.Day in, day out, the heavy hand of Scottish nationalism has made its presence felt, badly mismanaging critical public services like education, whilst simultaneously seeking to impose a ldquowe-know-best attitude into many aspects of our lives. All the while, the SNP leadership has used every opportunity to stir grievance against the UK, promoting ision rather than recognising the benefits of working positively together.Despite warm-sounding political spin, the First Ministerrsquos acceptance speech reasserts the SNPrsquos determination to impose its will on the half of Scotland who oppose it. Meanwhile, we have no hint of clarity or honesty on reasonable concerns over the challenges the SNPrsquos overriding objective will likely mean for us.As some countries look forward to enjoying a period of calm normality once they emerge from the awful effects of Covid, our First Minister instead offers us a vision of ision and uncertainty.

This energy is either dissipated or stored in a iety of ways, with dferent outcomes, all governed by basic physical processes. The atmosphere behaves in line with the combined gas laws. Pressure, volume and temperature constantly interact.Kinetic is movement energy, of both wind and water. More atmospheric energy will mean more wind, bigger waves, and even faster or disrupted flows of ocean currents. A present benefit to us is that the Forth and Clyde are not icebound in winter.More kinetic energy means peak events like hurricanes are likely to be more powerful.Storm energy can be dissipated in electric storms like thundersnow, once rare, now frequent.Both atmosphere and oceans may absorb more heat energy, so temperatures rise.Warmer oceans hold more dissolved gases, becoming more acid. This can have a dramatic effect on marine lersquos ability to survive, corals being a sensitive le form. Corals store carbonates in their reefs. This is a knock-on impact. Fewer corals means less take-up of carbon. These feedback loops intensy climate change impacts.Warmer air in higher latitudes and altitudes will melt more polar and glacier ice. Oceanic thermal expansion will also cause sea level rise,it is not sea ice.The albedo effect ndash reflectivity ndash complicates ice loss impacts. Open sea, formerly ice-covered, absorbs more heat energy than highly reflective ice floes, thus allowing more rapid heat transfers in high latitude oceans. This then accelerates further ice melt.Another basic physical process ndash latent heat, or conversion energy, governs the melting of ice into water . Ice melting, in huge masses, requires a much larger energy transfer than just raising it from -C to C.Mass transfers of energy are needed to drive the hydrological cycle. Water vapour evaporates from the seas, condenses into clouds, then rain or snow.More energy can mean higher rain or snowfall. Additional cloud cover reflects more solar energy so we also have to account for a mitigating impact.Yet, some large air masses stall and produce longer periods of stable drier or hotter weather leading to droughts, and increased fire risk, especially in Mediterranean climates.These are all energy transfers. Feedback loops within these systems then either accelerate or slow processes. It isnrsquot a neat linear progression.Climate is the average weather over a -year cycle. Single weeks, months, even years can erge from the overall direction of longer term trends. Such is \"bias\" or \"noise\". No atmospheric scientist will say any single peak event is definitely caused by climate change. Yet over time more storms and powerful weather events are likely.One of the problems of climate change is that fish donrsquot see water.

No-one is actually harmed by this proto-censorship, apart from the students depriving themselves of the opportunity to learn. But things have taken a truly sinister turn in recent weeks.The lives of students like Lisa Keogh at Abertay, and lecturers like Dr Neil Thin at Edinburgh, are being destroyed by crack-handed inquisitions applying Monty Python concepts of justice. Lisa Keoghrsquos advocate, Joanna Cherry MP, has rightly condemned Abertayrsquos violation of the European Convention on Human Rights.:Michael Settle: The reinvention of Project Fear - but will it be a winning combination Highly-paid university principals should now be held to account for failing to defend free speech. Ms Keoghrsquos only crime was to express a wholly-respectable opinion in a debate. She insisted that ldquowomen have vaginas ndash an observation that is only a heresy to advocates of non-binary dogma.Dr Neil Thin was suspended from his role as a senior lecturer in anthropology for criticising the risible decision by Edinburgh University last year to ldquocancel Scotlandrsquos greatest philosopher by striking his name from the David Hume Tower. This for a footnote to an article in  that was disparaging about non-white races.Dr Thin was echoing the views of Scotlandrsquos leading historian, Sir Tom Devine. As former Rector of Edinburgh University I also expressed my dismay at this stupefying act of intellectual philistinism, which has made Edinburgh University an international joke. They had been intending to rename it ldquoJulius Nyerere Tower until someone pointed out that the late president of Tanzania was a homophobe as well as a dictator.I pointed out that its new official name, ldquo George Square, celebrates King George , an ardent imperialist who was responsible for an unprecedented expansion of British colonialism. But they didnrsquot get it.Many academics were horried at the Hume Tower affair, but they kept silent, terried of culture warrior retribution. Dr Thin also had the temerity to question whether a campus event called ldquoResisting Whiteness, which involved people of colour only, didnrsquot look just a bit like ldquosegregation. This elicited howls of protest at his ldquoracism.Any self-respecting institution of higher learning would dismiss such accusations as ridiculous. But principal Peter Mathieson suspended Dr Thin, following claims by students that his remarks were ldquoproblematic and ldquooffensive.What he should have done was censure the students who had called Dr Thin a racist, when he is clearly nothing of the sort. I have looked at the social media comments made by Dr Thin, and none of them could be regarded by any reasonable person as expressing racism. He said what any open-minded person would say about an event which was quite literally segregated on the basis of race. His support for Sir Tom Devine is what every self-respecting academic should have done.I donrsquot particularly blame the students of BlackED for mounting a daft, attention-seeking campaign. Thatrsquos what students do. But I do blame the university authorities for responding to it and validating what was in reality a campaign of intimidation and abuse against a member of staff. These extreme anti-colonialist and non-binary dogmas are usually referred to as ldquowoke, but they would be more accurately described as the sleep of reason. Universities are supposed to challenge dogmas and subject political ideas to rigorous criticism. Yet the university authorities seem to be falling over themselves to encourage these infant Robespierres with their empty slogans and pseudo-scientic jargon.:SNP urge Scottish Secretary to fight back or resign over Australia trade dealOver at Abertay University, principal Nigel Seaton last week defended his decision to conduct a disciplinary investigation into -year-old-mature law student Lisa Keogh for saying that ldquowomen have vaginas. This was in a debate where she was invited to state how she defined ldquowoman. She said that, in her opinion, it was essentially based on biology and a womanrsquos reproductive physiology. She also said that ldquomen are stronger than women on account of their sex, and that male-bodied transwomen should not be competing in womenrsquos sporting events. These are views that would be endorsed by the vast majority of adults, and indeed by Americarsquos leading transgender advocate, Caitlyn Jenner.Abertayrsquos response should have been to dismiss objections to her expressing these opinions in open debate. Yet, principal Seaton has authorised a disciplinary investigation into Lisa Keogh, threatening her with expulsion on the grounds that her views may be ldquooffensive and ldquodiscriminatory.:NEIL MACKAYS BIG READ: It was like Lord of the Flies - Horric accounts of abuse could be boarding schoolsrsquo lsquoMeToorsquo momentHe appears to believe that the university is under a legal obligation under equalities legislation to investigate complaints about comments that supposedly violate the protected characteristic of ldquogender reassignment.Principal Seaton is wrong. Equalities legislation does nothing of the sort. In fact, it upholds Lisa Keoghrsquos right to express her gender-critical opinion. This was made absolutely clear last month by Baroness Falkner, the new chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The views of feminists like Lisa Keogh are in no way discriminatory or hate speech. She said that it is ldquoentirely reasonable to believe that women are defined by their sex and no-one should be ldquopenalised or abused for saying so. ldquoSomeone can believe that people who self-identy as a dferent sex are not the dferent sex that they self-identy, she said.Arguably, it should be Abertayrsquos principal under investigation for conniving in this witch-hunt. In a dignied and restrained interview on BBC Womanrsquos Hour last week, Ms Keogh, a mother of two, explained the distress shersquod suffered being forced to defend herself against this Kafkaesque inquisition. In the midst of sitting her law exams she has had the threat of expulsion hanging over her. Not to mention the abuse she has received from student activists calling her ldquoa typical, cis white woman and much worse.These misguided and unlawful actions by university principals are creating a hostile environment in Scotlandrsquos universities. It extends far beyond Edinburgh and Abertay.The threat of sanctions or stressful disciplinary procedures is chilling debate and making lecturers hesitate to discuss controversial issues. Yet this is precisely what any university teacher should be doing. As for research,academics are looking over their shoulders at Twitter, nothing truly original will ever get done. Just a lot of advocacy research designed to confirm whatever prejudices are acceptable on social media.If universities do not enforce freedom of speech and opinion they cannot perform their proper . Scottish taxpayers expect them to do teaching and research ndash not pursue vendettas against wrongthink. Taxpayer-remunerated principals like Peter Mathieson, earning twice the Prime Ministerrsquos salary, are violating their own university charters, which uphold academic freedom and also free speech provisions of international conventions like the ECHR.:Heralds Higher Education Awards: Hard work and dedication pays off for finalistsNor do university bosses, minds addled by culture war, realise the reputational damage these cases are inflicting on their institutions.

And rightly so.Placed in a football context, this wasnrsquot just the equivalent of Scotland going to the Euros. This was the same as Steve Clarkersquos men qualying and then going on to win the whole thing. And you can just imagine how the nation would react were that to come to pass this summer.Taylor has benefited from two things that have allowed him to become undisputed world champion after just  professional fights.One was the World Boxing Super Series , an innovative knock-out style competition that brought together most of the key players in the super-lightweight ision without the usual contractual haggling and posturing that often gets in the way of big fights getting made.Taylor was named in the eight-man tournament that began in late , giving him a clear route to aim at two world titles.Defeating Ryan Martin in the quarter-finals gave him a shot at the first ndash the IBF belt ndash which he took against Ivan Baranchyk in Glasgow.He then added a second by defeating No. seed Regis Prograis in the WBSS final in London, a victory that earned him both the Muhammad Ali trophy and the Americanrsquos WBA belt.The second thing that went in his favour on the road to becoming king of the ision was meeting a like-minded foe in Ramirez.While others with two world titles to their name might have held off and continued to pad their record with victories against lesser opponents, both Taylor and the Mexican-American were willing to risk everything to gain everything.That both are part of the Top Rank stable again took any politics out of the move, with ESPN also already on board to broadcast the bout throughout North America.It evidently gnawed at Taylor before the fight that no major UK broadcaster had shown sufficient interest, a surprise given BT Sportrsquos collaborative partnership with ESPN.Again, there are possible mitigating factors behind that. Ramirez was a unied world champion but he isnrsquot a ldquoname among casual boxing fans in the way that Terence Crawford and Manny Pacquiao both are.If Taylor were to move up to welterweight to fight either of those pair, then broadcasters will be throwing money at him for the right to screen it.Ramirez is also not a natural showman, not a trash talker or someone who contributes more to the boxing hype machine than he is obligated to.When it did start to get a bit personal in the build-up to Saturdayrsquos fight, it was Taylor who was attempting to crank it up, admitting later it was all just part of an attempt to throw his opponent off guard.Broadcasters tend to reflect public opinion with their choices and perhaps there is a large element of English boxing fans who simply canrsquot bring themselves to get behind a chippy, patriotic Scot, as Taylor unashamedly is.He also doesnrsquot have an Eddie Hearn or a Frank Warren to repeatedly talk him up as they do with their own fighters, with Taylor now promoted by  year-old Bob Arum, a legendary figure in boxing circles but not a regular on Sky Sports News or in the British press.Just like Andy Murray before him, Taylor has had to almost go over and beyond just to grudgingly receive Middle Englandrsquos seal of approval.The  year-old had predicted people couldnrsquot continue to ignore himhe came through Ramirez and that has already proved to be the case.In the immediate aftermath, however, Taylor was less fussed about courting new admirers and more interested in thanking those who have helped carry him this far.Those include his family and friends, his fianceacutee Danielle, and his hero and mentor Ken Buchanan, the last Scot to be declared undisputed world champion  years ago.Buchanan is  years old now and not in the best of health, but Taylor has not forgotten how important a role his predecessor played in sending him on his way.ldquoKen, what an inspiration yoursquove been since I was  and walked in the doors at Lochend Boxing Club, he said.ldquoMy coach back then Terry [McCormack] is in Vegas with me and has been like a dad to me. But Ken gave me bits of advice on how to live my le.ldquoHe told me how to train and dedicate myself to my sport. He saw me as an amateur hitting the bags and said I could be a world champion.ldquoHersquos been proven right and I canrsquot wait to go back and say ldquoIrsquom just like you, champ.As for the future, Taylor is remaining open-minded. Crawford, who put on a clinical performance to take Ricky Burnsrsquo lightweight world title from him on a memorable night in Glasgow in , would be a massive draw home or away but there will be other opportunities, too.ldquoWersquoll see what comes my way, added Taylor, munching pizza and already looking forward to what would have been the first of many celebratory beers.ldquoWe wonrsquot be short of options and every fight is going to be huge. Wersquoll ride the wave.ldquoIrsquod like to go up to  pounds and chase a real big fight like Crawford. I wonrsquot call him out. Hersquos a great fighter but two undisputed fighters at  lbs would be amazing.ldquoIrsquove not boxed in my home city since Miguel Vasquez at Ingliston out by the airport a few years ago so Irsquod love to take a big fight back to Scotland.ldquoNow is the time to get Edinburgh Castle or Easter Road. Irsquod love to fight at the castle. It would be iconic.ldquoThere are big fights and good fighters out there. But Irsquoll fight anybody in this game.Hersquos already shown as much. They canrsquot ignore him any longer."},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-within-scotland-gap-health-richest-poorest-widening","story":"The dominant issues of the day, which still resonate, were as follows:I believed then that a truly Scottish model of healthcare would be to take a collective approach in which we generated strength from integration and transformation through unity of purpose. The people of Scotland sent me a strong message that certainty carries great weight ndash a commitment to ensure the timeliness and quality of care, fairly, for one and all.We made a series of practical recommendations all of which were accepted by the Scottish parliament, but which were perhaps somewhat lost in the politics of subsequent governmental change.Never has the world been more interconnected, geopolitically, by air travel, in cyberspace, genetically and through generation of knowledge by transnational cooperation.Our NHS is under extraordinary pressure at the moment, facing an unprecedented challenge posed by COVID , a challenge which crosses all borders and binds all nationalities together. For me,we are to meet thesechallenges, it requires us to embrace the ldquothree Cs of my original report: cohesion, collaboration and cooperation.How far have we come If recent data are to be believed, not far enough. The envisaged Networks in which we hoped to see a greater degree of site specialisation and a better access to complex care have not come fully to fruition.I felt at the time that Scotland had done some great work in terms of delivering integrated care through telemedicine to more remote communities and would have hoped that more progress would have been made with a greater degree of governmental support.Of course, many improvements have happened since I made my report. Importantly, we see that there have been improvements in outcome from the major chronic diseases, a tribute to my healthcare colleagues and their multi-disciplinarity of approach.But current data shows that some key outcomes are getting worse, not better. For example, the National Records of Scotlandrsquos most recent report shows that, after falling in every year from  to , avoidable mortality in Scotland has now plateaued .In , nearly a third of all deaths ndash % - were considered avoidable. And, within Scotland, the gap between the health of the richest and the poorest is widening. The % most deprived Scots are nearly five times as likely to die from an avoidable death as someone in the top %.This is up from . times more likely compared to .Back in , I invited over  Scots to town hall meetings to give voice to their own aspirations for their NHS and a recurrent theme was to ensure equity of access to healthcare, across any social, ethnic or other perceived ides.This is a multaceted problem which requires joined up thinking and joined up government, transcending Ministerial departments and a frankly better performance than current evidence dictates. When the gap between the rich and the poor is widening, we must act with a greater degree of urgency.First of all, cohesion.We need to improve networks across healthcare in Scotland ndash the journey that patients take when they enter the health and social care system.In practical terms, this implies investment in patient pathways that span primary and secondary care, networks of rural hospitals linked to and supported by the major teaching hospitals, rational distribution of services between neighbouring hospitals and national planning of complex service frameworks like neurosurgery and specialised childrenrsquos services.The technological revolution, accelerated by how we are dealing with COVID, can also support a more cohesive health service. Big data and articial intelligence in medicine allows us to build better health profiles and better predictive models around inidual patients so that we can better diagnose and treat disease and understand how iniduals access the health service, to better match capacity and demand.Health care cannot be something done to us with the help of technology, it must become a genuine partnership between health professionals and citizens. For example, the new wearables under development, track specic health trends, and relay them to the cloud where physicians can monitor them.Patients suffering from asthma or blood pressure could benefit from it, or monitors for blood oxygen levels to monitor COVID patients at home with alerts to signal when further treatment might be needed, all of which confer more independence and reduce unnecessary visits to the doctor.The remorseless process of natural selection was summarised in October  by Robert Brook of the RAND Corporation, one of the pioneers of the quality revolution  years ago, in a leading article in the Journal of the American Medical Association entitled lsquoThe end of the quality improvement movement ndash long live improving valuersquo.As we emerge from the COVID pandemic, the ensuing global economic crisis will push value further up the health agenda. In every country, lsquovaluersquo is the key concept, and increasing value by improving outcome and reducing expenditure are the key challenges for those who deliver healthcare and those who receive it.Secondly, collaboration.We are never more united than when we face an existential threat such as the COVID  pandemic. We see high level collaboration between the four Chief Medical Officers presenting a calm, united and rational front.I am honoured to work in Oxford and have witnessed the extraordinary efforts of my colleagues who have delivered an effective vaccine and who have conducted the largest and most globally informative trials of new COVID  treatments.Around , patients in  hospital sites across the UK have been randomised to nine treatment arms, or to receive no additional treatment. During the first wave, over , patients were recruited in just two months, making it the fastest-recruiting randomised controlled trial and, in the second wave, over , patients were recruited in three weeks, demonstrating the power of unity and the necessity for collaboration across the entire UK.In my own field, medical researchers can use very large nationally collected data sets on treatment plans and recovery rates of cancer patients in order to find trends and therapies that have the highest rates of success in the real world, leading ultimately to better patient outcomes.Finally, cooperation. The Covid crisis has revealed just how much we require all levels of government to cooperate together when faced with a deadly, common threat. Whether it is in the supply of personal protective equipment, the roll out of a massive new testing system, or the delivery of the vaccine, we have relied on political leaders to find common cause.Together with Gordon Brown and the Our Scottish Future think-tank, we intend to make further recommendations over the coming period on how deeper cooperation across the UK can support the delivery of better healthcare for all citizens.This isnrsquot a constitutional iding line ndash itrsquos about finding practical ways to get the best out of our health care system, be it in the supply of medicine, the application of technology, or the fight against a pandemic.I have taken this final slide from our report of all those years ago ndash as true now as then, and let me ask you to judge for yourselves how far the last  years have taken us towards this enlightened model of how we might better deliver health to all of our folk.David Kerr is Professor of Cancer Medicine, University of Oxford, Honorary Consultant Medical Oncologist, Oxford Cancer CentreProfessorKerr was author of the National Framework for Service Change, commissioned by the then Scottish Executive in  ndash the most wide-ranging review of how to help the NHS in Scotland manage future demand and improve health."},{"url":null,"title":"steve-clarke-must-make-settling-scotland-defence-euro-2020-priority-sunshine-spanish-sojourn","story":"A limited number of fans will be allowed in to Hampden for the Group D matches against the Czech Republic and Croatia at Hampden and England at Wembley due to Covid- restrictions. It will not quite be the same as in years gone by. Still, a sense of anticipation is growing among the Tartan Army daily.Clarke will spend his time at the La Finca Resort in Costa Blanca bonding with his players, assessing their form and fitness and generally fine tuning preparations for the friendlies against the Netherlands in Portugal and Luxembourg in Luxembourg and the finals thereafter.The trip promises to be absolutely vital to the nation teamrsquos chances or progressing to the knockout rounds for the first time.Anyone who attempted to come up with the names that Clarke would plump for before the squad announcement last Wednesday would have found the vast majority of them pretty easy.David Marshall, Andy Robertson, Kieran Tierney, Grant Hanley, Stephen OrsquoDonnell, Stuart Armstrong, Scott McTominay, Callum McGregor, John McGinn, Ryan Fraser, Ryan Christie, Lyndon Dykes and Che Adams will be all be hoping to start and are certain to be involved in the match day fit and available.But deciding on the centre backs to take was far more problematic. Who partners Hanley and Tierney in the three man defence that Clarke is likely to once again put his faith in is anyonersquos guess. McTominay will, with Ryan Jack and Kenny McLean both sadly injured, be deployed in his favoured position in central midfield. So who does the manager go for Liam Cooper has helped Leeds United finish th in the Premier League, Jack Hendry of Celtic started in the Qatar  qualiers against Austria and Israel in March, Scott McKenna has had a fine season with Nottingham Forest and is experienced, Declan Gallagher of Motherwell was sensational in the Euro  play-off semi-final and final last year.Each contender has his strengths and his weaknesses. Cooper, Hendry and McKenna, and even Hanley for that matter, have never wholly convinced onlookers at international level. Gallagher has. But the less said about his performances for his club this term the better. He hasnrsquot always been fully fit and didnrsquot feature at any stage in the last triple header as a result.Personally, I would abandon the three man defence and switch to a back four. Yes, the --- worked well in those play-off triumphs against Israel and Serbia. But Scotland looked far more settled when they reverted to a --- at half-time against Israel in Tel Aviv in March. They change allowed them to equalise and salvage what could prove to be a vital away draw.Robertson is far better as a left back than a wing back. It gives the Liverpool defender the chance to make the same sort of impact as he has for the Anfield club domestically and in Europe in the past. Tierney, Hanley and OrsquoDonnell appeared comfortable with it too. Having two deep-lying midfielders just in front of them offered vital protection.Every supporter, of course, has an opinion on what is best. But sorting out the defence is the biggest quandry that Clarke faces. It is one he must find a solution to by June .AND ANOTHER THINGChoosing the Manager, Player and Young Player of the Year before the outcome of the Premiership is decided and the Scottish Cup final has been played has led to some unfortunate moments over the years.Derek McInnes was declared the outstanding manager of the   season by both the Scottish Football Writersrsquo Association and PFA Scotland only for Aberdeen to be pipped to second spot in the Premiership by Motherwell on a dramatic final day.Many will argue that Callum Davidson of St Johnstone is more deserving of inidual honours than his Rangers counterpart Steven Gerrard following this weekendrsquos events.Davidson, who is in his first term as a manager, became only the second man after Sir Alex Ferguson and Alex Smith to lead a non-Old Firm team to a cup double when the Betfred Cup winners lted the Scottish Cup at Hampden on Saturday.He has certainly done superbly. But for me Gerrard has been a worthy recipient of every personal accolade he has received. He made history too when his team went all  league games undefeated. Not since the   campaign has an Ibrox team completed their top flight schedule without losing a match.The former Liverpool and England midfielder resurrected the fortunes of the Glasgow giants after one of the most troubled periods in their existence, ended Celticrsquos unprecedented spell of domestic dominance and prevented the Parkhead club from making history by completing -In-A-Row.Throw in consecutive runs to the last  of the Europa League and it is not a bad track record at all for another rookie boss."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11255016.jpg?type=article-full","title":"andrew-dunlop-stop-squabbling---strengthen-links-uk-scottish-governments","story":"If polls could express emotions then I like to imagine this is the kind of exasperation to which a poll published after the recent elections was giving voice.

Little wonder the population watches on wearily, itching to knock heads together.Nowhere is an inability to rub along more clear than in the fractious relationship between the Scottish and UK Governments.

Scottish ministers complain the UK Government disrespects their constitutional position.:Coronavirus: Pandemic: Take responsibility  Notyoure a Tory ministerAs in any troubled relationship both sides have a point. I recall extolling to a senior SNP leader the virtues of improving how the UK works. His reply was short and commendably frank: ldquoIrsquove no interest in strengthening the Union. And last year a senior UK Government lsquoinsiderrsquo vouchsafed to this newspaperrsquos UK Political Editor the thought that Boris Johnson ldquooutranks Nicola Sturgeon and ldquohas the pips on the collar.These remarks betray attitudes, which to outsiders appear petty and tiresome. The UK Government springs on devolved administrations a nasty surprise in the form of the UK Internal Market Bill. The Scottish Government refuses to collaborate on improving Scotlandrsquos connections with the rest of the UK. And wonrsquot play ball on developing Freeports, preferring exceptionalist Scottish Greenports ndash asports canrsquot be both free and green.For both, this is short-sighted. Separating Scotland from the rest of the UK is a very bad idea. However,thatrsquos your poison, is it really smart to demonstrate yoursquore incapable of working constructively with your nearest neighbour One whose currency you intend to use on departure, whilst leaving monetary policy in its central bankrsquos hands. And one on whose goodwill yoursquore relying to negotiate favourable lsquoScexitrsquo terms. Thatrsquos why Alex Salmond used to warble on about Scotlandrsquos place in six Unions ndash including a UK social union ndash and turning Scotland from surly lodger to good neighbour.If you think wersquore better together, then the job is surely to show Scots the value of having two governments batting for them that within the UK, Scotland doesnrsquot have to rely on a neighbourrsquos goodwill. Because when the UK Government negotiates with the Scottish Government a new post-Brexit subsidy regime, governance of the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, internal market exemptions or Scotlands fiscal framework, itrsquos not promoting Englandrsquos interests, but those of the whole country including Scotland.Fostering greater trust and confidence isnrsquot impossible. Building better relationships, however, requires investment of time and effort.Sadly, itrsquos not de rigueur these days to speak warmly of David Cameron.

There have often been trumped up charges brought against journalists and opposition politicians ndash places such as Turkey, Russia andUkraine spring to mind immediately, but less obviously repressive nations, such as Slovenia, Moldova, and Albania have also used such tactics against those critical of the authorities. The Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was murdered for investigating political corruption.Those cases are bad enough to make people who compare Covid regulations to Nazi repression, or regard the likes of Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson or, for that matter, Sir Keir Starmer as ldquofar-right look utterly ridiculous. But itrsquos not surprising that the citizens of comfortable Western democracies pay little attention to the internal politics of countries on what we think of as the fringe of Europe , nor even that our national politicians and the international community are reluctant to get too involved.It is an unfortunate fact about diplomatic relations that there are a lot of disagreeable regimes out there, and we usually feel that they have to be particularly obnoxious before itrsquos our job to do much more than moan ineffectually about their ldquodefective record on human rights.Plenty of worthwhile campaigning organisations and iniduals nonetheless do sterling work in drawing public attention to these abuses. Some cases, however, are so iniquitous that they quite rightly lead to demands for action from governments themselves ndash evenit is not always forthcoming.High profile political murders on foreign soil are the most obvious ndash a speciality of Russia, which has done or tried it several times in the UK and where, though also of Iran, which murdered two dissidents in the Netherlands, and Saudi Arabia, which had the critical journalist Jamal Khashoggi dismembered in their consulate in Istanbul.Belarusrsquos act of piracy against a commercial aircraft in order to arrest a critic is an outrage as blatant as that ndash and perhaps even more likely to lead to repercussions from other governments. The fact that civilians were endangered on a flight between two Nato and EU countries in a clear breach of all aviation law was, as the chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Tugendhat put it: ldquoIfhellip not an act of warhellip certainly a war-like act.He, and his counterparts from several other leading countries, have already called for all flights to and from Belarus, and through its airspace, to be suspended.

Like tarfs and trade wars, theyrsquore easily to call for and introduce, but ultimately damaging all round. In the case of Belarus, there is the added disadvantage of strengthening the countryrsquos ties with Russia, rather than encouraging it to move towards democracy and the West.But there is at least one form of them that is effective the so-called ldquoMagnitsky legislation to freeze of bank accounts and assets ofiniduals. This is the one tactic that seems to worry Vladimir Putin, who owes his position as an autocrat to his primary role as a broker between the competing plutocrats who are the real power in Russia.Every European country, whether in the EU or not, should take the most forceful stand on this issue the US also looks likely to take action.

If people are chided for choosing to go on holiday then they can point to the fact the airlines are selling tickets abroad.If the airlines are pulled up for the fact they are selling tickets abroad they can point to the government, which has given the green light for them to go ahead.If theres condemnation on the government for encouraging overseas travel then - get out of jail free - they can point right back to the people making the choice to go and say its all about personal responsibility.It feels like a blame game in the style of pass the parcel.Its hard to blame airlines for laying on flights to holiday destinations. The industry has been devastated by coronavirus - along with airports - and is looking at years of recovery ahead. Of course the travel industry is going to restart as soon as it can.This disconnect between the Scottish and UK governments is jarring also - caution here and encouragement there.Is leaving people to exercise common sense on this issue the best way forward in lockdown easing, particularly when those in charge cant decide Doors are already cross checked and to manual so we can but hope for a safe landing on the other side."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12621077.jpg?type=article-full","title":"covid-clackmannanshire-becomes-scotlands-latest-virus-hotspot","story":"Latest figures from Public Health Scotland show that over a seven-day period, the area stands at . cases per ..During a similar period, Glasgow - which remains the only council area in Level  restrictions - recorded . cases per ,.The average figure across Scotland is..Humza Yousaf, the newly appointed Health Secretary, admitted the rise in cases in Clackmannanshireis causing \"concern\".However, hesaid this could be due to the relatively low population in the council area.ldquoClackmannanshire has a really small population, so even four, five, six households testing positive can really make the numbers look like theyrsquore shooting up, he said.ldquoBut it is a concerning situation, Irsquom not going to lie to you about that ndash itrsquos one of the local authorities wersquore looking at and speaking to local health directors, can it be contained and can it be managed ldquoBut Clackmannanshire is one of the local authorities thatrsquos giving us a little bit of concern.Earlier, Mr Yousaf said this week would be \"critical\" for Glasgow ahead of another review of restrictions on Friday.:Half of Glasgow Hydro vaccine appointments were no shows over weekendHe said: ldquoTherersquos a range of data we look at.ldquoWe obviously want to see those cases per , falling, we obviously want to see the test positivity falling, we want to look at hospital admissions and also ICU admissions ndash I think thatrsquos quite critical and quite key.ldquoBut also what I want to hear from local public health directors is can they contain it  Can it be managed ldquoThe last thing we want to do iswersquore not quite sure, move Glasgow down a level only for in the weeks and months to come then we have to increase the level again and put them back into Level .ldquoThat yo-yoing effect isnrsquot going to help anybody at all.ldquoI donrsquot want to keep anybody in any level or any restriction for a minute longer than we have to but this week is going to be quite critical when we look at the data.Mr Yousaf said he was ldquoreticent to say ahead of time what the data would need to show for Glasgow to move into Level ."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12631579.jpg?type=article-full","title":"greens-call-scots-resist-home-office-immigration","story":"The Home Secretary revealed plans for a fully digital border to be brought in within five years, which would allow officials to ldquocount people in and count people out of the country.This, she said, would provide a ldquofar clearer picture of who is here, and whether they should be and allow the government to ldquoact when they are not.The plans come following demonstrations in Glasgow earlier this month when Immigration Enforcement officers attempted to detain two men in the south of the city.The Scottish Greenrsquos co-leader Patrick Harvie said people should take similar action in future to prevent the Home Office carrying out its ldquobrutal and inhumane plans.However, Ms Patel said the measures were to ensure greater security for the UKrsquos borders during a keynote speech at a think-tank conference yesterday morning.She explained: ldquoThose who play by the rules and seek to come to our country legally will encounter a system that is straightforward and fair.She said the system would work for the ldquolaw-abiding majority and against those who seek to ldquoabuse our hospitality and generous spirit.The American-style Electronic Travel Authorisationsystem announced yesterday will require visitors to the UK to obtain an electronic permit before travelling.

Well itrsquos certainly not what the Scottish or Glaswegian public voted for.He said that until Scotland was able to ldquobuild our own system, we can continue to resist the brutality of the Home Office adding: ldquoWe must resource our communities, so they are able to actively resist, and support those organisations who are operating on the front line to support asylum seekers, refugees and all migrants in our community.The SNPrsquos immigration spokeswoman Anne McLaughlin hit out at Ms Patelrsquos plans, saying ldquoScotland absolutely did not vote for these cruel immigration raids or any of the other toxic Tory migration policies.She said Scots wanted a ldquohumane migration and asylum system that works for Scotland based on fairness, dignity and respect."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12427469.jpg?type=article-full","title":"supermarket-sales-mouthwash-soar-socialising-returns","story":"However, as many finally ditch home cooking for newly reopened pubs and restaurants, supermarket sales have dipped compared to last year, when shoppers were stockpiling goods.Sales in the  weeks to May  compared with the same period a year ago fell .% to pound. billion, according to Kantar, although they remain pound. billion higher than pre-pandemic levels.:Voyage into retail shops for Scottish CBD firmCo-op and Iceland supermarkets took the biggest hit at the tills, with Lidl and Aldi enjoying the largest rises.Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: ldquoAs lockdown eases, people are ing to more normal habits and we can see that reflected in grocery sales.ldquoMany of us this time last year were eating all our meals at home and we bought extra food and drink as a result.ldquoNow wersquore seeing take-home grocery sales dip versus  as people are able to eat in restaurants, pubs and cafes and can pick up food on the go again, grabbing a sandwich, for example, while theyrsquore out and about at the weekend.He added that on-the-go grocery sales look set to be a signicant driver of growth for supermarkets over the next few months.:Cineworld flies out of the traps with Peter Rabbit Shoppers also felt more confident heading to stores again, with  million more visits to supermarkets compared to May last year, with the biggest growth in London where trips were up by a quarter.Data suggests that customers are ing to previous habits of making more regular trips, rather than doing big weekly shops as they were doing during the height of the pandemic, he added.The average basket size per shop has fallen for three consecutive months to pound. ndash the lowest level since before the pandemic and restrictions hit.Online grocery shopping also fell from .% of total spend in the sector to .% ndash although it remains higher than before the crisis and the number of customers heading to independent and convenience stores also dropped.:Scott Wright: Why Scotlands hotels are on the ropes ahead of crucial summer seasonMr McKevitt added: ldquoDuring the first national lockdown last year many people found solace in the early summer sunshine, something  has so far failed to deliver.ldquoThis saw sales of barbecue staples like burgers fall in May by % year on year.

This understanding is the philosophy behind the International Baccalaureate that the school offers, which introduces children as young as five-years-old to the concept that education does not take place in isolation but is relevant to le outside school.While lockdown has imposed challenges, staff at the school have continued to provide pupils with a creative outlet for any frustrations or negative feelings they may have experienced from being apart from their friends.ldquoThe biggest concern for me was the emotional well-being of the children so I tried to take time to have some fun with them, said music teacher Anna Dunsire.ldquoYou canrsquot start to try and engage them in learningthey are not feeling mentally well so the key thing for me was to do something fun at the beginning and get them dancing around.In her lessons she incorporates the Orff approach which encourages singing, games and exploration so that pupils attain a natural sense of creativity and musicianship. ldquoMy aim is to establish a passion, enjoyment and lust for learning music in all areas so I teach them in a way that engages their mind and body through a mixture of singing, dancing, acting and the use of percussion instruments, she said.Singing games can give a basic understanding of tonality which is then fostered by taking the tune onto xylophones. Anna knows the method is working when she hears the pupils using the singing games in the playground.ldquoThe approach is good becausechildren learn through fun it sticks more, she said. ldquoIf they enjoy it they will use it again and that reinforces the learning. Itrsquos quite a simple way of building up pieces that are in more unison parts.What they learn in music is connected to the outside world by, for example, the pupils creating their own Brazilian style Carnival. This took place recently with Anna handing over the ownership of the whole show to the pupils so they had to manage, market and cater for it as well as perform the music. ldquoThey thanked me for letting them do it because they felt a lot of value in doing it themselves and felt a sense of self worth and importance during the whole process, she said.Work for middle school students this year has also included creating a flashmob piece using unconventional instruments such as the cutlery in the school canteen.Meanwhile an older group is learning stringed instruments and enjoying practising both classical and pop tunes in their repertoire.ldquoLearning an instrument has been shown to have a very positive effect on the brain, pointed out Anna. ldquoIt also helps to calm your mind and takes stress levels down which of course was very valuable during the lockdowns. Music therapy with young children and the elderly is known to increase memories and bring a sense of calm. It helps students focus more and those who do not do so well academically often thrive in my classroom. We cater for all types of learner here.Drama and English are also valued highly at the school as ways of promoting good mental health as well as promoting creativity.ldquoChildrenrsquos mental health is such a focal point at the moment and it underpins much of what we are developing, said English and drama teacher Fiona Donald. ldquoWe are designing a new school planner with a wellness and mindfulness focus and for childrenrsquos mental health week we focused on activities to promote and celebrate self-expression and creativity.Studentsrsquo inidual talents are recognised, with the school offering offer many dferent ways of creative expression so that children learn to communicate their ideas through dferent media. They are also encouraged to venture out of their comfort zones to help build their confidence.ldquoWe think about risk in terms of climbing Everest but sometimes it is about standing in front of the class and reading your monologue, or acting asyou are a catwalk model, said Fiona. ldquoThis allows them to take small risks throughout the day and for them to be rewarded for that courage.Creative critical thinking is fostered by, for example, writing a st century version of the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet, where Julietrsquos concerns are Snapchat and Covid and Romeo compares Juliet to the light on his phone.Fiona also teaches Iniduals and Societieswhich is a mix of the humanities. This means she might introduce a topic like the industrial revolution through a piece of literature or, in her English classes, use some literature that ties in with the INS topic so that there is an understanding of the connection between subjects.ldquoAllowing that cross curricular understanding to happen organically is very powerful, said Fiona.Art and design teacher Munira Izbakieva, said the focus was on building skills that pupils could apply in any discipline. ldquoWhether it is art, music, language or science we foster basic skills and show connections between the ious subjects, she said.For example, the students might look at ious instruments and the concept of power in music, then make connections to the cubism art forms they are learning about in art.ldquoWe focus on the bigger concepts so students can make their own connections to the world around them, she said. ldquoIt gives them the opportunity to be open-minded and also apply freedom of expression in what they create.ldquoWe use a lot of tools to help them learn. Not everybody thinks they are good at art but we all have the creative spark within every one of us. We allow each and every child the opportunity to express their creativity and their iniduality.ldquoArt gives that opportunity to look within and find that still place that is always calm. It gives you the strength to cope with worldly matters.fairviewinternational.uk-----------------------------------------------------------Open Day will offer an insight into the Fairview experienceFOLLOWING months of challenges and disruptions, Fairview International School is now offering families the chance to visit the establishment in person as part of an on-campus Open Day.Adapting to the lsquonew normalrsquo, teachers had focused on ensuring that the digital classrooms were enhanced with interaction, collaboration and structure where the studentsrsquo school day was maintained.

We seek assurances, therefore, that  steps will be taken to ensure that this happens. Close collaboration with locally elected representatives, including the island authorities, will be important but we would encourage you and your officials to look at other ways of making sure this happens from the outset.“Needless to say, we would be happy to meet with you to discuss this matter in more detail.  Meantime, we wish you well in the substantial task that lies ahead and stand ready to assist, particularly in ensuring the needs of our islands are front and centre of government thinking.“We look forward to hearing from you in due course.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We did a huge amount of work including introducing a one-way system, social distancing measures and putting down markers,” said theatre manager Paul Baines. “One of the biggest challenges was getting people in and out safely.“We have to ensure the measures are genuine and effective and they are visible. Visible reassurance is important for customer confidence.“It is a juggling act because you have to balance creating a too clinical atmosphere with offering a unique theatre experience.”The theatre has been awarded the VisitEngland We’re Good to Go industry standard mark, signying that it adheres to government and public health COVID- guidance, also approved by UK Theatre Seat Safety.Alongside familiar COVID- safety measures, Rosie Fraser has introduced a new service called “Silent Treatment”.“We love a good chat but we also understand some people prefer not to,” said Rosie, whose beauty salon opened in .“Clients can see the service as soon as they look at the online booking menu and add it with whatever treatments they are having.“We still carry out a full consultation and then let them just relax.”Also in place are bespoke engraved screens between stations, extra time for cleaning, screening forms for track and trace, PPE and sanitising measures. Rosie emphasises that it is safety with style! Members of the seven-strong team are carrying out rapid COVID- tests at home thanks to the UK Government asymptomatic testing initiative.“We have exciting plans for this year in expanding. COVID- and lockdown has reaffirmed how much people need care and pampering to feel good.”Investment has helped Fish City in Belfast continue operating. The award-winning seafood restaurant extended its seating, installed outdoor heating and started a delivery service. Since reopening for outdoor dining, it has been doing a brisk trade bolstered by confidence in the vaccine programme. Reopening indoors is scheduled to start on May .“We created a dining room upstairs with a completely dferent feel,” said John, who owns the restaurant with his we Grainne. Safety processes include a digital thermometer mounted at the door which all staff and customers are required to pass before entering. Anyone recording a high temperature is refused admission.Hand sanitisers are also available. Kitchen and front of house staff are required to wear masks and wash their hands regularly. Tables and chairs are cleaned rigorously after every diner. The restaurant’s commitment to the safety is also seen in its recognition as COVID- Compliant by Tourism NI.“If I could do cartwheels, I would” is one retail chief’s response to welcoming the public back.“When we saw the first trickle of people coming back last month, it was lovely,” enthused village location manager Meurig Jones. “Portmeirion needs people here.“It’s lovely but it isn’t what it should be without people appreciating it. It’s easier this year in that it was such a new thing when we opened in July.“We had to do a lot of work to train the staff into a new way of working. We’re constantly improving and we’re learning as we go on.”App orders and one-way systems will ensure ongoing safety. Outside seating, pods and marquee are also available. Misting machines, meanwhile, will keep hotels “squeaky clean – safe for staff and guests”.Meurig added: “There’s hand sanitiser outside every shop and we ask people to wear masks indoors, but not outside.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Air Piracy. Playing Roulette with the lives of innocent civilians.Enough.Pratasevich and Sapega must be released.Today EU leaders decided on new sanctions  other forceful measures against the #Belarus authorities. #EUCO pic zzykFxlVHmdash Charles MichelMay , Mr Lukashenko has been president of Belarus since the post was established in  and won re-election for a sixth time in  with % of the vote, in a ballot deemed ldquoneither free nor fair by the EU.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the incident was a ldquohijacking.She said: ldquoThis is an attack on democracy. This is an attack on freedom of expression.ldquoAnd this is an attack on European sovereignty. And this outrageous behaviour needs a strong answer.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said it was ldquovery dficult to believe the seizure of Mr Protasevich from the flight could have taken place ldquowithout at least the acquiescence of the authorities in Moscow.He said that although the situation was not yet clear, the relationship between Minsk and Moscow suggested Russian leaders may have been aware of the plans in advance.The actions of the Belarusian authorities represent what appears to be a serious violation of international law on civil aviation.We are now advising UK airlines to cease overflights of Belarusian airspace. pic aHPZdcTzmdash Dominic RaabMay , In the Commons on Monday, he said: ldquoItrsquos very dficult to believe that this kind of action could have been taken without at least the acquiescence of the authorities in Moscow, but, as I say, itrsquos unclear as yet.Speaking to reporters later, he was asked why he believed it could not have taken place without Russia being aware, and Mr Raab replied: ldquoBased on all the circumstances. But we donrsquot know ndash it is just the proximity of the relationship between Minsk and Moscow.Ryanair boss Michael OrsquoLeary said the incident was a ldquostate-sponsored hijacking and claimed agents from Russiarsquos KGB were on board the flight.ldquoIt was clear it appears that the intent of the Russian authorities was to remove a journalist and his travelling companion.

It acknowledges the anxiety that some travellers may have.Loganair chief commercial officer Kay Ryan said: ldquoWe are delighted to play a part in helping showcase Shetlandrsquos stunning scenery and all the great reasons to visit this beautul part of the United Kingdom.ldquoWe are also extremely mindful of our passengersrsquo well-being, and full details of our lsquoFlysafersquo healthy flying protocols are available on our website, along with our lsquoFlexprotectrsquo programme which outlines our flexible bookings conditions as we continue to transition out of travel restrictions.Shetlanders Neil and Natasha Clubb took part in the filming ndash spending the day as ldquotourists enjoying the scenery and famed islesrsquo hospitality.Mr Clubb said being involved was great fun.ldquoWersquove not told many people about it so I canrsquot wait until my friends in Glasgow see it on the TV and realise that itrsquos us,# he said.ldquoThe filming experience was really good fun. We had a whole night in Fjara filming and then down in St Ninianrsquos Isle and up in Eshaness. It was fascinating seeing how the filming is done.ldquoI hope the advert encourages people to come up to Shetland and enjoy all that it has to offer. Therersquos lots of opportunities to get outdoors, from cycling and paddle boarding to birdwatching and fishing. It really is an adventure playground.Although the finished project looks spectacular, the Shetland weather added an extra challenge for Burra-based film-maker Stephen Mercer.He shot the footage in April, during the cold snap that left snow lying on the ground for weeks. Mr Mercer said it was an interesting project and added that, frosty conditions aside, the ldquoamazing locations helped sell the destination.Promote Shetland is stressing the need for all visitors to exercise caution when travelling this year and has published guidance urging all tourists to take two lateral flow tests before making their journey.The project was supported by the STV Growth Fund and match-funding from Promote Shetland and Loganair...Ive been a reporter since  at newspapers in Lincolnshire and East Anglia.

Shetland’s location, island transport links, industries and dispersed rural population, are all seen as contributing factors to this statistic.SIC environment and transport committee chairman Ryan Thomson said: “I’d urge folk to give us their views on how we can all work towards reducing Shetland’s carbon footprint.“This survey is the start of our ‘climate conversation’ and an open dialogue with the community, including local businesses, organisations and iniduals.“As we look ahead to recover from the pandemic, Shetland is well placed to support a greener recovery and we all need to play our part.”The online survey is open to all Shetland residents.

Decarbonisation can be a tricky business, some changes are easy but many of the changes that we need to make have a big impact on people’s lives, although not necessarily in a bad way.We should convene a Shetland citizens’ assembly.

The trio were cared for at the centre after a number of litters were seized at the port, with puppies being taken into the care of local dog rescues across Mid-Antrim.Originally four puppies were brought to the Ballymena Rehoming Centre by authorities, and were named Neo, Asher, April and Daffy by staff there. However, after receiving an initial vet check-up, they were found to have contracted parvovirus and despite best efforts by the team to help her, April sadly passed away. Conor O’Kane, Rehoming Centre Manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena said: “When they arrived, we could tell they had been through a traumatic experience and that something was wrong. We had them immediately checked over by a vet and after it was confirmed they had parvovirus they began treatment but unfortunately nothing could be done for April. “We believe they were under the age of eight weeks which is too young to be taken away from their mum or to undertake such signicant travel. After around four weeks of treatment, Asher, Daffy and Neo received a clean bill of health during that time, they had relaxed more and really started to come out of their shells. “It wasn’t long before we were able to find them new owners prepared to give them all the love and care they need to live happy lives, despite their dficult start in le.” Paula Boyden, Veterinary Director at Dogs Trust,said: “An ongoing and very serious issue that faces dogs and potential owners is the illegal trade of puppies. Alongside other animal welfare organisations in Northern Ireland, we have been campaigning for stronger and better enforcement of dog breeding regulations. “It is important that an improved, robust licensing system is developed in Northern Ireland in order to tackle unscrupulous breeders and sellers, alongside effective inspection of licenced breeders to ensure the welfare of dogs. As well as requiring every dog breeder to be registered or licensed, these credentials should be a legal requirement on any advertising that promotes the sale of dogs.” Every year puppies are illegally imported into Great Britain and mis-sold via online ads to unsuspecting dog lovers who think they are getting a healthy, happy home-bred puppy. Dogs Trust is urging potential dog owners to follow the charity’s responsible purchasing advice when getting a puppy:  Potential owners should always call the puppy seller beforehand and should never make any payment in advance of seeing or meeting their new pet  Pitfalls can be avoiding by not rushing into purchasing a puppy and following our buyer advice so potential dog owners aren’t ‘dogfished’. Always ask to see puppy and mum together at their home, evenits via video call to comply with coronavirus restrictions. Ask lots of questions and expect to be asked lots of questions as a good breeder will want to know where the puppy is going  All puppies should be microchipped at eight weeks old and registered to the breeder as the first keeper. Potential owners should be able to check whether paperwork such as pedigree papers, microchipping, proof of vet checks and vaccinations, all match  If, for whatever reason, something doesn’t feel right or you feel pressured into buying when you see or visit them, do not proceed and report to Trading Standards  We would recommend potential owners consider adopting a rescue dog before purchasing a puppy, howeveryou are planning on purchasing a puppy, then make sure you do your homework.

I got stuck in Co Clare for Covid,” said Conni, who had been performing as a full-time harpist when the pandemic saw her ability to earn disappear overnight.“When it all happened we thought it would be a couple of weeks so I went there and figured it would be a nice place to hang out for a short while,” she said. “As it became more and more apparent that the music industry wasn’t going to be coming back in a hurry, I started looking at my other options and decided to go back to university.”While that may have seemed an easy decision to make, the reality of what she would be facing soon became apparent.“As I was at my parents’ home during Covid I’m not eligible for funding for university. If it wasn’t for the van then I just wouldn’t go as I’m not willing to take out a loan to pay for housing for four years.“I thought I have the van, why not  I can make this work.”Far from slumming it, Conni’s converted van comes equipped with a kitchen, living room and a bed.“It’s a big van. It’s kitted out with everything I need apart from a shower,” she said. “But I’m hoping to be able to use the facilities on campus at the university.”The only other obstacle is where to park it up when she is in the city.“The student’s union at UCD has already been in touch and will be trying to help arrange a parking permit,” she said.“That would be great. I’m hoping I can park there during the day and drive out and find somewhere to park it for the night.”She did admit to being wary of being branded as a ‘traveller’ though.“You don’t want people knocking on the door and asking you to move on,” she said.“I’ll try and be inconspicuous and not stay in any spot too long. I hope they’ll understand I’m a student who can’t afford anything .”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadMark Allen goes from black to red: Snooker star declared bankruptAlarm as motorist drives on wrong side of Belfast to Newry A carriagewayPiers Morgan offers to bury hatchet with Van Morrison over Irish coffees in BelfastLisa SmythOpinionA holiday  You’ll need one after trying to get your head around Northern Ireland’s travel guidance Retired cop targeted by New IRATop VideosPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayVideo: Doors open as Northern Ireland restaurants and pubs welcome customers inside again\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cbe-ca--ac-aae_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cbe-ca--ac-aae_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPoll puts the DUP on just %Latest Education‘Great day for children’ as MLAs back calls to ban pupil restraintPay teachers what they’re worth: unionMP urges Ulster University to seek an apology from Hall in wake of Di stormThe unassuming man who left Methodist College Belfast £m in his will Exams grading process a disaster waiting to happen, says SDLP’s McCrossanLatestCallum Reid was always set to follow Inst team-mates into Ulster’s senior side, says Dan SoperNew advice for Indian iant hotspot areas is not ‘out of the blue’ – CoffeyShayne Lavery ‘shocked’ to land first ever Ulster Footballer of the Year double as  hail ‘humble and outstanding’ Linfield strikerGlentoran boss Mick McDermott stands by his January call to void the Irish League seasonKey figures highlighted in report into allegations of Tory discrimination,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When you add in those patients waiting for their first consultant appointment, one in four people in Northern Ireland is on a waiting list.“Northern Ireland’s leaders are now faced with a choice. They can either continue to let things spiral out of control, or they can use the easing of Covid- pressures as a turning point, an opportunity to do things dferently and get our health service, and in particular waiting times, back on track.”He added: “We must ensure that no matter where a patient lives in Northern Ireland they can expect the highest quality of surgical care.“Surgeons have already demonstrated great flexibility in adapting to the challenges of Covid- and the limitations placed on capacity.“Protected surgical beds, Covid-light sites, a strong surgical team and surgical hubs are key parts to any meaningful solution.“The Royal College of Surgeons stands ready to work with all stakeholders in delivering a surgical service fit for the st century.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fd-cf-a-da-ecbbe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fd-cf-a-da-ecbbe_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fd-cf-a-da-ecbbe_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fd-cf-a-da-ecbbe_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNorthern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann Mr Swann said: “Sustained additional funding is not the answer by itself – but we cannot start fixing waiting lists without it.“I look forward to further constructive engagement with the Royal College as we continue to work together on this most pressing of issues.“Our appalling waiting lists must now become one of the Executive’s greatest priorities.“A decade-long period of under-investment had contributed to a totally unsustainable gap opening up between demand and capacity.

You could be forgiven for thinking officials want to make travel as dficult as possible.At the same time, the UK and the Republic of Ireland have two dferent traffic light lists which are constantly in flux, depending on the changing landscape in dferent countries around the world.For example, currently anyone flying into the Republic of Ireland from Canada or the US has to stay in managed quarantine, whereas anyone arriving into England from both countries only has to isolate at home for -days.There’s no obvious reason for the disparity and it certainly adds to the whole confusion around foreign travel and what is and isn’t safe.The desire for some summer sun after a long, miserable lockdown in Northern Ireland is understandable — but a holiday is even more of a necessity after trying to navigate the rules and advice relating to travel during a pandemic..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadMark Allen goes from black to red: Snooker star declared bankruptAlarm as motorist drives on wrong side of Belfast to Newry A carriagewayPiers Morgan offers to bury hatchet with Van Morrison over Irish coffees in BelfastLisa SmythOpinionA holiday  You’ll need one after trying to get your head around Northern Ireland’s travel guidance Retired cop targeted by New IRATop VideosPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayVideo: Doors open as Northern Ireland restaurants and pubs welcome customers inside again\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cbe-ca--ac-aae_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cbe-ca--ac-aae_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPoll puts the DUP on just %Latest Northern Ireland£bn needed to tackle surgical waiting lists, says reportSDLP hits out at ‘unjustiable’ pay increase for Antrim and Newtownabbey councillorsEx-Alliance councillor who claimed ‘racist under-current’ in party before DUP defection dies suddenlyCharity to restore woodlands in Mourne estate‘Great day for children’ as MLAs back calls to ban pupil restraintLatestCallum Reid was always set to follow Inst team-mates into Ulster’s senior side, says Dan Soper£bn needed to tackle surgical waiting lists, says reportBBC must continue to break ground in journalism, says director-generalNew advice for Indian iant hotspot areas is not ‘out of the blue’ – CoffeyShayne Lavery ‘shocked’ to land first ever Ulster Footballer of the Year double as  hail ‘humble and outstanding’ Linfield striker,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsBelfastPension SchemeA MediahuisWebsitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty Didomi.preferences\" href\"#\" style\"cursor: pointer position: fixed background:padding: px px color: #ffffff display: flex align-items: center max-height: px z-index:  bottom: px right: px border-top-left-radius: px border-top-right-radius: px\" Privacy"},{"url":null,"title":"alarm as motorist drives on wrong side of belfast to newry","story":"Shocking: A driver on the wrong side of the A outside Newry FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueShocking: A driver on the wrong side of the A outside NewryStaff ReporterMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThis was the worrying sight as a car headed the wrong way on one of Northern Ireland’s busiest roads.Footage appears to show the silver coloured vehicle travelling in the wrong carriageway of the A, which runs from outside Belfast to Newry.It is believed the footage was taken by a passing motorist over the weekend.The clip, lasting less than  seconds, was circulated on social media yesterday.It shows the car travelling on the left side of the wrong side of the road, as traffic pulls on to the other lane to avoid a collision.At one stage, a lorry — which was heading directly towards the car — flashes its lights repeatedly to warn the driver of the potential danger before slowing and pulling into the other lane.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDaniel Kinahan.Ralph HewittTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailTwitter has admitted it temporarily barred Belfastpolitical editor Suzanne Breen in error for the second time in just one month over a tweet about Dublin crime boss Daniel Kinahan.Ms Breen’s Twitter account was blocked at the beginning of May due to a tweet from February in relation to a BBC Panorama documentary on Kinahan. Twitter apologised on that occasion and said enforcement was taken in error.Read MoreTwitter criticised for blocking journalists over Daniel Kinahan postsHowever, after Ms Breen’s account was locked for a second time over the same tweet, she said there are “serious questions” Twitter must answer.“Twitter must explain why it has banned a journalist twice in one month for a legitimate and lawful tweet about Daniel Kinahan,” said Ms Breen, whose Twitter account was reinstated yesterday evening.“Its swt action over a tweet about a crime boss stands in stark contrast to its slow and lacklustre response when abusive and bullying comments are made about less powerful iniduals. Last time, Twitter said an ‘error’ was responsible for my account being suspended. It would be stretching credibility to say the same error occurred again.“Twitter needs to find answers quickly. Otherwise, it looks like it’s attempting to silence media writing negatively about Daniel Kinahan.” Kinahan , who is now based in Dubai, has no criminal convictions but has featured in investigations by the National Crime Agency and law enforcement organisations across Europe.He was named by Dublin’s High Court as the leader of the so-called Kinahan cartel, a criminal organisation involved in “the importation and distribution of controlled drugs and firearms within this jurisdiction”. The Criminal Assets Bureau said he “controlled and managed” the operations of the cartel.A spokesperson for Twitter said last night: “In this case, we took enforcement action on the account referenced in error. “This action has been reversed and access to the account has been reinstated. Protecting the health of the public conversation is important to us, and we’re constantly iterating and improving our work here and will continue to be vigilant.”BelfastEditor-in-Chief Eoin Brannigan said: “Twitter’s claims that protecting the health of the public conversation is important to them and that they will continue to be vigilant ring completely hollow when you examine the facts in this case. They must explain on whose word they acted in locking Suzanne Breen’s account not once but twice.

Credit: Liam McBurneySuzanne BreenTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailArlene Foster had recently discussed removing Edwin Poots as Agriculture Minister, Stormont sources have said.The outgoing First Minister considered moving DUP junior minister in the Executive Office, Gordon Lyons, into the agriculture portfolio, but then decided against it, insiders said.Read MoreSuzanne Breen:OpinionLong runs the fox, as farmer Poots knows only too well...The DUP Executive will meet in a Belfast hotel on Thursday night to raty the election of Mr Poots as leader. The meeting, at which there will be social distancing, will be attended by five represenatives from each of the DUP’s  constituency associations the  MPs and MLAs who made up its electoral college and the party’s five peers.With Mr Poots’ close ally, Paul Givan, one of those in the running to be appointed First Minister-designate next week, the Speaker’s Office has been asked what would happen his private member’s bill to prevent abortion being carried out here in cases of non-fatal disabilities, including Down’s syndrome.The issue has been raised at Stormont. Some MLAs are concerned that the legislation, which has passed onto the second stage, could fallits proposer is no longer a backbencher.“That wouldn’t go down well with our voters,” one said. “It is an extremely important issue to them, and Edwin himself has described abortion as a defining issue for him. It should come ahead of promoting any inidual MLA.”Other DUP sources said they were confident that the bill would progress evenMr Givan was appointed First Minister. They noted that a private member’s bill by former SDLP MLA Conall McDevitt on reducing speed limits had been allowed to continue after he resigned in .The insider said that although the Speaker “could not rule hypothetically”, the party had confidence that the abortion bill could be progressed by another MLA  Mr Givan was made a minister. They believed the Speaker “would raty that process”.Read MoreEdwin Poots ‘will not hasten Arlene Foster’s exit as First Minister’And the scenario of a minister themselves taking forward a bill that they had proposed originally as a backbencher had never been tested, Stormont insiders said.An Assembly spokesperson said that “there has never previously been a scenario of a member becoming a minister while their private member’s bill had already begun its passage through the Assembly”.They added: Should such a situation arise, the Speaker will determine at that point how the matter will be managed procedurally.”Meanwhile, Mrs Foster has questioned the existence of a letter at the centre of an internal party coup against her. The document reportedly signalling no confidence in her leadership was reportedly signed by the overwhelming majority of MLAs.The outgoing First Minister, who has said she intends to remain in office until the end of June, said she hadn’t seen the “so-called” letter and did not feel under “any pressure” to leave office earlier.I haven#t had the opportunity to speak with Edwin yet but I#m sure, when I do, we#ll discuss all of those matters, she said.He hasn#t been speaking to me as yet and actually I still have yet to see the letter, so-called, and I#m beginning to wonder is there a letter at all but, in any event, I look forward to seeing the letter and I look forward to having that conversation whenever Edwin reaches out.Mrs Foster said the letter was supposed to be signed by  of my colleagues.She added: Some of my colleagues are indicating they were told they were number , even though a number of them had been told that, so I would quite like to see the letter just from my own point of view to see what#s in it.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadMark Allen goes from black to red: Snooker star declared bankruptAlarm as motorist drives on wrong side of Belfast to Newry A carriagewayPiers Morgan offers to bury hatchet with Van Morrison over Irish coffees in BelfastLisa SmythOpinionA holiday  You’ll need one after trying to get your head around Northern Ireland’s travel guidance Retired cop targeted by New IRATop VideosPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayVideo: Doors open as Northern Ireland restaurants and pubs welcome customers inside again\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cbe-ca--ac-aae_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cbe-ca--ac-aae_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPoll puts the DUP on just %Latest PoliticsSDLP hits out at ‘unjustiable’ pay increase for Antrim and Newtownabbey councillorsEx-Alliance councillor who claimed ‘racist under-current’ in party before DUP defection dies suddenly‘Great day for children’ as MLAs back calls to ban pupil restraintMalachi O#DohertyOpinionIt’s our fixation with identity politics that needs to change Unionist peer Lord Maginnis hits out at U-turn by NIO over Lewis inviteLatestDentists threaten to ‘go private’ or ‘reduce NHS commitment’ as they urge reformRecord one in three homes being snapped up for over the asking priceCallum Reid was always set to follow Inst team-mates into Ulster’s senior side, says Dan Soper£bn needed to tackle surgical waiting lists, says reportBBC must continue to break ground in journalism, says director-general,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDeputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill of Sinn FeinGareth CrossTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailDespite their recent troubles Sinn Fein#s popularity shows no signs of declining, with the party on course to emerge triumphant following next year#s Assembly election.The party has been subject to repeated criticism over their role in the funeral of former IRA man Bobby Storey, and an internal investigation in Londonderry has seen two MLAs, including senior party figure Martina Anderson, asked to stand down.Regardless, a new poll from LucidTalk for the Belfasthas Sinn Fein on course to become the Assembly#s biggest party at the next election, with Michelle O#Neill set to become First Minister.One quarter of the electorate in Northern Irelandsaid they would vote for the party as their first preferencea snap election was held.The poll puts the party % ahead of its nearest challengers, the DUP and Alliance, both on %.Sinn Fein#s support has increased % from our last poll in January, while the DUP has fallen another %, with the poll conducted between May -, just after Edwin Poots became DUP leader.It will likely prompt big questions for Mr Poots and his UUP counterpart Doug Beattie with a Sinn Fein First Minister long regarded as a devastating psychological blow to unionism.One approach the parties may consider could be a unionist voting pact.While such approaches have had limited success in the past, during the DUP leadership contest Mr Poots said he wanted to hold a unionist convention ahead of the next election to maximise unionist representation.Supporting any pact will be a tough choice for Mr Beattie, his predecessor Steve Aiken#s reign as UUP leader was seriously undermined after he backtracked from a vow to contest all  Westminster seats in the December  General Election to allow Nigel Dodds a solo unionist run in North Belfast.TUV leader Jim Allister has already expressed his support for unionist parties to work together toas many anti-Northern Ireland Protocol MLAs as possible.Our poll makes better reading for Mr Beattie and Mr Allister, with the UUP up % to % and the TUV up % to %.While the Alliance Party remain in the race to become Northern Ireland#s second biggest party, there are suggestions their popularity may be waning slightly with a drop in support from -%.However, % would still be a massive result for the party who polled just .% in the  Assembly election.Despite respondents finding SDLP leader Colum Eastwood Northern Ireland#s second most competent political leader, and a young Assembly team, the party continue to struggle to make headway with voters.Our poll now has the SDLP behind the UUP and just ahead of the TUV with % of the vote. The party has fallen % from our January poll, but remains just ahead of its .%  Assembly election result.Extensive rebuilding work in the last few years appears unable to entice new voters, but the party continues to maintain its loyal base.The Greens, People Before Profit and others and independents all sit on % of the vote. How the polling was carried outPolling was carried out online from .pm on May  to pm on May , targeting the established Northern Ireland LucidTalk online opinion  , and which is balanced to be demographically representative of Northern Ireland. Some , full responses were received, and these were ‘weighted down’ to a , NI representative data-set used for analysis in terms of the final results. Data was weighted by age, sex, socio-economic group, previous voting patterns, constituency, constitutional position, party support, and religious affiliation.

Staff from Rosemount Resource Centre have written a letter of no confidence to Derry City  Strabane District Council which questions the suitability of a ‘new management committee’. Ten workers who signed the no confidence letter say they have provided a collective  years’ service to the local community. A list of grievances and concerns are laid out in the letter over two and a half pages. They include allegations of bullying and harassment in the workplace, mis-use of funding, closed Annual General Meetings , concerns of ‘family collusion’ and a lack of knowledge in terms of financial reports. googletag.cmd.push In addition, it details the removal of committee members from an investigating  to ‘manipulate the outcome of grievances’, ‘victimisation’ of staff and exclusion of the community from decision-making. The letter says that all complaints can be backed up with emails, minutes and testimonials. “Staff are now feeling unhappy, vulnerable and threatened to be in their place of work. “This is having a devastating impact on our health, leading to us being unsure of what our future holds as community workers,” the letter adds. In conclusion, the staff say the situation will not be tolerated any more. The Derry News has since viewed correspondence from management which was sent to signatories of the ‘no confidence’ letter. googletag.cmd.push They have been called to an investigation in relation to their ‘participation in a letter sent to public representatives and others containing serious allegations’. It aims to establish facts and gather evidence relating to the allegations. Iniduals were given the right to trade union representation at the meeting or they can be accompanied by a colleague who is not involved in the investigation. Those invited to attend were told to keep the investigation confidential and thatthey breached that order it could be considered a disciplinary matter. Representing staff, Niall McCarroll of Unison said: “Workers at Rosemount Resource Centre should be valued as important stakeholders in how it is run and to ensure it meets the needs of the local community.”     Derry City  Strabane District Council was asked what action is being taken in relation to the allegations made. In response, a council spokesperson said that it is aware of concerns and is in the process of ‘collating and compiling information’ as part of a preliminary assessment of the situation. The spokesperson added that it would therefore be inappropriate to comment further at this time.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The esteemed Man United left back and England international, has congratulated -year-old Ainara on her winning entry in the Ulster University and Manchester United Foundation competition. The two organisations have worked in partnership together since , but this is the first competition of its kind. With a full-time Foundation officer based at the university’s Magee campus, the partnership focusses on delivering positive outcomes by providing experiences and opportunities for young people across the Foyle Learning Community. googletag.cmd.push Ainara’s prize included two tickets plus travel to watch a Manchester United game - once normal spectator matches are able to resume. Runners-up will receive Manchester United goody bags. In order to win this prize Ainara and other post primary students from the Foyle Learning Community were challenged to research, design and map financing for a product, which could be sold in the Manchester United Megastore. Ainara came up with the clever concept of a mini, portable projector, which could be plugged into a phone, providing the user with the ability to watch a football match anywhere from the back garden to the local park. googletag.cmd.push The concept was especially apt given that friends can’t currently meet indoors to watch the game together. The students’ ideas were presented to a  of judges who picked Ainara’s innovative product design as the winner. Speaking after learning the news,Ainara said she cannot wait to see all the players. I have never been to a proper football match before so I am really looking forward to it. I love being part of Manchester United Foundation and joining in with all the projects,” she added. Malachy O’Neill, Ulster University Provost, Magee Campus, congratulated the young Derry girl on winning the inaugural competition.     He said: We’re thrilled to have the Foundation hub now up and running at our Magee campus and look forward to creating many more exciting opportunities for the pupils in our partner schools across the city and beyond.” John Shiels, Manchester United Foundation CEO, added: “Congratulations Ainara on winning our first ever Ulster University Foundation competition. I really look forward to welcoming you to Manchester and to Old Trafford. With the innovation of your winning product, you have set really high standards. It is the aspiration of this partnership to engage and inspire many others to follow you by getting them to participate in the many programmes and projects we intend to offer in the future”. Meanwhile, Matthew Lewsley, the Foundation’s school partnership officer at Ulster University, expressed his delight to be working within Schools Outreach at Ulster University to deliver projects and engage with young people across the Foyle Learning Community in Derry. We are really looking forward to providing further opportunities in order to enrich our school’s outreach and development across Northern Ireland.” WATCH: Luke Shaw announcing the winner:https:www.youtube watch vZsocyovVY  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I’m talking about no money for food, no money for heating, sleeping in a sleeping bag under the covers with multiple jumpers on poor. googletag.cmd.push A combination of my mother’s pride and my father’s selfishness created a situation where I lived in a wealthy part of town but went hungry every day for many years. I was also badly bullied but my school did nothing about it, despite it being clear what was happening. Anyway, during this time, three things saved me. One was a teacher involved in the library and other library staff who allowed me to be in there when I really shouldn’t have been. They let me be myself and kept me safe. Years later I had the chance to express my thanks to the we of this lovely teacher with tears in my eyes. googletag.cmd.push She told me many people felt that way about his kindness and she was glad I found a safe space thanks to him and the other staff. Second was the VP, a formidable woman whom few dared to cross. She spotted how thin I was, how my unorm wasn’t the cleanest and was shabby and threadbare in places. She brought me into her office, asked some questions about my mother’s income and gave me forms to complete so I could get free school meals. She knew by my face that I didn’t feel safe ulging the information to her so she told meI had to, steal the information I needed, bring her the forms and she’d post them for me.     She showed me unbelievable kindness that day and thanks to her, I had one decent meal a day from then on. It was often the only time I ate in any given day. Thirdly, a wonderful, funny, joyous and kind woman who worked in the canteen would pile my plate up each day and sneak me extra desserts. On Fridays she’d stuff my pockets with whatever sealed food she could, risking the ire of thecanteen manager and quite possibly her job but thanks to her, I had food I could eat at the weekends. She lived nearby and every time I passed her house, even to this day, I think of her and give thanks for her fierceness and kindness to me. So thank you to JT, MT and PB for helping me through some of the toughest and dficult years of my le. You won’t remember me but I give thanks to you all more often than you’d realise.

He waves a cursory greeting and continues on his way. In the time it takes me to gather everything I need together, he passes me again, his step count no doubt rising with every lap of the town. Zoom. Walk. Laptop. Bake. Netflix. Repetition has become endemic over the last year, but its something Moneymore cant be accused of. There is a unique feel to the fronts of the buildings that greet me as I walk around the town. Even the post office, now boarded up, remains unbranded. googletag.cmd.push Moneymores terrain gives the town a layered effect. The pillared entrance of The Manor House provides the backdrop to the towns mini roundabout, welcoming motorists coming down the hill from Smith Street. Rusty scaffolding frames a construction site on my left as I make my way down. A woman waters potted plants in her compact front garden. The distinctive smell of curry is emanating from the two Chinese restaurants at the bottom of the hill. Shutters are down on Antonios pizza, yet to open for the day. More scaffolding sits alongside buildings in mid-construction off High Street, but no work appears to be going on today. googletag.cmd.push Along Lawford Street there are ersion signs in place as Council staff busy themselves in resurfacing the Turnaface Road. The grating sound of the road roller echoes off the houses that line the street leading back to the town centre. You could describe Moneymore as ornate. Older, unique buildings, set at dferent levels, create a layered backdrop, crowned by the spire of St John and St Treas church on the top of the hill.  The hum of a small aircraft passing overhead and the unmistakable smell of freshly-cut grass adds to the sense of a town taking new-found pleasure in the mundane.     A pregnant sky threatens rain. Taken a dip I nip into The Mane Barber Shop, where a neon sign declares the shop open for business. Owner Pauline McGarvey is at her lunch. She says reopening has not been the silver bullet the industry was hoping for. “This week has been terrible. For the first seven days [after reopening] it was great, but its taken a dip again,” she tells me. “The older folk that keep you going – your pensioners and farmers and that during the day – they havent been about the same. A vintage tractor model welcomes visitors to the town from the Tyrone side. “It was a gamble coming into a small town. You do have a bit of passing trade but youre hoping people are going to come in from the likes of Coagh, Lissan and Loup. “I said I would give it six months and see how it turns. Its fine, but its not busy. You have that fear of whether its going to come back.” Pauline has been in Moneymore three years, and until the pandemic ruthlessly attacked all businesses, things had been going well.  has seen a seismic change across all industries, driving many hair and beauty professionals off the high street altogether. “Lots of people are working from home and I have to admit, Im tempted,” she says. “Youre still going to be hit with rates, and you havent stopped paying your water bill, your electricity, your rent. “Yes, we got a bit of help, butyouve no customers in, then that money is all going to go and you still have to find wages too. “Ive seen a lot of hair and beauty people who havent gone back from the first lockdown.” Humanity adapts though, and over the last year, Pauline has embraced the situation in which the world found itself. She got married in February, and has enjoyed the extra time with her family. Keeping an eye on litter in the area. “It was the first time in my le I could actually say I was a mummy. I loved spending time with the weans,” she says. “It felt like wed a whole  years wrapped into one year. It is nice getting back though, you need the routine. Its bittersweet in a way.” Cookstown native Pauline says lockdown has really hit young people in the area hard. Her daughter, Danielle, is in Year , her entire GCSE years undertaken amid a worldwide health crisis. “Even she says she could do with another year at school,” she says. “Theyve missed a full year of preparation for the next step. Theyve been living alone in their bedroom. No formal, nothing. They werent even in school to plan it.” Its a quiet day in the barber shop, on what would normally be a busy Friday afternoon, with people popping in ahead of their weekend plans. There would have been excited chatter, the buzz of anticipation. Last minute changes of plan. Maybe even a wee drink. A look at her schedule confirms a gap of a few hours until Paulines next appointment. Without that steady flow of customers, the day can be long, lonely even. Welcome to Moneymore. Company is a two way street, and the dynamic of conversation, service and industry has been greatly missed by both barber and customer. “Even the most bald man that I have is in here every week,” says Pauline. “Two seconds would do it, but you would stretch it out to ten or  minutes, just because he likes coming in for the company. “Sometimes its just nice to get sitting down and get it done for you. Even though I have good faithful customers, I was nervous and jittery the first day back. “The amount of people who are saying its great to see you back, it gives you that wee glow. It would be nice to see a boom in Moneymore again. “I dont think anybody is going to feel anything dferent. Were all just going with the flow and trying not to stress and worry. “I think youre just going to have to wipe this year out the same as last year.”  The indicators that marked the early, panic-stricken days of the pandemic – the empty streets, closed schools, empty supermarket shelves – have long faded into memory. Only the window dressing remains. Sanitisers at shop doors. Face masks in shops. The odd discarded rubber glove on the street. All three car dealerships on the Magherafelt Road are dotted with customers as I drive past on the way home. The petrol station forecourt is hiving with people. By next Monday, theof indoor hospitality will mark another signicant step on the road to recovery. On the way out of the town, I spot a familiar cowboy hat bobbing up and down at the road side. A man enjoying his rediscovered freedom on the fringes of the Sperrins.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

That was the last we heard from him.ldquoI was listening to the news all afternoon to hearthere was anything happening. It wasnrsquot until pm that night when I was listening to the RTE news that I heard a priest had been shot in Ballymurphy.Mr Mullan knew in his gut that it was his brother, but could not bring himself to tell his parents, John and Mary.ldquoAll that was said that he was shot, it didnrsquot say he was dead.

He particularly liked to help young people and loved working and encouraging them.ldquoIf he had have got a chance in Ballymurphy, he would have helped the people no end to help themselves.

This means that plastic litter in the sea is just adding up and, globally, we are adding a truck load full every minute, she continued.ldquoThat is a lot of plastic and, on top of looking bad, it is harmful to sea plants and animals. Every year, plastic kills , sea animals and over a million sea birds. It is a big problem.During last weekrsquos launch event in Ardglass, a number of fishermen told Jenny how sad they were to see how much litter is in the sea and that they have noticed an increase in the amount of it in during their letimes.ldquoIt also takes their valuable time at sea to clear from their nets and can potentially contaminate their catch, so the new scheme is a win-win for them to do their part in getting rid of it.Describing the new project as ldquoinnovative, Jenny said it has already been successful where with fishermen bringing marine litter caught in their nets back to shore.She said the Harbour Authority provides durable bags for the litter to be collected in and that once landed onshore, it is sent off to be recycled or otherwise disposed of.ldquoThis is how our fishermen in Northern Ireland are reducing the marine plastic problem at sea, Jenny explained. ldquoThe thing that makes this project so unique is that fishermen are almost the only people who have access to litter that is out in the open water or at the seabed.ldquoStopping waste entering the sea is imperative, but taking litter out of the sea is too, even though it is more challenging. That is exactly what lsquofishing for litterrsquo fishermen do.Jenny praised the fishermen in Ardglass who have signed up to the scheme as did local councillor, Dermot Curran.ldquoThis is a great scheme and anything which can help reduce the amount of marine litter being washed ashore is to be welcomed, he said.ldquoTen Ardglass skippers have already signed up for the scheme and I hope that there will be more. This is a great new initiative but we also have to look at how litter gets into the sea in the first place which poses problems for trawler skippers as this waste gets tangled up in their nest which is time-consuming and a distraction they could well do without, he said.ldquoThe Fishery Harbour Authority is to be congratulated for bringing this initiative to the Co Down ports and the more skippers that sign up for lsquofishing for litterrsquo the better. The scheme can help protect the environment and reduce the amount of unsightly litter being washed up along the shoreline..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Business.jpg","title":"Business support programme helps secure 78 jobs in district  ","story":"A COUNCIL-LED local business support programme has created  jobs in the last  months.According to new figures released, the Business Growth and Tender for Growth programmes facilitated by Newry, Mourne and Down District Council have helped to create an average of one new job each week.The programmes are part-funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern Irelandprogramme.Despite the impact of recent lockdowns over the last  months, NMD Business has continued to provide SMEs with support packages in response to challenges created by the pandemic.This has resulted in ongoing growth for the business and the creation of  new job roles, as well as helping  businesses involved in the programme to navigate an unprecedented economic environment.Participants in the programme are able to avail of one-to-one mentoring from leading experts, who help guide them and their business through unprecedented times, as well as learning new skills in financial management, cross-border sales and maximising your chances of winning tenders.As a result, many businesses have been able to not only grow their business, but grow their workforce.Sara Velasquez, from Ecoplastic in Downpatrick, completed the programme last year and has already recruited four new staff for the business.Her firm designs and makes all kinds of structures from % recycled material, from boardwalks to street furniture, bridges to bike trails and picnic tables.She said: ldquoThe NMD Business programme helped us focus on the most lucrative areas for growth for our business.ldquoOur dedicated mentor provided us with expert guidance which allowed us to respond quickly to a new market environment, giving us confidence that decisions we were taking were anchored in good commercial sense, while the workshops equipped us with new skills that will stand us in good stead into the future.ldquoSales have since increased as a result and we continue to work on exciting projects across Ireland and the UK.

It was a four-lap course which started at Greenisland Golf Club and carried on via Monkstown Wood, Shore Road and then a bit of a challenge with a hill to contend with on Station Road.The weather was grey with a little drizzle but nothing to cause major problems and in fact Declan felt that there was a slight wind assistance on the climb which was welcome.The overall winner Chris Denton, was the only runner to break three hours and he took top spot on the podium with a time of two hours and  minutes.Declan was more than happy with his own time of . and the fact that he placed seventh overall.

This is especially true of local access to emergency care.Mr Hazzard said many were acutely aware that the Department of Health will soon launch a review of urgent and emergency care, suggesting that given the soundings to date from both health minister Robin Swann and the South Eastern Trust, there will be concern across the community that this will have ldquomajor ramications for the delivery of emergency medicine in small rural hospitals like the Downe.ldquoWith this in mind, it is vital that our local community and health workers are afforded an opportunity to be proactively involved in determining the most appropriate model of healthcare at the Downe, the MP declared.ldquoI was encouraged to hear the health trust recognise that communication and dialogue need to improve in the time ahead and that elected representatives, trade unions and community health activists can play a constructive role in partnership with officials in delivering for the Downe.Mr Hazzard said this would not only enable the local community to benefit from regular public engagement and consultation but, perhaps most importantly, would ensure a real andmeaningful process of co-design with staff and their trade union representatives.He added: ldquoI look forward to hearing back from the South Eastern Trust in the weeks ahead as to how this partnership forum can be established and will once again endeavour to work in partnership with all local political parties, staff representatives, and the Down Community Health Committee.News of the proposal for the establishment of the new health forum involving the public and health workers comes after Newry, Mourne and Down Council agreed to involve local health campaigners in a a major new offensive to ensure that the Downpatrick hospital continues to deliver key services.In April, politicians paved the way for the Down Community Heath Committee to join them in key discussions about the future of the Downpatrick hospital which they say has a critical role to play in delivering key services for people across the South Eastern Trust area in a post-Covid world..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Hurlers.jpg","title":"Hurlers rally to win over Carlow  ","story":"DOWN hurlers showed they still have plenty to fight for after they secured a rallying comeback win inspired by their talisman Paul Sheehan against Carlow.Following last weekendrsquos defeat to Kerry, Ronan Sheehanrsquos men knew they had to put on a show at Ballycran in order to avoid an early indication of relegation.The contest was worthy of a crowd, as the action-packed affair exploded from the first whistle when Carlowrsquos Kevin McDonald put his side a goal up within the opening minute.The away side piled on relentless pressure to inflict further damage on the Down side as the points gap began to widen.However, as per the usual story, star man Sheehan began picking up the pieces and alongside Caolan Taggart and Daithi Sands, Down began to let Carlow know they werenrsquot here to just fill up the numbers.The away team lost their goal advantage on the half-hour mark when the ever dangerous Conor Woods cracked home a thumping penalty to tie the scores.Sheehan ensured Down entered the half-time break on top, scoring three points in two minutes to help his side lead -

There will also be increased emphasis on ensuring that public toilets meet the needs of those with autism, dementia and other health conditions.The new toilet strategy mdash which includes a review of how council-owned toilets are managed, cleaned and maintained mdash is expected to be formally signed off at tonightrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Across the district, the local authority is responsible for  public conveniences, many of which have been in place for over  years and are showing signs of corrosion and internal wear and tear. A number have also been vandalised.Councillors will be told tonight that a decision is required to repair, replace or remove these particular units and they will be provided with a detailed breakdown of the work that is required.Toilets at Castlewellanrsquos Upper Square need to be replaced while the outer shell of the building would remain in place, while the existing facility at Market Street in Downpatrick would be entirely replaced.The new strategy suggests that the current public toilets at The Rocks in Ballyhornan would be replaced as would existing toilets at the local authority-owned car park at the Newcastle Road outside Dundrum.Plans have also been drawn up to replace toilets at Crossgarrsquos Lislea Drive and at Ardglass harbour, while public toilets at the New Line in Saintfield mdash which have been repeatedly targeted by vandals mdash would replaced, alongside those at the Quoile Road in Downpatrick.Public toilets the Lough Inch cemetery in Ballynahinch and Struell Cemetery in Downpatrick are also in line for refurbishment under the new council strategy, alongside conveniences at Windmill Street in Ballynahinch.It will also be confirmed at tonightrsquos council meeting that almost  people responded to a -week consultation on the new strategy with over  percent of those who responded agreeing with the suggestion to pay to spend a penny. Concern was also expressed about the cleanliness of some public toilets and their layout.And while council toilets in Newcastle, Dundrum, Castlewellan, Downpatrick, Ballyhornan and Ardglass have reopened after being closed due to coronavirus, those in Saintfield, Ballynahinch, Crossgar and Killyleagh remain closed.

It is celebrated on Sunday, May .In their joint message, the bishops opened by quoting a verse from the book of Acts in the Bible: \"All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability - Acts :.\"They continued: \"One of the great marks of the first Pentecost was the ability the Holy Spirit gave the apostles to speak across barriers of language of the works of God.ldquoThe Spirit today gives the people of God the same ability to speak as one across all kinds of barriers and boundaries.ldquoWe rejoice today that we can speak together to both our church communities and beyond with a common message of hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\"Stating their disappointment that for a second year they are unable to mark this \"great feast\" by coming together for their Ecumenical Service of Prayer, as they have done for almost  years, the bishops added: \"This service allows us to give thanks and praise together to God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Please God, next year this might again be possible.\"They continued their message by noting how speaking together about \"the goodness of God\" across barriers is an \"important expression of the language of hope\".They said: \"This is so important as we begin the journey of recovery from the impact of coronavirus. There has been much suffering the loss of loved ones, illness, financial challenge and isolation.ldquoWe all need to hear the healing and strengthening words of Christ, lsquoCome unto me all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you restrsquo.\"Outlining how during the pandemic people quickly realised how important communication is when denied simple non-verbal qualities of close contact and touch, the bishops said: \"We discovered how much we need the warmth of the love of our family and friends.ldquoThe telephone and internet became our key means of keeping in touch and we thank God for these technological aids that kept us connected.ldquoCrucially, we learned how much we are indebted to medical staff, nurses, key workers and volunteers who have communicated dedication, care and love to the community through their skill and acts of kindness.\"We must continue to communicate the language of love and hope across all barriers and boundaries.ldquoIt would be so easy after this long period of restrictions to move to despair and lose hope. Yet we believe there are signs of new le all around us in the vaccination programme and the good response to public health guidance.ldquoLet us encourage one another to communicate the hope that by Godrsquos help, our common le will slowly , and together seek his grace to renew our lives.\"In closing, the bishops said: \"We pray that the Holy Spirit of Pentecost may inspire us so that we communicate in our words and deeds the hope we have in God.ldquoMay we as Christian people speak of our belief in the transforming power of God, and by his Spirit to work together for the rebuilding and re-energising of our churches and society.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Access should only be restrictedany confidential information is discussed. If any person considers that access to meetings is being restricted unnecessarily, their first step should be to approach the council with these concerns.But access remained denied, so the Minister was asked to amend legislation around this sticking point.A spokesperson replied: ldquoGiven legislation currently allows public press access to committees and subcommittees subject to the exclusions previously advised, the Department is not at this time considering making amendments.This was shared with councillors, with all who replied commenting positively around press attendance.Councillor Barry McElduff, Sinn Fein formally called for press to be permitted access to Health Group meetings and Chief Executive Alison McCullagh suggested this could be achieved by upgrading to subcommittee status.Following unanimous agreement in December, BBC Local Democracy enquired when this could be expected, and were advised it was part of an ongoing review.The matter arose last week, and what started out as a victory for democracy, quickly dwindled when members learned upgrading meant quota rules of membership would apply.Councillor Emmet McAleer, Independent suggested retaining working group status, but opening meetings to public and press, but the Chair Councillor Stephen McCann replied: ldquoThat conversation has been had a number of times and we are aware why that cannot happen. However it was given extra clout as a subcommittee, I understand the press would have access. That would address some concerns members have raised in the past.The Chief Executive stressed: ldquoThe only dference is Standing Orders apply in subcommittees, therefore press and public would have normal access.Current Health Group member Councillor Donal OrsquoCofaigh, Independent, acknowledged subcommittee status would cost him his place under the quota, but nonetheless was willing to agreeit meant public and press access.SDLP Councillor Mary Garrity said: ldquoIf itrsquos not legislatively enforceable, we come upon this quandary, whether we like it or not.However she felt working group status meant reporting back to full council and: ldquoAbsent the press, we would still get all our concerns highlighted.The Chief Executive confirmed: ldquoActions would be reported, irrespective of working group or subcommittee status.Councillor Josephine Deehan, Independent found it: ldquoRegrettable we didnrsquot have information regarding legislative requirements prior to making this decision. Irsquom concerned that members of small parties and independents would be excluded. I strongly believe in inclusion and as elected members we have a duty to represent our constituents.She added: ldquoTherersquos not a huge amount of dference between a subcommittee and a working group. In terms of involving the press and public, we would have the opportunity to raise issues at standing committees.Proposing retention of the current working group status to ensure inclusivity and current membership, Councillor Deehan said: ldquoThe only dference is access to the public and press hellipRepresentation and input from members is more important and should be the greater priority.This was seconded by Councillor Garrity.Councillor McElduff requested clarity around press access noting: ldquoObviously where possible, when we arenrsquot talking about issues which are confidential, wersquod want to err on the side of openness and transparency.The Chief Executive pointed to legislation in which: ldquoThere is no provision for press or public to attend working group meetings.Councillor Adam Gannon, SDLP noted the Health Group was: ldquoLooked at to change into a subcommittee because some members wanted it opened to the press. Whilst it would be nice to have public access to everything, it may not always happen and canrsquot always be that way.Concluding the discussion, he said whatever the status of the group: ldquoThe work is still being done. It would be nice for the public to be present, but we donrsquot need the press there to do our work. I know I donrsquot.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I haven’t had the opportunity to speak with Edwin yet but I’m sure, when I do, we’ll discuss all of those matters,” she said.“He hasn’t been speaking to me as yet and actually I still have yet to see the letter, so-called, and I’m beginning to wonder is there a letter at all, but in any event I look forward to seeing the letter and I look forward to having that conversation whenever Edwin reaches out.Mrs Foster said the letter “was supposed to be signed by  of my colleagues”.“Some of my colleagues are indicating they were told they were number , even though a number of them had been told that, so I would quite like to see the letter just from my own point of view to see what’s in it, and to see what was told to my colleagues,” she said.“It’s now been nearly four weeks since I heard about it and I still haven’t seen it.”Frontbench DUP MLA and Stormont Economy Minister Diane Dodds earlier said she hoped the party could heal itself following the leadership election.Mr Poots has said he plans to hold one-on-one meetings with MLAs and will later announce his ministerial team – including who will be first minister, having ruled himself out, saying he would prefer to concentrate on leading the DUP.Asked whether she had had her meeting with Mr Poots, Mrs Dodds said she had spoken to him.“I obviously have spoken to Edwin, that is critical for the way forward for the party,” she told media as she visited the Grand Central Hotel in Belfast.“I hope that the party can heal itself and to move forward, because the most important thing that the party can do from now on is to ensure that we attract the greatest and widest proportion of those people who are pro-union voters, those people who are concerned about the economy and who know that we have the policies, and the drive and the energy to make Northern Ireland a great place to live, to work and to do business.”Earlier, Mrs Dodds told the BBC there was a “huge job of work to do” for Mr Poots.Asked whether she felt he was the person to do the job, she responded: “The party takes a democratic decision and therefore that is the decision, and that is the position that we have arrived at.“I have made it very clear that the way forward for the party, and indeed the way forward for unionism in general, is to be as inclusive as it can possibly be to ensure that we are attracting pro-union voters to the cause of the DUP but generally to the cause of the union, and we will do that by being inclusive and being open-minded on the values and the importance of the union to Northern Ireland.”Asked whether she thought she would still be Stormont Economy Minister next Thursday, Mrs Dodds said: “I am not going to allow any of that to spoil my breakfast this morning in such a wonderful setting as the Grand Central Hotel, as for now, I am continuing to do my job as the Economy Minister.”  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have broadened our option subjects at KS - we are now able to offer Construction, Health and Social Care and Textiles and Fashion.ldquoWe are committed to the promotion of SRG as a learning organisation. To this end we have entered into an ITE Partnership with Cardf politan University and an alliance with St.Illtydrsquos Catholic Comprehensive in Cardf. It is mutually beneficial since we help develop new teachers into the profession and we are able to utilise educational research to improve standards across both key stages.The Catholic school strives to ensures pupils succeed, while also being good people.ldquoWe aim for our pupils to live by the ethos of our pupil profile which is about virtues to empower them to be a success in le, added Mr Blackwell.ldquoWe are the faith secondary school of the Vale and so provide an excellent secondary education that runs equally alongside our holistic development of our pupils as iniduals and good all round people.The Catholic ethos is embedded into daily le at the school, with morning prayer, virtues-based assemblies, and daily reflection.ldquoAll staff engage in role modelling behaviour that reflects the Catholic virtues of honesty, integrity and forgiveness, added Mr Blackwell.ldquoDuring normal school times Mass is a frequent part of our school le ndash not all pupils come to us with a faith background, but they all appreciate the values that we try to weave into our everyday lives.Along with the schoolrsquos ethical focus St Richard Gwyn Catholic High School has an abundance of extra-curricular activities on offer, including school trips.Sporty youngsters can take part in football, rugby, netball, hockey, tennis, badminton, athletics, cheerleading and street dance. Therersquos also Clwb Cymraeg and an array of creative activities on offer ndash including art club, textiles club, choir, SRG band.Bi-annually the music, drama, and art departments join forces to produce and perform an arts production.St Richard Gwyn Catholic High School strives to form lsquopositive relationshipsrsquo with families and the local community and has a Facebook group regularly updated with video messages from Mr Blackwell and key messages for families.Each year group has a Progress Leader who is a point of contact for families as well as our Wellbeing and Progress Centre who liaises with families on a regular basis. Plus, St Richard Gwyn Catholic High School is in the process of obtaining the Investors in Families , which ndash in a nutshell ndash lsquois a quality mark that recognises the work that schools and other settings undertake with families to improve outcomes for children and young people.rsquoThe school is also lsquoproudrsquo to have worked with numerous charities ndash including fundraising for local food banks and helping Keep Wales Tidy with beach cleans.The school has also adapted a lsquogreatrsquo deal during the coronavirus pandemic ndash with the immediate priority being health and safety such as year group lsquobubblesrsquo, separate lunches, allocated outdoor spaces, regular sanitizing and face coverings.ldquoThe biggest impact, in terms of day to day operation, meant teachers moved more between lessons than students, said Mr Blackwell.ldquoCrucial to adapting to the pandemic was to adoption of online learning. There have been periods of lockdown with no pupils in school as well as fortnightly periods that have required year groups to isolate.He praised the training and use of online s as lsquotransformativersquo. and added that - while itrsquos lsquofantasticrsquo to resume in-person learning these changes and developments will continue to improve how the school operates.The school is lsquovery fortunatersquo to have been supported by the local authority to make the best of the buildings they have, but the school is awaiting progress on a new build under the st Century schools programme, financed by Welsh Government.ldquoWe firmly believe that what goes on inside school is more important than the way the building looks externally, said Mr Blackwell.ldquoWe have amazing staff who work exceptionally hard to make the best of the facilities we have, all pupils who come to us get a great educational experience.ldquoHowever, we are still awaiting progress on a new build. We will continue to work hard to improve our facilities with the support of our Governors and the local authority, but at the same time we will continue to lobby to get the new build progressed as soon as possible so that our pupils not only get a fantastic experience, but they also get it in state-of-the-art facilities they deserve. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
