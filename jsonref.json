That was the case through high school, and I think I was always aware that while for the most part I was attracted to women, I existed on a spectrum.\u0027He then confessed that he had struggled to accept that, believing he had to be definitively a heterosexual or homosexual.\u0027I felt ashamed that I wasn’t 100 percent, because it was clear that one side of sexuality presents issues, and the other doesn’t as much,\u0027 he explained.

That was the case through high school,\u0027 he explained (Hedges and Frances McDormand in Billboards)That ambiguity may be part of the reason he is such an impressive actor explained Hedges, who suggested it was easier for him to make decisions in character as opposed to real life.  \u0027I’m very much within the conflict and confusion of my own life still, and I definitely feel a pressure to step up in a way,\u0027 said Hedges. \u0027I prefer to step up in my art, and I don’t entirely know how to in my life.\u0027That seems to be the case in Erased, with The Hollywood Reporter noting in its review that Hedges \u0027carries the entire show and is alternately frightened, bewildered and defiant. There isn’t a false note in his performance.\u0027That praise is even more impressive given his co-stars are Oscar-winning actors Russell Crowe and Nicole Kidman. Hedges is also set to appear on Broadway next month in Kenneth Lonergan\u0027s critically-lauded play The Waverly Gallery as well, marking the second time he has worked with his Manchester director. That play will pair Hedges - who has worked with the likes of Michelle Williams, Frances McDormand, Julia Roberts and Kidman - with one of the most iconic women in the history of the industry, Elaine May. User Data and Cookie Consent"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/01/21/4F9D23B800000578-0-image-m-28_1535835212006.jpg","title":"Jamie Oliver lives frightening moment tackled burglar","story":"    Jamie Oliver (pictured last week) chased a burglar down the street before tackling him to the ground after catching the would-be thief trying to break into his mansionJamie Oliver today described his fear as chased an \u0027aggressive\u0027 man he feared was trying to break into his £8.9million mansion.The TV chef and restaurateur, 43, \u0027went absolutely mad\u0027 and pinned the burglar to the ground while neighbours in north London called 999 on Tuesday night. The man was said to be \u0027f***** off his face on meth\u0027 and \u0027dancing around topless\u0027 before targeting  the chef\u0027s grand home in Highgate, where Kate Moss and Jude Law are neighbours.Jamie, who held down the man until the police arrived said last night: \u0027I didn\u0027t have a choice so it wasn\u0027t really about bravery. I wouldn\u0027t recommend it.\u0027I had a tiny window to stop something getting much much worse.\u0027It was a very horrible, unfortunate and frightening scenario.\u0027Police yesterday  revealed the man Jamie believed was a burglar is back on the streets.A witness, who works at the  Flask, a pub across the street, said the suspect had been \u0027dancing around topless\u0027 in the beer garden before heading to the chef\u0027s mansion.The great burglary cop-out: Norfolk Police leave it to a...Share this articleHis first port of call was George Michael\u0027s grand home, which until recently had a shrine outside more than 18 months after his death.The witness, who did not wish to be named, said: \u0027He was f***** out of his head. He went into the beer garden, took his top off and started dancing. There was no music.\u0027The man, described as white, chubby and around 26, left after the pub\u0027\u0027s manager told him to go.\u0027He started staring in the gates at George Michael\u0027s house. It was weird. He sounds like a George Michael fanatic\u0027, the witness said.\u0027Then he was outside Jamie Oliver\u0027s house looking through the gates. Next thing we see this blonde guy chasing the guy down the street, it was Jamie Oliver.\u0027It was crazy.  He sprinted down the street with three guys, who looked like security guards, pinned him to the ground in the car park with his arm behind his back.\u0027The guy didn\u0027t react much, still looked very dazed. Jamie\u0027s got lots of kids to worry about so fair enough\u0027.      One neighbour on the father-of-five\u0027s street in Highgate (pictured), north London, said: \u0027It was just a brave, selfless thing to do\u0027The criminal, who had apparently tried to break into several other lavish homes on the same street in North London, was arrested by police. A Met Police spokesman said: \u0027At 7.15pm on Tuesday, September 4, police were called to reports of an aggressive male attempting to gain entry to residential addresses.\u0027The male was apprehended by members of the public and was subsequently detained by police. He was taken to a north London police station and was subsequently released with no further action.\u0027When asked why the suspect would be released the spokesman would not comment on Jamie Oliver\u0027s specific case, but said: \u0027It could be for any number of reasons such as lack of evidence or he could have had mental health problems.\u0027  It came as it was revealed the police \u0027screened out\u0027 more than 34,000 crimes last year on the day they were reported, compared to just over 13,000 the year before. The raider tried to break into Jamie\u0027s £8.9million, eight-bedroom mansion and other homes along the exclusive street. Other stars believed to live on the road include Kate Moss and Jude Law, although the actor told MailOnline today he didn\u0027t know about Jamie\u0027s heroics.His wife Jools, 43, and their five children, Poppy, 16, Daisy, 15, Petal, nine, Buddy, 7, River, two, were all in the house at the time.Mrs Oliver said this morning: \u0027I don\u0027t really want to comment any further. I believe it\u0027s all been said in the papers already\u0027. Neighbours today called the star chef a \u0027hero\u0027 and one said: \u0027It was just a brave, selfless thing to do.\u0027Despite the clearly very hairy situation, Jamie was laughing and joking with the coppers saying they\u0027d done a great job to arrive so quickly after the 999 call. Everyone is really thankful for his quick thinking and courage.\u0027           Jamie was at home with his wife Jools (pictured) and five children - Poppy, 16, Daisy, 15, Petal, nine, Buddy, seven, and two-year-old River - at the time of the break-in on Tuesday eveningAnother source told the Daily Mirror last night: \u0027It was understandably very scary as Jamie was with the whole family in his house at the time. It was an instinctive reaction – he was just trying to do the right thing. \u0027Jamie was alerted to something wrong when he heard a massive commotion coming from his neighbour\u0027s house.\u0027He was set to investigate but before he knew it, he was face to face with the burglar himself as he tried to smash his way into his house as well.\u0027Jamie went absolutely mad and sprinted after the man down the street before catching up with him and pinning him down to the floor. \u0027He was then joined by his driver and a handful of neighbours who helped him hold down the burglar until police arrived to arrest him\u0027. Last month Jamie Oliver revealed he ploughed £12.7million of his own money into his struggling restaurant business after being given two hours to save the chain.Earlier this year, Jamie announced he was closing 12 of his 37 Jamie\u0027s Italian restaurants with 200 jobs affected. Speaking about the crisis, Jamie told the Financial Times Magazine: \u0027I had two hours to put money in and save it or the whole thing would go to s*** that day or the next day... It was as bad as that and as dramatic as that.\u0027Jamie told the financial newspaper that his firm \u0027simply run out of cash\u0027 and raged at \u0027people supposed to manage that stuff\u0027.Jamie Oliver hailed a hero after tackling “aggressive” burglar trying to break into his home - Mirror Online"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/08/50055FBD00000578-6154205-image-m-25_1536652091649.jpg","title":"Ben Elton takes aim Sir Mark Rylance new comedy series","story":"Ben Elton\u0027s comedy Upstart Crow has taken aim at Sir Mark Rylance, right, over their row on whether Shakespeare really wrote his plays.

The series, featuring David Mitchell as Shakespeare, pictured, mocks Rylance for \u0027playing intelligent\u0027 and \u0027championing exotic theories to appear clever\u0027He invited Elton to answer questions he and Sir Derek raised and added \u0027orthodox scholars\u0027 disagree on how much of his works Shakespeare was actually responsible for.Sir Mark told the Times: \u0027The Stratfordian response to our question about the authorship has usually been to lampoon the questioner, if not worse. I guess it\u0027s because they can\u0027t answer the question or make it go away, so they try to make us go away.\u0027 Sir Derek has claimed the dramas were written by Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, who hid behind William Shakespeare because, he said, a nobleman could not be seen as a common playwright.Sir Mark has previously pointed out that details about Italy in the plays are \u0027exact\u0027 and the Earl had widely toured the country.He added the \u0027big thing\u0027 in the Earl\u0027s favour was his wide knowledge of Italy where 14 of of Bard\u0027s plays are set. But Elton has said he \u0027loathes conspiracy theories\u0027 around Shakespeare and added there was a \u0027massive amount of proof\u0027 suggesting he was the true author.He also compared the row over Shakespeare\u0027s authorship to rejecting climate change and said \u0027fact denial\u0027 was a \u0027threat to society\u0027.The episode airs on BBC2 tomorrow at 8.30pm. Mark Rylance ridiculed by upstarts over comedy of errors | News | The Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/09/5005CC4400000578-6154285-image-a-9_1536654538862.jpg","title":"Raheem Sterling fools ball pit family day out","story":"    The Manchester City player appears in the video alongside his fiancée Paige Milian and children Melody and Thiago          Raheem is filmed by Paige, 23, with Thiago scaling a climbing wall – and then tumbling to the padded floorThey are then seen attempting to enter the Sea Life centre at Manchester\u0027s Trafford Centre before erting to a Lego store because the queue was too long.The two children are shown excitedly choosing toys in the store before the action cuts to the Infla Nation indoor play centre.Celebrity Big Brother: Ryan Thomas is crowned WINNER as he...Top art dealer Oliver Hoare who was Diana¿s lover and...Share this articleRaheem – struggling to keep his tracksuit bottoms above his waist – is filmed by Paige, 23, burying giggling Thiago in a sea of purple balls, zooming down a slide with the tot before scaling a climbing wall – and then tumbling to the padded floor.He was also filmed swimming across the sea balls in the ball pool before the family is captured back in the car for the journey home.

It is also the surname both princes used during their time in the military. However, upon marriage to Kate Middleton, Prince William became the Duke of Cambridge meaning that his three children will likely follow the tradition of using the father’s title as the surname. This means that should the Duke and Duchess follow the Royal Family tradition, their children will use their father’s title, Sussex as the surname.In the same way, Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice use the surname York, after their father’s title Prince Andrew, the Duke of York.Since 1960, the Queen’s children and her descendants would also be allowed to use the surname of Mountbatten-Windsor. However, the Royal Family website confirms: ‘For the most part, members of the Royal Family who are entitled to the style and dignity of HRH Prince or Princess do not need a surname, but if at any time any of them do need a surname (such as upon marriage), that surname is Mountbatten-Windsor.’Kimi Räikkönen net worth revealed as F1 and Ferrari star confirms he\u0027s joining Sauber in 2019Big Brother 2018: All you need to know Who is Dr DisRespect?

The MAC was asked by the Government to carry out analysis of the impact of international students on the UK\u0027s education system, economy and societyWhile the lowest quarter of British masters graduates had average earnings of £20,500, the figure for those from outside the EU was just £15,400. The MAC said many responses to a call for evidence wanted a more generous post-study work regime.Currently, PhD visas allow students to remain in the UK for four months after expected course completion, although to an extension scheme that permits a year of work.Masters students also have up to four months, except those in a pilot programme allowing six months.The MAC recommended that PhD students automatically get one year\u0027s leave to remain after finishing their courses.It proposed an extension to six months for all Masters students, but called for a \u0027more thorough\u0027 review of whether this is appropriate.In a finding the Committee acknowledged would disappoint the higher education sector, it did not recommend a separate post-study work visa scheme.On the Government\u0027s net migration target, which has never been met, the report said removing students \u0027would be difficult technically and, if done correctly, would make almost no difference to the net migration figures\u0027.However, it suggested there may be an \u0027image problem\u0027 fuelled by \u0027repeated discussions\u0027 of students in the net migration target.\u0027If there is a problem with students in the net migration target, it is with the target itself rather than the inclusion of students in that target,\u0027 Prof Manning said.\u0027Summarising migration policy through the net migration target may give the impression that the government seeks to reduce the net migration of all types of migrants including students.\u0027 The report pointed out that other countries did not calculate equivalent net migration figures that were used to set targets.It added: \u0027The net migration target is a political target and the IPS net migration figure does not have to form the basis of the government\u0027s net migration target.           The report was commissioned last year by then-Home Secretary Amber Rudd (pictured), who was leading the campaign in Cabinet to persuade Mrs May to back down\u0027The government could choose to use other data sources to set targets related to migration, such as visa or settlement statistics. Or it could choose not to have a target at all and summarise its ambitions on net migration in a different way.\u0027The Committee also concluded international student numbers should remain uncapped.Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of campaign group Migration Watch UK, welcomed the \u0027excellent\u0027 report.He said: \u0027The MAC endorsement of the inclusion of students in the migration statistics should put this issue to bed. It is also right that the post-study work regime should remain carefully policed.\u0027A Home Office spokesman said: \u0027As this report makes clear, international students play an important and positive role in our education system, economy and society.\u0027We are committed to ensuring we continue to attract the best international students.\u0027Professor Dame Janet Beer, president of Universities UK, said: \u0027While the report recognises the enormous contribution international students make to life in the UK, we are disappointed with its main recommendations.\u0027We agree that the Government and the sector should continue to work together to grow the number of international students, but growth will only be possible if we have an immigration system that encourages talented international students to choose the UK.\u0027    "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/16/4FDC941A00000578-6155781-image-a-2_1536679079862.jpg","title":"Who Daniel Zhang Alibaba CEO replacement revealed Jack Ma reveals stepping down","story":"    Zhang will succeed Jack Ma as executive chairman of the Alibaba Group in September 2019Who is Daniel Zhang?Daniel Zhang is a businessman slated to take over as executive chairman of Alibaba, succeeding Jack Ma.He was born in Shanghai, China on January 11, 1972.After studying finance at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Zhang served as the chief executive officer of the Chinese video game company Shanda Interactive Entertainment and also as a high-level manager at PricewaterhouseCoopers’s Shanghai office.Zhang joined Alibaba subsidiary Taobao in 2007 as its chief financial officer.

Jaguar Land Rover may be forced to stop building cars in Britain if Theresa May fails to strike the ‘right’ Brexit deal, the company’s boss warned yesterday.In a hard-hitting speech addressed directly to the Prime Minister, Ralf Speth (pictured, right) claimed tens of thousands of jobs could be lost across the car industry.Earlier this summer the car giant outlined plans to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in upgrading its plants in Solihull in the West Midlands and Halewood in Merseyside to build to the next versions of hybrid and electric Range Rover models.Dr Speth said ‘unfettered access’ to the EU’s single market was as crucial to its business as ‘wheels are to our cars’.Without it, he said production in Britain could grind to a halt, putting many of JLR’s 44,000 employees at risk.Speaking at the Government’s Zero Emission Vehicle summit in Birmingham as Mrs May prepared to take the stage, Dr Speth said: ‘Brexit is due to happen on the 29th of March next year. Currently, I do not even know if any of our manufacturing facilities in the UK will be able to function on the 30th.‘Like many British companies our supply chains reach deep into Europe. Bluntly, we will not be able to build cars, if the motorway to and from Dover becomes a car park, where the vehicle carrying parts – vital to our processes – is stationary.’JLR is already in the process of opening a new £1billion plant in Nitra, Slovakia, where its new Land Rover Discovery is being built. The decision to shift production from Birmingham – putting hundreds of jobs at risk – was announced in June.But Mr Speth hinted that this could be just the start, warning that it is already ‘thousands of pounds cheaper to produce vehicles in Slovakia than Solihull’ due to higher costs and the UK’s ‘poor productivity rates’.The Prime Minister’s spokesman said her Chequers Brexit plan included proposals to protect jobs in areas that rely on ‘just-in-time’ supply chains.He insisted it would ‘help ensure frictionless trade with the EU and would see our car sector to continue to flourish’."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/22/500B16C600000578-0-image-a-37_1536701252559.jpg","title":"The REAL Lady Overly familiar presidents blundering officials","story":"    Gerald Ford dancing with Queen Elizabeth II at the ball at the White House, Washington, during the 1976 Bicentennial Celebrations of the Declaration of IndependenceFor her very first trip to Florida — part of her 1991 state visit to America — the Royal Yacht had sailed in to Miami to rendezvous with the Queen.As Britannia\u0027s crew waited to greet her, they flushed through all the royal baths and heads (ship\u0027s lavatories), which was standard practice ahead of a royal arrival. Whereupon Britannia\u0027s captain suddenly had a furious official from the Miami port authority thumping on his door.The crew had just breached strict environmental regulations and the captain was handed a $10,000 (£7,700) fine plus an order to leave port within two hours.No matter that the Queen was due to host a state banquet on board that very evening, with two former U.S. presidents among the guests. Rules were rules. The Yacht would have to pack up and go.It was only after the direct intervention of the White House that Britannia was allowed to remain alongside. The banquet duly took place without further incident. The fabled \u0027special relationship\u0027 had worked its magic once again.It\u0027s a phrase, however, which is heard more often on this side of the Atlantic and there are commentators in both Britain and the U.S. who regard any notion of a \u0027special relationship\u0027 as sentimental, subservient wishful thinking on the part of the British Establishment.There have certainly been some strong inidual pairings between No 10 and the White House, notably Churchill and Roosevelt, Thatcher and Reagan and, latterly, Blair and George W. Bush.          Queen Elizabeth II rides on horseback with American President Ronald Reagan in Windsor, June 1982However, historians will note that there has been a more subtle, yet more consistent, \u0027special relationship\u0027 operating between the White House and Buckingham Palace throughout the reign of Elizabeth II — even during periods of deep political ision.Unlike the Queen\u0027s dealings with most countries, which have followed a well-established pattern, this is a friendship that has broken the bilateral mould. There can be few people in the U.S., let alone the rest of the world, who have lived through the administrations of 16 presidents — more than one-third of the total — and met 12 of them.Of the handful of private foreign holidays that the Queen has enjoyed in her life (all horse-related), five have been spent in the U.S.And in 2018, the Royal Family welcomed their first American Princess. Yet the Queen\u0027s own \u0027special relationship\u0027 goes back to the nursery.It was in 1939 that her parents travelled to Canada and the U.S. to bolster support for Britain ahead of impending hostilities in Europe. The royals rather enjoyed all the informality.The Queen wrote an excited letter to her daughters about a memorable picnic lunch: \u0027All our food on one plate — a little salmon, some turkey, some ham, lettuce, beans \u0026amp HOT DOGS too!\u0027While some Americans were appalled at the idea of serving hot dogs to a king, the Royal Family would never forget it.Growing up in wartime Windsor, Princess Elizabeth was acutely aware of the strain on her father as he tried to buoy the morale of a nation facing invasion at any moment, and she could sense the redemptive significance of America\u0027s entry into the war.          Queen Elizabeth signs on behalf of her dominion of Canada during the conclusion of the Power Project Ceremonies at the New York state end of the St. Lawrence Power DamCome victory and the drab, near-bankrupt years of austerity that followed, it was America that represented fun and glamour.Like so many others, the Princesses were entranced by the explosive arrival of the first American musical after the war, Oklahoma!Princess Margaret reportedly went to see it more than 30 times. Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip watched it together as a courting couple in 1947 People Will Say We\u0027re in Love has been one of \u0027their\u0027 songs ever since.The Queen\u0027s first experience of the U.S. was in 1951, when as Princess Elizabeth she interrupted a tour of Canada to meet President Harry Truman at the White House. Her first visit as Queen came in 1957 when she met President Dwight D. Eisenhower as well as the then-Vice-President Richard Nixon.Alongside formalities to mark the 350th anniversary of the first English colony at Jamestown, Virginia, the Queen and the Duke paid their first visit to a supermarket.           Pictured: The Queen of the World by Robert Hardman \u0027How nice you can bring your children along,\u0027 she told shoppers as she marvelled at the sight of a frozen-food section.Food was also on the agenda in 1959 when the Queen first entertained a U.S. president at home. Spending two days with the monarch at Balmoral, President Eisenhower found the experience so agreeable that he asked the Queen for \u0027her\u0027 scone recipe (though not her own, she duly transcribed it in her own hand).Disagreements after the Suez Crisis and then over Vietnam would strain the \u0027special relationship\u0027 on the political front, but not the rapport between the Windsors and the White House.In 1976, Gerald Ford invited the Queen across the Atlantic for a tumultuous state visit to honour the bicentenary of American independence. She was accompanied by her new Foreign Secretary, Anthony Crosland, and his American-born wife, who later recorded the Queen\u0027s advice on how to get through arduous tours like these.\u0027One plants one\u0027s feet like this,\u0027 the Queen told her. \u0027Always keep them parallel. Make sure your weight is evenly distributed. That\u0027s all there is to it.\u0027The advice would be invaluable, with a punishing itinerary in 100f (38c) heat. The centrepiece was a White House state banquet for more than 200 guests, including Hollywood stars Cary Grant, Telly Savalas and Merle Oberon.There was some amusement when the after-dinner cabaret, pop duo Captain \u0026amp Tennille, launched into their moderately risque hit Muskrat Love. That turned to considerable unamusement when President Ford invited the Queen to dance. The band chose that very moment to strike up a new tune: The Lady Is A Tramp.There was an even more awkward moment when Ford\u0027s successor arrived at Buckingham Palace a year later. Perhaps overcome with nerves on what was his first journey outside the U.S., Jimmy Carter became a little over-familiar with a senior member of the Royal Family.As William Shawcross notes in her official biography, the Queen Mother hated being told that she reminded people of their own mothers. Having informed her that she did, indeed, remind him of his own mother — \u0027Miz Lillian\u0027 — President Carter kissed the Queen Mother on the lips. As she later remarked, no one had done that since the death of George VI. \u0027I took a sharp step backwards,\u0027 she recalled, \u0027not far enough.\u0027Carter\u0027s successor, however, would enjoy one of the more enduring friendships between the Queen and any foreign politician. It certainly helped that Ronald Reagan was an accomplished horseman. When he came to Windsor Castle for a semi-private stay in 1982, the two heads of state spent a good hour riding all over Windsor Great Park followed by teams of bodyguards — on both four legs and four wheels.On a return trip to the U.S. in 1983, the Queen fulfilled a lifetime\u0027s ambition of touring the West Coast. In Hollywood, Reagan laid on a star-packed lunch for 500. The entertainment included Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope and Perry Como, but the arrangements left some of the local talent rather peeved.\u0027Ronald Reagan was asked who should be at the top table,\u0027 recalls Sir Brian Fall, then private secretary to the British Foreign Secretary, Francis Pym. \u0027Should it be actor friends or political friends? He couldn\u0027t sort it out so he said: \u0027Why don\u0027t we pack it out with Brits in Hollywood?\u0027 \u0027The result was a top table full of British-born stars such as Julie Andrews and Dudley Moore. For some status-obsessed Hollywood egos, it was all too much. The Palace press office, which had played no part in the planning, was left fending off accusations that the Queen was only interested in sitting with fellow Brits.          Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh this afternoon arrived in Washington D.C. where they were greeted by President Eisenhower\u0027I was on the table next door with Julie Andrews\u0027s husband,\u0027 Sir Brian recalls. \u0027He was so ticked off at not being on the right table that he walked off and left a gap.\u0027A few days later the Queen was due to arrive in San Francisco on Britannia, but foul weather persuaded her to fly instead. The Reagans put Air Force Two at her disposal and staff recall a very excited Queen pressing her face against a plane window to enjoy an aerial view of the Golden Gate Bridge.With no Royal Yacht to stay on, the combined power of the White House, the Palace and the personal contacts of the former state governor found the Queen and the Duke last-minute accommodation in the Presidential Suite at the St Francis Hotel, where Nancy Reagan even arranged for works of art from local museums to be rounded up and hung on the walls.\u0027The next question was: where to go for dinner?\u0027 remembers Sir Brian. Again the White House came to the rescue and managed to empty San Francisco\u0027s most famous restaurant, Trader Vic\u0027s, for the night. For the Queen, who had not eaten in a restaurant for 15 years, it was a novel experience, right down to being given a fortune cookie at the end (she read the message and then put it in her handbag).The \u0027special relationship\u0027 was still in robust shape following the first Gulf War as the Queen and Prince Philip arrived to stay with President George H. W. Bush in 1991.However, the state visit got off to an inauspicious start following President Bush\u0027s formal welcome on the White House lawn. After his speech, he was supposed to press a pedal which raised the platform from which the Queen was then going to speak.‘It’s satire, if you don’t like it you don’t have to read...Brits with less than six months on their passport could face...Share this article He forgot to do it and the Queen, being rather shorter, remained invisible to much of the crowd.The moment was encapsulated in the words of NBC\u0027s Jim Miklaszewski: \u0027She\u0027s gone! All I got is a talking hat!\u0027 To this day, Palace officials and diplomats still refer to the state visit as \u0027the talking hat tour\u0027.D uring her stay in Washington, the Queen had her first encounter with the President\u0027s son, George W. Bush, then in charge of the Texas Rangers baseball team. He had been forewarned by his mother not to talk to the Queen, as he could be \u0027mercurial\u0027.The Queen was rather intrigued, particularly since he was wearing cowboy boots etched with the words \u0027God Save The Queen\u0027. At one point she asked him if he was the black sheep of the family.\u0027I guess so,\u0027 replied Bush Junior.\u0027All families have them,\u0027 observed the Queen.\u0027Who\u0027s yours?\u0027 Bush Junior replied, at which point the First Lady, Barbara Bush, intervened with a cry of: \u0027Don\u0027t answer that!\u0027Relations between London and Washington cooled to a more business-like level during the Clinton years, partly because of heated disagreements over the Western response to war in Bosnia.There was no state visit in either direction in that sort of climate, but the Queen fulfilled her now-familiar role as keeper of the \u0027special relationship\u0027.The Clintons might not have had the full royal treatment at Windsor or Buckingham Palace but, in 1994, they were the Queen\u0027s guests for the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of D-Day.Only the Clintons were invited to stay aboard Britannia in Portsmouth ahead of the voyage to France the next day, accompanied by the leaders of all the allied nations and ocean liners packed with veterans.          Queen Elizabeth II stands with US President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, in the Grand Corridor during their visit to Windsor Castle in Berkshire    Andrew Parker Bowles in his army daysSpring 1980, a year before his marriage to Lady Diana Spencer, and the Prince of Wales was on his way to Rhodesia for the hand-over ceremony which would herald its rebirth as independent Zimbabwe.Arrangements for the royal visit had been made by one Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Parker Bowles and he had invited out his wife Camilla who, as the newspapers wasted no time in pointing out, was the Prince\u0027s former girlfriend.\u0027Charles\u0027s old flame lights up darkest Zimbabwe,\u0027 the Daily Mail\u0027s Nigel Dempster reported. However, it was Andrew Parker Bowles whom the Prince should have been most grateful to see.The 40-year-old Army officer had taken it upon himself to double-check every section of the royal itinerary.This included a trip to the Henderson Veterinary Research Station at Mazowe, where the vets were so convinced that they had found a way to tame the notoriously irascible African buffalo, a creature responsible for at least 200 deaths each year, that they were going to invite the Prince to ride one.          Mr Parker Bowles, earlier this monthFortunately for Prince Charles, the gallant Lieutenant Colonel decided to test-ride a buffalo himself, only to be thrown off and gored through the right thigh. A few inches further up and he would have been killed. The royal riding trip at Mazowe was now off. Had the Prince followed the Foreign Office plan, though, he would have been in grave danger. \u0027I always remind him that if it hadn\u0027t gored me and had gored him, things might be very different these days,\u0027 laughs Brigadier Parker Bowles.\u0027He gives me a wry smile and, rightly, takes it quite lightly.\u0027                                                    Adapted from Queen Of The World by Robert Hardman (Century, £25). © Robert Hardman 2018.

According to multiple sources with knowledge of the situation, the women, in their late teens or early 20s, met De La Hoya on a dating website in February and began messaging with him on Snapchat. The multi-millionaire former boxing champion and Golden Boy Promotions chairman then invited the women back to his luxury condominium in downtown Pasadena, California. The property inside The Montana building, which De La Hoya snapped up in 2017 for $2.65 million, boasts 4,150 square feet of luxurious interior space, three bedrooms, a patio and a wine cellar. Once there, it\u0027s claimed the women partied with the star before filming him on a cell phone in various \u0027embarrassing\u0027 sexual situations. De La Hoya was apparently intoxicated but aware he was being filmed. DailyMail.com has learned that weeks later the women contacted De La Hoya and allegedly demanded $2million to prevent the tape being released. It\u0027s understood the former boxer refused to pay or even negotiate so the pair then approached celebrity sex tape broker Kevin Blatt with the video.           The timing of the headline-grabbing announcement is fortuitous as La Hoya promotes the fight between Gennady Golovkin and Saul \u0027Canelo\u0027 Alvarez on September 15. Gennady Golovkin (R) exchanges blows with Canelo Alvarez (L) during their fight in 2017          If La Hoya (pictured in 2017) does decide to run, he has a few scandals in his past that could bubble up to hurt him. In April this year, the boxing legend found himself at the center of an alleged $2million extortion plot           Boxing legend Oscar De La Hoya, 45, is at the center of a $2M extortion plot after two women filmed him taking part in \u0027embarrassing\u0027 sexual acts in his home The content of the \u0027shocking\u0027 sex tape allegedly includes a totally naked De La Hoya playing the part of exhibitionist in front of two women, one blonde and one brunette, while in one scene the women are seen performing sex acts on him with kitchen utensils.   Realizing the women may be trying to extort De La Hoya, Blatt claims he turned them down. As a last ditch attempt the women also approached De La Hoya\u0027s ex-wife, actress and model Shanna Moakler. DailyMail.com understands Moakler, 43, was told the tape would humiliate her and Atiana, the 19-year-old daughter she has with De La Hoya. And again the women allegedly demanded $2million. Moakler immediately contacted De La Hoya and they both decided to inform the authorities of the alleged extortion plot. It\u0027s understood the case has now been referred to the FBI, which is investigating. A spokesperson for the FBI told DailyMail.com: \u0027We cannot confirm and or deny the existence of an investigation.\u0027 However, Hollywood sex tape broker Blatt, said: \u0027Yes two women tried to extort Oscar De La Hoya. I was contacted by someone claiming to be an Instagram model and she put me in touch with another girl. \u0027I took a meeting, I met the girl in Hollywood at a Coffee Bean, she was young and very skittish, she wore a hoodie and big glasses and tried very hard to disguise herself, she gave me a fake name of Jessica. De La Hoya\u0027s ex, actress and model Shanna Moakler (pictured in 1999) was also dragged into the investigation after the woman threatened to embarrass her and her daughter by releasing the tape  The boxing champ shares a daughter with Moakler, Atiana, 19 (pictured)           He is currently married to Puerto Rican singer Millie Corretjer (pictured in 2006) \u0027Jessica then showed me over an hour of clips from a sex tape that purportedly showed Oscar De La Hoya.

But it was clear to me Oscar had been set up. \u0027The girls even took a picture of his driver\u0027s license to prove it was him, they knew what they were doing, almost as if they had done this before. \u0027In my mind it was outright extortion and I cut ties with them immediately.\u0027 Blatt said he has reached out to De La Hoya\u0027s people and is aware that the FBI is involved, adding he\u0027d be willing to assist in any investigation. A source close to Moakler, who asked not to be named, told DailyMail.com that the former Playboy model turned reality star was interviewed by FBI investigators for two hours on Monday. The source said the incident had caused much distress to her and De La Hoya.\u0027It was very intimidating, they said they wanted $2million or they would release the tape everywhere,\u0027 the source said. \u0027But Shanna stood firm and called their bluff, she told them, \u0027go ahead release it, I don\u0027t care.\u0027 \u0027Then she immediately called Oscar and they decided to go to the authorities. It\u0027s in the hands of the FBI now, they have already interviewed Shanna.\u0027           De La Hoya invited the two women to his luxury condo in Pasadena, California where they partied with the boxer and filmed him in \u0027embarrassing\u0027 sexual situations           In one scene, the women are seen performing sex acts on him with kitchen utensils.

Moakler declined to comment. De La Hoya is no stranger to this kind of controversy. In 2007, he was the subject of a photo scandal when snaps showing the champ clad in fishnets, panties and high heels were splashed online. Serbian stripper Milana Dravnel released the photos and claimed De La Hoya had cheated on his wife with her. At the time De La Hoya\u0027s camp claimed it wasn\u0027t him in the photos and that the stripper was \u0027out for money.\u0027 His team even brought in their own \u0027photo expert,\u0027 who said the snaps were a computer-generated forgery.          In 2007, he was the subject of a photo scandal when snaps showing the champ clad in fishnets, panties and high heels were splashed onlineDravnel, who released the photos, later filed a $100million lawsuit against De La Hoya claiming he unleashed a smear campaign against her to stop the photos from emerging. The case was later settled and in 2011 De La Hoya gave a tell-all interview in which he admitted \u0027It was me\u0027 in the photos. \u0027Let me to tell you, yes, yes, it was me,\u0027 he told Spanish TV network Univision.

As a result of showing contrition after being arrested and charged, he is set to keep his captaincy.           The footballer was met by a scrum of photographers who surrounded the Frenchman          His club said the drink driving charge would be taken \u0027extremely seriously\u0027 and dealt with internallyOutlining the case, prosecutor Mr Fitch said: \u0027Shortly before 2.20am, officers were on patrol in an unmarked vehicle when their attention was drawn to a Porsche - it was moving strangely and doing 15mph in a 30mph zone.\u0027It veered a number of times towards parked vehicles, nearly clipping them, before correcting itself. It then went through a red light.\u0027Defence counsel Mr Sonn described his client\u0027s fall from grace after being arrested.He said: \u0027On July 15 he was arguably the proudest man on the planet (having captained France to the World Cup victory).\u0027Just 40 days later, he was arrested. He experienced the indignity of being handcuffed and put in a police station overnight.\u0027The spectacular fall from grace is not lost on Mr Lloris.\u0027Mr Sonn added Lloris had initially booked a taxi but it cancelled, prompting Lloris to drive - something described by Mr Sonn as \u0027the first of a number of unwise decisions\u0027.He added: \u0027By 2am he was completely drunk. At that moment he should have left the vehicle where it was. But, as Mr Lloris pointed out to me, it is when you\u0027re drunk you\u0027re likely to make mistakes - that was to drive home.\u0027           Hugo Lloris (right) had spent the evening with Olivier Giroud (centre) and Laurent Koscielny (left) before his arrestSentencing Lloris, magistrate Amanda Barron said the fine represented the seriousness of the offence as well as the goalkeeper\u0027s financial means - though details of his salary were not disclosed in court.She said: \u0027This is a very serious offence, as you know.\u0027Not only were you putting your own life at risk but also that of your passenger.\u0027It was pure luck that you did not cause damage to other vehicles or pedestrians in the central London area.\u0027 Today the footballer was met by a scrum of photographers who surrounded the Frenchman as he walked inside Westminster Magistrates\u0027 Court.Lloris, wearing a dark suit and no tie, was flanked by two members of his entourage as he made his way from his vehicle into the court, confronted by dozens of photographers and video journalists. After sentencing, Joshua Harris, director of campaigns for charity Brake, said: \u0027It is disappointing to see that someone who is a role model to many thousands of football fans has admitted breaking the law by drink-driving.\u0027We expect the captain of Tottenham Hotspur and his national team to be setting a good example, not flouting the law in such a manner.\u0027This kind of dangerous behaviour is selfish, illegal and puts lives at risk.\u0027   Lloris faced one charge of driving a motor vehicle when his alcohol level was above the limitTottenham were left understandably furious by the incident, as they were preparing for their Premier League clash with Manchester United. Lloris still started and surprisingly wore the captain\u0027s armband.What helped was the Frenchman showed public remorse after being arrested as he said in a statement: \u0027I wish to apologise wholeheartedly to my family, the club, my team-mates, the manager and all of the supporters.

The original Montgomery Guards were an Irish-American militia company that formed in Boston in 1837 and were forced to disband the following year due to extreme nativist and anti-Catholic sentiment in the city          The Gopher Gang, an Irish-American gang that, at its peak, controlled most of Manhattan, pictured around 1910 as authorities stepped up efforts to gentrify the Five Points. Based in the Irish neighborhood of Hell\u0027s Kitchen, the Gopher Gang grew to control most of Manhattan with their territory covering Fourth to Forty-Second Street and Seventh to Eleventh Avenue. The gang declined in power by the 1910s and was eventually all but destroyed in 1917 with the death of its leader and arrest of its commanding figures          Mulberry Bend, one of the most dangerous areas controlled by the Five Points gangs pictured in 1896 at the height of gang influence in the area. The original street has now been changed in layout and replaced with Mulberry Street. The area was the original home of several of the most dangerous Irish gangs in the Five Points who lived in cramped tenement buildings surrounding the bustling high street.The images show violent thugs like the Short Tail Gangs who were known to the police as hard drinkers and thieves.Also pictured are an Irish-American group known as the Gopher Gang at the peak of their power and groups of young boys robbing drunk men in New York in the early 1900s.Five Points was a nineteenth century neighbourhood in the area now known as Lower Manhattan in New York City. Sometimes considered the original American melting pot, this run-down Manhattan district became the centre of settlement for the poorest and least fortunate immigrants. Irish, Italian and Eastern European immigrants and freed Black slaves settled in Five Points.Gambling dens and brothels were numerous in the Five Points area, and it was considered a dangerous destination, where many people had been mugged particularly at night and where race riots would regularly break out. In 1842, Charles Dickens famously visited the area and was appalled by the terrible living conditions.At the height of occupation of Five Points, only certain areas of London\u0027s East End vied with it in the western world for population density, disease, child mortality, prostitution and crime.Five Points was a place where life was short and violent and the place where the original gangs of New York were formed.          A gang of young boys demonstrate how they make their living for the camera, by robbing drunk men who have passed out in the middle of the street. Pick-pocketing was one of the main rackets controlled by gangs in the Five Points who would ide up the loot from successful robberies. Alcoholism and poverty went hand-in-hand in the neighborhood which meant crude techniques like the one pictures were devastatingly effective and allowed thieves to easily get away with the crime          A busy street scene outside a hatters shop in the Five Points district of Manhattan in 1880 when gang violence was at an all-time high. Although the neighborhood was shrouded in suspicion and criminal activity there were a number of legitimate businesses which ran alongside the day-to-day organised crime syndicates. Shops like this hatters lined the busy shopping streets which were both a hub for criminals and for local business leaders  A crime scene photo at Bottle Alley, the headquarters of the Irish-American Whyos Gang.

According to local sources in one building known as the \u0027Old Brewery\u0027 there was at least one murder per night at the height of the gang\u0027s power          Members of the Five Points Gang, an Italian American gang founded around 1880, whose later members included the most famous gangster of all time - Al Capone. After becoming a predominantly Irish neighborhood during a wave of immigration in the 1860s, the Five Points found a new Italian influence thrust upon the area with a new wave of arrivals in the 1880s. Some of the new Italian immigrants had connections within the Mafia and were experienced crime bosses back in their old countryOrganized criminal gangs, like the Bowery Boys, the Dead Rabbits, the Short Tails, the Gopher Gang, the Whyos Gang and the Montgomery Guards cropped up across Manhattan.Each group had had their own way of letting people know who they stood with. The Bowery Boys, a gang mainly made up of firefighters, would go out in red shirts and stovepipe hats the Short Tails went out with their shirt untucked and the Irish Dead Rabbits would head out with a rabbit nailed to a stick.Meanwhile the Whyos - an Irish-American criminal group who ranged from pickpockets to murderers - had a distinctive gang\u0027s cry which sounded like a bird or owl calling \u0027Why-oh!\u0027 to let people know they were on the streets.All of the gangs of Five Points competed for control of the revenue made from illicit activities and fights would break out over most anything.The Five Points gangs made their neighborhood one of the deadliest places on earth. It was said that they had the highest murder rate of any slum in the world. According to the legends, the most dangerous building - a housing tenement called the \u0027Old Brewery\u0027 - saw a murder every single night.          The Short Tail Gang, a violent group of thugs and one of the most feared of the Five Points gangs, was reportedly known to the police for being \u0027hard drinkers, highwaymen and thieves\u0027. They were recognisable in the streets around the Five Points because of their distinctive style of dressing. They can be seen here wearing their characteristic short-tailed coats which gave the gang its name          One of four men sharing a single cellar beneath a tenement home, circa 1880.

The Whyos were so called because they made a distinctive call to one another where they shouted \u0027Why-o\u0027 in the street to mark themselves out as gang membersAbove all, it was nationality and race that turned the Five Points gangs against one another. Riots and fights broke out between the staunchly anti-Catholic Bowery Boys and the Irish Dead Rabbits.In one brutal two-day battle, an estimated 1,000 people took to the streets of New York to fight, beating each other senseless and looting one another\u0027s homes. By the time the blood had dried, eight men were dead and up to a hundred more lay injured - an event that inspired Martin Scorsese\u0027s 2002 film Gangs of New York.For a century, these notorious gangs ruled their neighbourhood but by the early 1900s, Five Points was torn down piece by piece. Politicians railed for it to be ripped apart with one telling his constituent, \u0027This hot-bed of infamy, this modern Sodom, is situated in the very heart of your City!\u0027  The crime-riddled Old Brewery was pulled down, missionary houses were brought in, and bit by bit, the face of the city changed.The Five Points gangs were broken up and slowly faded into history. These images remember their notorious legacy.          Four homeless men lay passed out on the steps of a dilapidated home in the Five Points around 1880 when the neighborhood was its most impoverished. Various efforts by different charitable organizations and iniduals, most Christian themed, attempted to ameliorate the suffering of the poor in Five Points. Towards the beginning of the 20th century the area was completely redeveloped and upgraded          Inside of a tenement in Hell\u0027s Kitchen where several women and men are crowded into a small room and forced to wrap up in several layers to protect them from the cold. Disease was rife among the residents in the Five Points. The lack of scientific knowledge, sanitation systems, the numerous overcrowded dwellings, and absence of even rudimentary health care made impoverished areas such as Five Points ideal for the development and spread of these diseases          A cobbler taking a break from making shoes and eating some bread inside of a tenement in Five Points, New York city, circa 1880. Among the criminals, enterprising iniduals were able to flourish and the streets of the neighborhood were awash with craftsmen selling everything from hats to shoes and unique garments. Skilled laborers had come over from Ireland and Italy and were able to peddle their wares in New York as they had done in their old country          An illegal tenement in the neighborhood which crammed in residents for the price of five cents a spot despite the fact there was limited floor space. At the height of occupation of Five Points, only certain areas of London\u0027s East End vied with it in the western world for population density, disease, infant and child mortality, unemployment, prostitution, violent crime, and other classic ills of the urban destitute          Women lodge inside of the local police station during a typhus epidemic in the 1880s. Diseases were common in the Five Points because of poor living conditions. Several epidemics swept the City of New York in the 18th and 19th centuries, some of which originated in Five Points. Others were introduced by passengers disembarking from ships from overseas, including immigrants          A busy street scene in the Five Points during the 1890s as ramshackle housing developments began to be replaced with more permanent structures and shops. The area formerly occupied by Five Points was gradually redeveloped through the twentieth century. In the west and south, it is occupied by major federal, state, and city administration buildings and courthouses known collectively as Civic Center, Manhattan.          This modern day picture is taken where the centre of the Five Points neighbourhood used to be in the 19th century, now a bustling area of Lower Manhattan. The northeastern and eastern portion of Five Points is now within the sprawling Chinatown.

Currently, I do not even know if any of our manufacturing facilities in the UK will be able to function on the 30th.‘Like many British companies our supply chains reach deep into Europe. Bluntly, we will not be able to build cars, if the motorway to and from Dover becomes a car park, where the vehicle carrying parts – vital to our processes – is stationary.’JLR is already in the process of opening a new £1billion plant in Nitra, Slovakia, where its new Land Rover Discovery is being built. The decision to shift production from Birmingham – putting hundreds of jobs at risk – was announced in June.But Mr Speth hinted that this could be just the start, warning that it is already ‘thousands of pounds cheaper to produce vehicles in Slovakia than Solihull’ due to higher costs and the UK’s ‘poor productivity rates’.The Prime Minister’s spokesman said her Chequers Brexit plan included proposals to protect jobs in areas that rely on ‘just-in-time’ supply chains.He insisted it would ‘help ensure frictionless trade with the EU and would see our car sector to continue to flourish’."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/11/18/50001A9D00000578-0-image-m-19_1536686258856.jpg","title":"Jeremy Corbyns Private Secretary no security clearance parliament","story":"    Iram Awan (right with Corbyn), a British-born national, has allegedly not been granted a pass because of concerns over her known associatesShe has accessed Parliament through both entrances and been routinely escorted in by members of Corbyn\u0027s team, the publication reported.Awan is said to have been using a visitor pass to enter, meaning she has to go through security checks and X-rays on the way in. A Parliamentary spokesman said: \u0027Visitor passes are for visitors only they cannot be used to carry out work on the parliamentary estate.\u0027While we are unable to comment on specific cases, any alleged breach of the rules on passes will be investigated by the House authorities.Jeremy Corbyn praised activist who smeared pro-Palestine...\u0027The deselection train has pulled into Westminster\u0027:...Share this article\u0027Anyone carrying out work on the estate must have been through the vetting process and hold a Parliamentary pass.

It\u0027s understood the case has now been referred to the FBI, which is investigating. A spokesperson for the FBI told DailyMail.com: \u0027We cannot confirm and or deny the existence of an investigation.\u0027 However, Hollywood sex tape broker Blatt, said: \u0027Yes two women tried to extort Oscar De La Hoya.

The gang declined in power by the 1910s and was eventually all but destroyed in 1917 with the death of its leader and arrest of its commanding figures          Mulberry Bend, one of the most dangerous areas controlled by the Five Points gangs pictured in 1896 at the height of gang influence in the area.

Sometimes considered the original American melting pot, this run-down Manhattan district became the centre of settlement for the poorest and least fortunate immigrants. Irish, Italian and Eastern European immigrants and freed Black slaves settled in Five Points.Gambling dens and brothels were numerous in the Five Points area, and it was considered a dangerous destination, where many people had been mugged particularly at night and where race riots would regularly break out. In 1842, Charles Dickens famously visited the area and was appalled by the terrible living conditions.At the height of occupation of Five Points, only certain areas of London\u0027s East End vied with it in the western world for population density, disease, child mortality, prostitution and crime.Five Points was a place where life was short and violent and the place where the original gangs of New York were formed.          A gang of young boys demonstrate how they make their living for the camera, by robbing drunk men who have passed out in the middle of the street. Pick-pocketing was one of the main rackets controlled by gangs in the Five Points who would ide up the loot from successful robberies. Alcoholism and poverty went hand-in-hand in the neighborhood which meant crude techniques like the one pictures were devastatingly effective and allowed thieves to easily get away with the crime          A busy street scene outside a hatters shop in the Five Points district of Manhattan in 1880 when gang violence was at an all-time high. Although the neighborhood was shrouded in suspicion and criminal activity there were a number of legitimate businesses which ran alongside the day-to-day organised crime syndicates. Shops like this hatters lined the busy shopping streets which were both a hub for criminals and for local business leaders  A crime scene photo at Bottle Alley, the headquarters of the Irish-American Whyos Gang.

After becoming a predominantly Irish neighborhood during a wave of immigration in the 1860s, the Five Points found a new Italian influence thrust upon the area with a new wave of arrivals in the 1880s. Some of the new Italian immigrants had connections within the Mafia and were experienced crime bosses back in their old countryOrganized criminal gangs, like the Bowery Boys, the Dead Rabbits, the Short Tails, the Gopher Gang, the Whyos Gang and the Montgomery Guards cropped up across Manhattan.Each group had had their own way of letting people know who they stood with. The Bowery Boys, a gang mainly made up of firefighters, would go out in red shirts and stovepipe hats the Short Tails went out with their shirt untucked and the Irish Dead Rabbits would head out with a rabbit nailed to a stick.Meanwhile the Whyos - an Irish-American criminal group who ranged from pickpockets to murderers - had a distinctive gang\u0027s cry which sounded like a bird or owl calling \u0027Why-oh!\u0027 to let people know they were on the streets.All of the gangs of Five Points competed for control of the revenue made from illicit activities and fights would break out over most anything.The Five Points gangs made their neighborhood one of the deadliest places on earth. It was said that they had the highest murder rate of any slum in the world. According to the legends, the most dangerous building - a housing tenement called the \u0027Old Brewery\u0027 - saw a murder every single night.          The Short Tail Gang, a violent group of thugs and one of the most feared of the Five Points gangs, was reportedly known to the police for being \u0027hard drinkers, highwaymen and thieves\u0027. They were recognisable in the streets around the Five Points because of their distinctive style of dressing. They can be seen here wearing their characteristic short-tailed coats which gave the gang its name          One of four men sharing a single cellar beneath a tenement home, circa 1880.

The Whyos were so called because they made a distinctive call to one another where they shouted \u0027Why-o\u0027 in the street to mark themselves out as gang membersAbove all, it was nationality and race that turned the Five Points gangs against one another. Riots and fights broke out between the staunchly anti-Catholic Bowery Boys and the Irish Dead Rabbits.In one brutal two-day battle, an estimated 1,000 people took to the streets of New York to fight, beating each other senseless and looting one another\u0027s homes. By the time the blood had dried, eight men were dead and up to a hundred more lay injured - an event that inspired Martin Scorsese\u0027s 2002 film Gangs of New York.For a century, these notorious gangs ruled their neighbourhood but by the early 1900s, Five Points was torn down piece by piece. Politicians railed for it to be ripped apart with one telling his constituent, \u0027This hot-bed of infamy, this modern Sodom, is situated in the very heart of your City!\u0027  The crime-riddled Old Brewery was pulled down, missionary houses were brought in, and bit by bit, the face of the city changed.The Five Points gangs were broken up and slowly faded into history. These images remember their notorious legacy.          Four homeless men lay passed out on the steps of a dilapidated home in the Five Points around 1880 when the neighborhood was its most impoverished. Various efforts by different charitable organizations and iniduals, most Christian themed, attempted to ameliorate the suffering of the poor in Five Points. Towards the beginning of the 20th century the area was completely redeveloped and upgraded          Inside of a tenement in Hell\u0027s Kitchen where several women and men are crowded into a small room and forced to wrap up in several layers to protect them from the cold. Disease was rife among the residents in the Five Points. The lack of scientific knowledge, sanitation systems, the numerous overcrowded dwellings, and absence of even rudimentary health care made impoverished areas such as Five Points ideal for the development and spread of these diseases          A cobbler taking a break from making shoes and eating some bread inside of a tenement in Five Points, New York city, circa 1880. Among the criminals, enterprising iniduals were able to flourish and the streets of the neighborhood were awash with craftsmen selling everything from hats to shoes and unique garments. Skilled laborers had come over from Ireland and Italy and were able to peddle their wares in New York as they had done in their old country          An illegal tenement in the neighborhood which crammed in residents for the price of five cents a spot despite the fact there was limited floor space. At the height of occupation of Five Points, only certain areas of London\u0027s East End vied with it in the western world for population density, disease, infant and child mortality, unemployment, prostitution, violent crime, and other classic ills of the urban destitute          Women lodge inside of the local police station during a typhus epidemic in the 1880s. Diseases were common in the Five Points because of poor living conditions. Several epidemics swept the City of New York in the 18th and 19th centuries, some of which originated in Five Points. Others were introduced by passengers disembarking from ships from overseas, including immigrants          A busy street scene in the Five Points during the 1890s as ramshackle housing developments began to be replaced with more permanent structures and shops. The area formerly occupied by Five Points was gradually redeveloped through the twentieth century. In the west and south, it is occupied by major federal, state, and city administration buildings and courthouses known collectively as Civic Center, Manhattan.          This modern day picture is taken where the centre of the Five Points neighbourhood used to be in the 19th century, now a bustling area of Lower Manhattan. The northeastern and eastern portion of Five Points is now within the sprawling Chinatown.

No wonder Dennis the Menace has already moved inPart cliff face, part galleon, the new V\u0026ampA Dundee stands on the banks of the Tay like a curious craft sailed in from another realm. It is at once primal and futuristic, its great hull-like forms covered in slabs of gnarled concrete that fragment in places as they rise, as if already ruined. From some angles, the twisting mass reveals the gaping mouth of a cave. From others, it is like encountering the ribbed carcass of a beached whale, or the bones of a shipwreck.It is a fitting form, given the rocky ride this £80m project has endured over the last decade, buffeted by multiple storms of cost escalation, construction delays and accusations of gross mismanagement. Originally planned with a budget of £27m, then £45m, and intended to rise out of the churning waters of the Tay, the building has retreated to dry land, and finally been completed at almost double the cost, four years late.“If we want to make something closer to nature than a building, then the costs are always unpredictable,” says Kengo Kuma, the feted Japanese architect responsible for summoning this great geological object from the riverbed. “We encountered many unexpected things along the way.”The history of the project follows a familiar story of an inexperienced client seduced by a thrilling competition image and only worrying about practicalities later. An independent report published in 2015 listed a damning catalogue of failures in procurement, governance, project management and cost control. It concluded that the client body, Design Dundee Ltd (a partnership of the V\u0026ampA, Dundee city council, Scottish Enterprise, the University of Dundee and Abertay University) had little chance of realising the building on budget from the start.But it stands there now, beside a similarly ambitious neighbour in the RRS Discovery, the ship that sailed Scott and Shackleton to Antarctica in the early 1900s. They are a pair of structures alike in their bravery-verging-on-recklessness.Standing as two inverted pyramidal forms that join together as they rise, creating an archway that frames views of the river, Kuma’s building has a magnetic presence, enticing you to explore its chiselled clefts. It may no longer stand entirely in the Tay, but shallow pools of water lap at its base, while one prow plunges straight into the fast-flowing river, ensuring that much of the original intention survives. Bracing east-coast winds whistle through the tunnelled archway, reinforcing the elemental feeling of standing at the edge of the land – and encouraging you to seek swift shelter inside.As you enter through a slanting triangular opening sliced beneath a deep overhang, the rough concrete panels give way to a warm, bright interior lined with layers of wooden flaps, set at odd angles as if caught in a breeze. Fixed with the same jumbled irregularity as the concrete cladding, this rippling panelled lining adds a surreal quality, as if you have just walked into a scaled-up model.“I like to make my buildings out of particles,” says Kuma, who is known for cladding his structures with many small pieces, whether making a screen of tiles suspended in a wire rigging for his Folk Art Museum in Hangzhou, China, or bolting milky glass panels on to the facade of his FRAC art gallery in Marseille. “It avoids the big boring wall, and gives intimacy to a space,” he adds. “And it can teach us about depth, size and shadow. A white abstract box cannot teach us anything.”These might sound like the gnomic pronouncements of a Shinto sage, but Kuma’s best buildings create richly layered spaces that delight in the effects of light filtering through their various parts. The V\u0026ampA Dundee is more bunker-like than his lighter timber concoctions in Japan, and some of the details a bit more clunky, but the effects are there. The building’s angled stony strata catch changing light throughout the day and are illuminated through the reflecting pools by night up close, their rough-cast texture echoes Scottish harling, forming giant cliff faces of pebbledash.The cave-like entrance leads to a gaping interior volume, where a shallow black marble stair climbs around a large open floor taken up by a cafe, shop and ticket desk, while a long wooden bench rings the edge of the room. It is large and open enough to feel like a true public space for the city, influenced by project architect Maurizio Mucciola. “Being Italian, my reference for public space is a nice cosy square, like you get in Venice,” he says, “where you can just sit with a spritz and watch the world go by.”Proceeding up above this generous indoor piazza, you come to the main event: two large gallery spaces, one dedicated to Scottish design, the other a column-free hangar of a room for temporary exhibitions, opening with the Ocean Liners show, which began in London earlier this year but is here given more space to breathe. At 1,100 sq m, equivalent to the V\u0026ampA’s new subterranean extension in London, it is the largest museum-standard exhibition space in Scotland, and it will receive touring shows as well as initiate its own.Designed by museum experts ZMMA, the Scottish Design Galleries are a tour de force, showcasing a dazzling array of 300 objects designed or made in Scotland, from Hunter wellies to the Duchess of Roxburghe’s diamond-winged tiara, and original Dennis the Menace artwork from the Beano, produced by Dundee-based publishers DC Thomson. A sci-fi Paisley cloak from a recent Star Wars film is a suitably futuristic accessory for Kuma’s stone spaceship, while a star of the show is Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s Oak Room from the Ingram Street tearooms, restored and on display for the first time in 50 years.The display provides an illuminating lesson on the vitality and originality of Scottish design throughout the ages, which makes what is happening outside the window even more hard to swallow. While competition images and PR shots show the V\u0026ampA building in splendid isolation, the reality is anything but. The view of the museum from Dundee’s Georgian city centre is already partially blocked by the hulking frame of a new hotel and offset by a garish new railway station, both part of a £1bn waterfront masterplan to “connect the city with the river”. As in many waterside regeneration schemes the world over, from Salford to Cape Town, this means the hasty erection of commercial buildings around the new cultural anchor, built under the banner of “bringing life” to the place. Sadly, it seems that all of the architectural effort has been lavished on the museum, with little care for how the rest of the pieces hang together.Thankfully, Kuma’s concrete culture ship is tough enough to withstand whatever the developers want to throw at it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fc0f9c2556db6ee941f75058a82e11a97b0d632/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc91e2df6bc1f77006933d1c710537a0","title":"not the booker sweet fruit sour land by rebecca ley review post apocalyptic confusion","story":"Political incompetence and male entitlement speak to our times, but it’s not enough to make up for an obscure setting and laboured proseThere’s no faulting the timeliness of Sweet Fruit, Sour Land. It’s set in a Britain destroyed by famine and shortages of material goods. The leader of the country is a woman who churns out meaningless slogans but achieves nothing. The men beneath her – judging by a minister we meet called George – are deceitful, selfish, violent abusers of truth and seducers of women. You don’t need me to draw the parallels.Rebecca Ley’s novel is given urgency by the mess of Brexit and revelations of #MeToo – but it isn’t a straightforward future projection of our current problems. The prime minister turns out to be some kind of socialist who says she has nationalised power supplies and made things more “fair and equal” than they were during the days of a mysterious “blackout”. The memo about equality hasn’t filtered through to the rest of her government, however. George has been attending Versailles-style parties where tables groan with foods that normal people can only dream of eating.One of the novel’s two narrators, Mathilde, is scratching out a living in London as a seamstress after fleeing from a France that has burnt dry. It is at one of these buffets that George meets Mathilde, who has been invited after her grandmother helped create the hostess’s dress:I watched her putting the last glinting sequin onto the skirt long enough for the tallest of women until it fell, complete, around the floor of the workshop, reminding me of a fish I hadn’t seen from a sea I hadn’t seen.At this early stage in the novel, I was prepared to forgive Mathilde the odd bit of gnomic-nonsense. She hasn’t had it easy, after all. As she recalls increasingly unpleasant interactions with the domineering George, it becomes clear she has been brutalised.Mathilde isn’t the only one to have suffered. A parallel narrative told in the present tense by Jaminder – a woman Mathilde encounters at that fateful party – tells us how the two women flee to Scotland. There they bring up a young son on oatmeal and the dwindling supply of food they scavenge from abandoned supermarkets.While the problems in London spring from drought and an overpowering heat that destroys all crops, Scotland is reduced to oatmeal because “the rain never ceases”. There is, of course, a rich tradition of post-apocalyptic fiction where much of the menace and mystery comes from the reader never fully understanding what’s going on. But it’s sometimes hard to know if the explanations offered in Sweet Fruit, Sour Land are deliberately obscure or just confused:One evening, bam… No power. Nothing. Only darkness… There were no warnings. They said fuel was running out, but they didn’t say it was going to run out today. It’s a bit like death isn’t it? We knew it was coming, we just didn’t think it would come so soon… Months went by like that protests, riots, famine… mechanised industry ground to a halt. Eventually the energy companies stepped up the renewable stuff but it was only enough for the odd hour here and there.Could “fuel” really run out so fast? My faith wavered because so many other logistical questions began to trouble me. Why was everyone so easily able to get hold of candles when everything else was in such short supply? Why was it so straightforward for a stranger such as Mathilde to turn up at those parties where all those powerful people were gathered – not to mention so much food? Where was the security? At one point, Jaminder finds a bike and talks about it like it’s a rarity – but wouldn’t there be endless bikes in all the abandoned houses?The narrators’ sincerity is never in any doubt, and there are a few good moments of emotion around their helpless child. But too much of the book is a repetitive litany of things that don’t work anymore, and there are too many sentences that strain to be plangent but don’t quite make it. “It wasn’t long before summer would hit like a wall of clanging humidity.” Like a what kind of wall? “‘No one’s normal,’ I say and think that if humanity has learnt nothing, that would be the nothing they’ve learnt.” Ah, yes.The only difference between these two ponderous voices are the tirades Jaminder addresses to George, who gradually develops into an absurd caricature of the evil patriarchy (he even starts pantomime-villain-laughing at another character’s distress). Worse still, the plot has little sense of movement. Mathilde’s story builds to an inevitable crisis and Jaminder’s meanders around nowhere. Despite the novel’s relevance and undoubted good intentions, it soon becomes too hard to care.Next time: The Ruin by Dervla McTiernanLast week: Raising Sparks by Ariel Kahn"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54ff1699e94e330b169a1d8885bbdd3f5a5f33b5/173_78_4185_2511/master/4185.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e955e5a04ebfccf4ccd52e82c0f8ef06","title":"london street signs nameplates instagram","story":"Graphic designer Alistair Hall uses Instagram to highlight the city’s significant nameplatesStreet signs tell us not only where we are but also where we’ve been, with their typography and styles stretching back centuries.The graphic designer Alistair Hall is using Instagram to draw attention to them.

It’s the political hot potato of the hourThis week, the polling consultancy and oxymoron Britain Thinks revealed the news that the majority of swing-voters think that, if Labour were a food, it would be quinoa. Personally I’m glad we’ve reached this level of Buzzfeedy polling questions, but that’s only because I’ve always wanted to know which Disney villain Nick Clegg is (my bet: the prince from Frozen, the biggest scumbag in the CGI Disney universe).To me, the poll seemed a little off. Sure, there are similarities between the pretentious South American grain and a socialist party: they’re both things that Londoners were recently obsessed with but are now considered a bit passé, they both have scarily dedicated supporters, and an intensive cultivation of both has led indirectly to the collapse of the Venezuelan economy. But really quinoa is less of a food and more of an edible hacky punchline, a cultural touchstone for smug pricks, replacing kale (2010-2015), hummus (2000-2010) and goji berries (about two weeks in 2010) as the go-to joke food about out-of-touch middle class istas (hi!). If we really want to know which foods best represent our modern political parties and our politicians, we’re going to need subtler foods – foods with nuance, intelligence and integrity.Which is why, after many hours of research and consulting over a dozen BBC Good Food recipes on an empty stomach, I have worked out the answers to the question that has been haunting us for 72 hours now: if our political leaders were foods, what kind of foods would they be?The thing about a Gastropub gruyere cheese souffle is, on the menu, it sounds quite good. As you’re waiting for it, you kid yourself into thinking that it might be exactly what you need – after years of stodgy boorish pub burgers, maybe this souffle will shake things up a bit. Its mysterious gelatinous qualities could challenge your tastebuds to work in dynamic new ways, its exotic cheesy aroma could make you popular with the European friends you’re sitting next to, and its firm texture could help it stand up to the violent acid reflux in your stomach (yes, in this metaphor, right-wing Brexiteers are acid reflux). Truly, this souffle might be the best souffle since Thatcher.And then it arrives, and you’re instantly filled with regret. The sides have burnt, the cheese looked pre-grated, and worst of all, it has collapsed under the pressure to a stodgy, eggy mess, just as bad for you as the burgers. You look at it and you wonder who it was supposed to appeal to. You shake your head and hiss at it. “How dare you think you could cure my hunger. How dare you presume something as insubstantial as you could tackle something as important as this, now, at such a crucial moment in our nation’s history. HOW DARE YOU.”Long story short, the souffle gets quietly axed in the next menu reshuffle because of all those people it deported during the Windrush scandal and you are asked never to return to The Lamb and Flag.At first you can’t blame the sugarless biscuit. I mean, sure, it’s a bit tough, but maybe after years of sugar and sweetness it’s time for something healthy to rebalance your body fatthe wider economy. And sure, there seem to be a few wronguns who like snacking on the biscuits while simultaneously accusing Jewish people of being part of some worldwide media conspiracy – but hey, that’s hardly the biscuit’s fault, right?But then you start to notice the biscuit is the snack of choice at a truly worrying number of events involving Holocaust deniers, and you start to get a bit worried. What’s more, when you mention this upsetting fact to fans of the sugarless biscuit, they tend not to take it on board, but instead accuse you of never liking the sugarless biscuit in the first place. You’ve been looking for an excuse to eat a Hobnob since 2015. If you like a bit of chocolate on your biscuit, piss off and join the (Rotary) Club. And you say, “No! I still like a lot of what the sugarless biscuit stands for! I still think there’s a better version of the sugar-filled society that’s killing us all that we have right now! But I just think that there must be a way to eat those biscuits without condoning racism!”Long story short, eating the biscuit (renamed the Corbunion Wafer) becomes the only way you can join the Labour Party, and you are never to return to the biscuit aisle of that particular Morrisons.It used to be popular – or at least, acceptable to say that you liked it – but now it just feels like a relic of a bygone era, a beige slush that just makes people feel shame for ever having tried it. Also, it’s exactly the wrong level of European: suspicious enough for Brexiteers to stay away from it, but not enough to make any self-respecting European buy into it. Having said that, it will probably survive – when the other foodstuffs are dead and buried, as the world burns in a post-apocalyptic landscape, you’ll be searching through freezers in abandoned Aldis and find that 70-year-old caramel Viennetta is still droning on about how AV would have prevented this mess.It’s so obscure that you’re almost positive it’s not really a thing and it’s actually something from a forgotten Mitchell and Webb sketch, but you don’t want to say to reveal your ignorance. Coincidentally, it’s also the only thing you’ll be allowed to eat after March 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da34a819ccc13d11f138c36b76510277d531a76c/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b06d57d7603dd97011664b45542ecbe3","title":"huge roof bar royal festival hall condemned shocking","story":"Exclusive: plans would harm London building regarded as one of Britain’s finest, say activistsA secret plan to install an enormous bar and restaurant on the roof of the Royal Festival Hall has been condemned as shocking, insensitive and harmful for a building regarded as one of the finest examples of 20th-century British architecture. can reveal that the Southbank Centre and a commercial partner, the Incipio Group, have applied for permission to erect a temporary, transparent pavilion on the flat roof. Covering 686 sq metres of floor space, it would be open until 2am at weekends and offer diners and drinkers spectacular views of the Thames.The idea is that the Pergola on the River, as it would be called, would be in place for three years. It would then be removed and the arts centre would go ahead with a long-held ambition to use the roof for open-air performances.But the Twentieth Century Society, a conservation group, said it was shocked by the proposals and would be objecting in the strongest terms.Grace Etherington, the society’s caseworker, said the plans would obscure the distinctive signage of the Grade I-listed building as well as the curved roof behind it. “It is a landmark building and the riverside frontage is fundamental to its significance,” she said. “This is not the right location for an off-the -peg design.”She said the hall and surrounding buildings “represent the best of 20th-century architecture in this country and they should be cherished rather than treated in such a shocking and insensitive way”.Historic England has also recommended refusal “because of the serious and unjustified harm” it would cause to the Royal Festival Hall.But the centre says it cannot carry out much-needed upgrades to the hall or implement its plan for rooftop performances without the money from a commercial restaurant and bar.The application says there are “considerable maintenance and capital works costs” for the hall. Required works include roof repairs, waterproofing, redecoration and security improvements. The last refurbishment took place in 2007.“Despite this challenging financial environment, the government continues to encourage Southbank Centre to be innovative and entrepreneurial in developing a erse funding base,” the application says.Incipio specialises in creating pop-up venues in interesting and temporarily vacant spaces. Other locations it has been involved with include on top of a vacant platform at Paddington station.Its plan for the Royal Festival Hall would involve “a relatively small, lightweight structure” that would be 4.9 metres high and extend along the north facade of the hall. It would have a maximum capacity of 220 people. The proposed opening hours are 11am-1am Sunday to Wednesday and 11am-2am Thursday to Saturday.The hall’s familiar lettering would be replicated on the front of the temporary structure.Discussions with Lambeth council first began in March and have involved Historic England.The Twentieth Century Society said it was consulted at the pre-application stage but despite strong objections “the scheme has only undergone minimal revision”.After the three years as a restaurant and bar, the space would become an open-air venue for performances including dance, cabaret and comedy. The plans anticipate it being open from April to November, hosting 30 to 40 performances a year.The application says the Pergola would be “an enabling development” to help pay for improvements to the Royal Festival Hall and “help to realise the exciting new arts and cultural programming space”.The hall was designed by London county council’s architectural team, led by Leslie Martin, and opened in 1951, the focal point of the Festival of Britain.It is not the first time the centre has been involved in a planning row. In 2013 it proposed a £100m glass pavilion that would have floated above the grey bulk of the centre. The plans would have meant moving the skateboard park on the riverfront in order to build more shops and restaurants.Among the successful objectors were the then National Theatre director, Nicholas Hytner, who argued it would cause “irreparable harm”, and the then London mayor, Boris Johnson, who supported the skateboarders.The Southbank Centre declined to comment further."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7489d50154438b16ed99694480e6d5415e1b7a02/0_0_3543_2425/master/3543.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e88dc113bd4dc972c88aa7bcf1cbc2c 700w","title":"how to fit in at london fashion week a beginners guide","story":"For first timers, it’s all about how you define yourself – are you an alpha, a beta or a gamma?London fashion week starts on Friday and I am going for the first time.

They pick out three outfits every day – and another for the evening (they are not FARMERS, as 30 Rock’s Jack Donaghy would say) – and their entire sense of self hangs on whether a 19-year-old blogger photographs them for their streetstyle Tumblr and what seat a harassed PR put them in for the show.And yet the alpha and the beta are very different beasts. The beta cares and shows everyone they care the alpha cares, but pretends they do not. So, if the beta is photographed by streetstyle bloggers on her way into a fashion show, she will frantically hunt down that photo online and put it all over her social media (total beta move). The alpha, by contrast, will treat the style bloggers as pesky irritations, her eyes heavy with patient irritation as she explains to the panting masses whether her jumpsuit is from Chloé or Céline. Should anyone tell her later that her photo made it on to the front page of a popular fashion website, she will feign interest before turning away and pointedly not Googling said website.Then there’s the seating. By now, everyone (even the gammas – even the omegas!) knows that the row you are in is a reflection of how important you are considered to be. So, a beta will go through all of their invitations as soon as they arrive if they are anywhere other than the first row, they will have their assistant call up and scream at the PR. An alpha will not take their invitation out of its envelope until they arrive at the show venue. They will then simply take their seat in the fourth row and effect an air of such otherworldly indifference that it will be communicated telepathically to the nearest PR, who will rush over and put the alpha in the front row. All the while, the alpha will insist they really aren’t bothered. At this point, the beta will be booted out of their precious seat and moved to the dreaded second row to make room for the alpha, thus occasioning the mother of all beta meltdowns, which the alpha will ignore by gazing serenely at the runway.So all you need to do for fashion week, Cara, is to decide whether you are an alpha, a beta or a gamma. Good luck, my child."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12a584fc1f33f1fae893f561f7d1d28482af33a3/521_73_3574_2146/master/3574.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7e5e49cd9de508f0532063f131d44fc","title":"fenella fielding peter bradshaw appreciation","story":"She became synonymous with her slinky vamp in Carry on Screaming, but Fenella Fielding was a richly intelligent stage performer who came within a whisker of being Fellini’s museSome time in the late 1960s, Federico Fellini is said to have taken the beautiful young Fenella Fielding out to dinner at Claridge’s in London and offered her a movie that he would direct, featuring her in half a dozen roles: a sensational showcase. But Fielding turned him down, on the grounds that she was booked for a theatrical season at Chichester. It may not have happened quite that way – Fielding had a mischievous way of exaggerating anecdotes for the benefit of saucer-eyed interviewers. But however serious or merely seductive Fellini’s movie idea (did he expansively improvise it over brandies?), the great director was undoubtedly impressed with Fielding’s acting talent. She was a brilliant interpreter of Wilde and Ibsen on stage and had written and performed one-woman revue shows at the time of the Peter Cook satire boom. Perhaps Fellini was also a little in love with her.What would have happened if Fielding had somehow broken her Chichester contract and done the Fellini film? Perhaps her career and public reputation would have gone another way, and she would have achieved a position in film to match the very real respect she had earned in the theatre.As things turned out, she was destined to be remembered for just one thing, and she good-humouredly accepted that: a sexy-campy-vampy cartoon persona. This was most obviously her slinky Valeria in Carry on Screaming (1966), in which she reclines languorously on a chaise-longue, asks Harry H Corbett’s uptight-but-tempted police inspector: “Do you mind if I smoke?” and starts to emit vapour from her whole body. “And I was trying to give up!” says Corbett, reaching eagerly into the fog. That deathless line became the title of her autobiography. Everyone agreed that Fenella Fielding was smoking hot.Many talented actors have their careers derailed by one distinctive thing about them, which goes from meal ticket to millstone. Fielding became the victim-beneficiary of that extraordinary voice: outrageously, hilariously velvety and kittenish. In her early movie career, doing light comedies such as the Doctor movies and a farce with Norman Wisdom (whom she detested), she just sounded posh, husky and sexy. If things had been different, she could have had Joanna Lumley’s career. But everyone could see how well the voice played on screen. Fielding prudently declined to do any more Carry Ons after that, seeing all too clearly how she would be imprisoned. But it defined her.In her film career, she was arguably the equivalent of Kenneth Williams, who played her brother in Carry on Screaming: the absurd undead scientist Dr Orlando Watt. He, too, was a very intelligent stage performer, great raconteur and chatshow turn with a richly resonant voice that he allowed to become a self-parody he was tempted into the cul-de-sac of popular British cinema at a time when that appeared to offer regular work and the easy hit of popular fame. But it was a Faustian bargain. As for Fielding, she continued to work in television and the theatre, including some stints with Morecambe and Wise (unlike Gerald Thomas’s stingy Carry On film deals, TV work with Eric and Ernie would have earned her handsome payments for their endless repeats). She became something like a national treasure, and her theatre work is a cherished memory. It would have been interesting if someone had offered her a decent film role."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5555deb3fa3846fa39ca945f3afd31433fd4e94/0_0_1546_928/master/1546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=397f2c667a6019a1ddbd335452a5118e","title":"red joan review judi dench","story":"Dench is a pensioner pulled up for her wartime sympathies in a stodgy espionage drama that can’t disguise its mediocrity“No one suspects us because we’re women,” smiles one feminine conspirator to another in Trevor Nunn’s wartime spy drama Red Joan. Never mind all the espionage and atomic physics, this movie is really about the dangers of underestimating women. Our Joan is patronised in two different eras of her life, both as the pensioner charged with treason and as a demure Cambridge scientist in the 1940s, who slips nuclear secrets to the Soviets on the sly.The older Joan, played all too briefly by Judi Dench, is a retired and softly spoken librarian apparently engrossed in watercolours and gardening. Her friends, neighbours and even her adult sonare flabbergasted when the police come knocking. Surely the old dear can’t have snow on her boots? These dopes haven’t clocked her Che Guevara coffee mug. As the police interrogate her, flashbacks take us back to her youth as a susceptible student, singled out by conniving communists at a screening of Battleship Potemkin.After graduating with a first, young Joan (Sophie Cookson) gets a job on a top-secret research project, but only as an assistant. Her role is to type and file. Her expertise comes as a bonus – as does her beauty. Joan’s creepy nuclear scientist boss stumbles over the mental gymnastics required to compliment a woman on both her brains and her looks, calling her “not not a pretty face”. The socialist contacts Joan picked up in her undergrad years are the surprise that the dolts in this lab almost deserve.Most of the fun in Red Joan comes from such overthrown expectations, so it’s a shame that the film itself fails to overwhelm – mostly proceeding along dully familiar lines and anything but radical. The script is adapted from a novel by Jennie Rooney, itself inspired by the true story of Melita Norwood, a KGB source known as the “granny spy” when she was unmasked in the late 90s. Joan is a far more timid traitor, though, motivated less by a zeal for communism than a very British instinct for decency and fair play.Dench plays her brilliantly in old age, of course, coming the doddery innocent with the cops for as long as she can stand it. Cookson gives a fine account of herself in the earlier sequences, as the shy student seduced but not quite radicalised at Cambridge by Leo (Tom Hughes), a Russian Jew and a socialist fireband. The flashback scenes are repetitive though, with Joan stoutly resisting the lures of her “comrades”, followed by yet another montage and a useful newsreel or two to fill in the historical gaps. Leo is a shifty, cold lover, and a devoutly earnest commie, but a believable enough type. Too many of the other characters here are stock ones, though, photocopied from old newspapers, such as Sonya (Tereza Srbova), a glamorous but steely KGB operative who cavorts in Joan’s mink, or William (Freddie Gaminara), who glides from the JCR to the Foreign Office while concealing both his Soviet allegiance and his Indian boyfriend.The present-day scenes are largely confined to the police station: all fairly stodgy, except when Dench’s face flickers with the thrill of recalling her misdemeanour. Back in the past, the sludgy greys and browns of wartime Cambridge pall rapidly. A trip across the ocean to Canada offers nothing more than an indifferently drawn digital war fleet, and an icky escalation of Joan’s relationship with Max, her stammering boss at the atom bomb lab (Stephen Campbell Moore). This suppressed affair (he’s married, of course) leads to more pouting than passion, and although it sets the scene for the film’s well-signalled denouement, that is hardly an advantage. The ease with which Joan betrays her country is matched only by the ease with which she gets away with it for so long. Her get-out-of-jail-free plan is both sleazy and implausible.For a story in which millions of lives are at stake, Red Joan is maddeningly cosy. As the posh plotters clatter their teacups in front of the gas fire, the tension dissipates in this bland retelling, Red Joan’s arrest hardly seems worth the paperwork.•Red Joan was screening at the Toronto film festival, and is due for UK release in April 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e22ffa1e8a369fafa0369b9801e5231b3e89a4d0/1260_225_5033_3019/master/5033.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=286290798a9523a8f6e0acd69bd1e3c9","title":"viola davis regrets her role in the help","story":"Actor has said she felt the voices of the black maids in Oscar-nominated 2011 film were marginalisedViola Davis has expressed regret about her role in 2011 film The Help, apparently concurring with critics of its “white saviour” narrative. Davis played Aibileen Clark, one of two black maids in 1963 Mississippi whose stories are told by a young white woman (Emma Stone) in a book exposing the everyday racism they face.In an interview with the New York Times, Davis cited The Help as a role she regretted. “I just felt that at the end of the day that it wasn’t the voices of the maids that were heard,” she said. “I know Aibileen. I know Minny. They’re my grandma. They’re my mom. And I know that if you do a movie where the whole premise is, I want to know what it feels like to work for white people and to bring up children in 1963, I want to hear how you really feel about it. I never heard that in the course of the movie.”Davis qualified her criticism by saying that the experience of making the film in terms of friendships and collaborators was extremely positive.In the same interview, Davis spoke of the “responsibility of feeling like I am the great black female hope for women of colour”, describing it as “a real professional challenge”.“Being that role model and picking up that baton when you’re struggling in your own life has been difficult. Looking at the deficit and seeing that once you’re on top, you can either take the role of leadership or you can toss it in the garbage and say, ‘I’m just out to save myself.’ I choose to be the leader.”The Help, directed by Tate Taylor, earned much praise for its cast, and some censure for its plot. Reviewing for the , Xan Brooks described its moral universe as “rendered in bright cartoonish strokes”. He continued: “The Help is a broad southern melodrama that implicitly frames the push for racial equality as the tale of oppressed African-Americans who are given their voice by a lone white do-gooder.”Davis, who has won a Tony, an Emmy and an Oscar (for Fences), has been a passionate campaigner for both gender and race pay parity.Speaking earlier this year, she called out what she suggested was implicit prejudice in the entertainment industry.“I have a career that’s probably comparable to Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, Sigourney Weaver,” she told Tina Brown. “They had the same path as me, and yet I am nowhere near them. Not as far as money, not as far as job opportunities, nowhere close to it.“People say, ‘You’re a black Meryl Streep … We love you. There is no one like you’,” she explained. “OK, then if there’s no one like me, you think I’m that, you pay me what I’m worth.”Davis is currently picking up rave reviews for her role in Steve McQueen’s forthcoming film, Widows.

Fried in its own fat until crisp and golden, carnitas is certainly no health food, but as an occasional treat with a generous dollop of fresh salsa and wrapped in a warm tortilla, it takes some beating.The traditional cut is pork shoulder, known in the US as pork butt after the barrels it was once packed in. It’s sometimes sold with the bone in, which is fine for this dish (some cooks believe it adds extra flavour, though I don’t think it makes much difference), but the amount below is for boneless shoulder, so make sure you take account of this when ordering.1.5kg pork butt (see step 1)1.5 tsp fine saltJuice of 1 orange (optional)1-2 bay leaves (optional)Carnitas is a simple dish with very few ingredients, which stands or falls on its pork: it simply won’t work with lean meat. Try to source a well-fatted shoulder from a farm shop or good butcher – or take a tip from William Leigh of Mexican street food joint Killa Dilla, and add 500g pork belly and 500g pig cheek to 1kg of pork shoulder.Cut the meat into chunks about 5cm all round – you don’t need to get the ruler out, but if you cut them too small, they’ll break down into mush too large, and they’ll take ages to cook. Leave the skin on: it adds a deliciously gelatinous richness to the final dish, even if you don’t ultimately want to eat it (more fool you).Arrange the chunks in a wide, heavy-based pan big enough to hold them in one layer, and preferably a not-too-crowded one. Add the salt and just enough cold water to cover the meat. You can leave it at that, and many recipes do, but I also favour orange juice for sweetness, and the savoury flavour of bay.Other things cooks add at this point: a cinnamon stick, two or three cloves, a good pinch of cumin, a splash of lager, full-sugar cola, onion wedges, a few smashed garlic cloves, coriander stalks, split jalapeño peppers, a dash of dried oregano – all of which are no doubt delicious, but I don’t think the dish needs them. Trust me: the pork is delicious on its own.Bring the pan to a boil, then turn down the heat and leave it to simmer gently, until the pork is tender but not falling apart, and the water has all but evaporated: turn the chunks occasionally during this time, so they cook evenly. How long this takes depends on your pork, but expect one and-a-half to two and-a-half hours.Increase the heat slightly to encourage any large chunks of fat to render, then, once there’s a generous amount in the pan, turn the heat up to medium-high and fry the meat in its own lard, turning regularly, until golden and crisp in places. Be careful not to break it up too much in the process. Once the fat is rendered, you can refrigerate it, lard and all, and then reheat in a very hot pan)Salsa is the traditional accompaniment for carnitas. What you put in yours is up to you, but for a simple tomato salsa, finely chop three spring onions and two deseeded green jalapeño peppers, and mix with 500g roughly diced, ripe tomatoes and the juice of a lime. Stir in a fistful of chopped coriander and season to taste.Serve the carnitas topped with the salsa and wrapped in warm tortillas – just dry fry them for a minute or two on each side in a frying pan, or gently heat them through in the oven. Strictly speaking, carnitas need nothing else for perfection, but you might like to make a quick salad of finely sliced red cabbage and grated carrot, mixed with plenty of lime juice, salt, and coriander or mint leaves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd036ca1d135a6e78bf04ac3ca9fbf7f8e0688f2/0_161_3870_2322/master/3870.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe75f79742b495a894acb260dcd248e7","title":"england switzerland five things we learned","story":"Gareth Southgate can enjoy the winning feeling, Jack Butland needs to sharpen up but Danny Rose is in fine fettleA win is a win is a win, especially after three straight defeats. Understrength England were not discouraged by their scruffy first period and improved sufficiently to scrounge a victory and keep a clean sheet against a team that scored six goals in their last outing. And Marcus Rashford produced a crisp finish to plunder his second goal in two starts. Those facts can only improve morale and make for better reading in the history books.When the Football Association’s Twitter account revealed the lineups, Jordan Pickford seemed to have been attributed the power of bilocation, as he was listed both as a starter and a substitute. The mistake was quickly rectified but the actual starter, Jack Butland, also got off to a goofy start, tapping the ball into the path of Mario Gavranovic early on. Maybe he was nervous knowing that his distribution would be examined especially closely given that it is one of the reasons why Gareth Southgate prefers Pickford and maybe the Stoke man’s confidence has suffered from a start to the season in which he has conceded 11 goals in six league matches, following on from a season in which his team conceded the joint-highest number in the Premier League. Whatever, the shaky start did not enhance Butland’s claim for his country’s No 1 jersey. But at least he did not hide and continued trying to show his ability with his feet. In the 74th minute he made a good sortie from his box to sweep up as Albian Ajeti threatened to collect a pass over the top of England’s defence.With his first touch of the match Danny Rose donked the ball straight out of play as Fabian Delph looked on in bewilderment. But the Tottenham player explained his intentions and three minutes later, in a similar position, Rose exchanged a nifty one-two with Delph before racing down the wing and delivering a dangerous cross. From then he stood out as England’s most useful attacker from open play, so his performance was an excellent reaction to Luke Shaw’s good game against Spain. England have strong options at left wing-back and, although the Leicester crowd hollered their approval when Ben Chilwell was introduced, the youngster has a lot to do to get ahead of Rose and Shaw.The Tottenham player wore the armband on the occasion of his 35th cap but he convinced neither as a captain nor as a midfielder, especially in the first half. As the anchor of a central midfield trio in which the other two members, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Delph, were making their first starts of the season, Dier might have been expected to take the initiative and help his team adapt to the fact that Switzerland regularly outnumbered them in midfield because of Xherdan Shaqiri’s canny movement. But Dier did not get to grips with that in a first period in which he was bypassed, serving neither as an effective sentinel in front of the defence nor as a useful conduit of attacks. He improved in the second half – by being more dynamic and vocal, for starters – but he still looks too limited a player to have a long-term future in the England squad unless he adds a lot more to his game.Three of England’s starters at Leicester – Delph, Loftus-Cheek and Danny Welbeck – had not started a match for their clubs this season and it showed. None of them played particularly badly but nor did they do themselves justice. Their attitudes were commendable and their intentions always noble but they did not quite have the sharpness to make the impact that they hinted at. It is not right that a player as talented and young as Loftus-Cheek should look rusty when given opportunities like this. He will not keep getting them if he is not in a state to take them. If he does not start to play more regularly for Chelsea, he needs to move."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c26f18d73bb449320404d87fa814c129ca4e3ac5/0_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5d0dd6316e9f5e102bc56c81b029025","title":"hugo lloris drink drive twice limit","story":"Tottenham Hotspur’s World Cup-winning goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was “lucky” not to knock down pedestrians or damage cars when driving erratically at the end of an evening in which he was “showered with drinks” at a restaurant, a court has heard.The 31-year-old Frenchman caught police attention when he was spotted “veering” across Gloucester Place in central London in a new Porsche Panamera, doing 15mph in a 30mph zone, and going through a red light in the early hours of 24 August.Westminster magistrates’ court heard officers spotted vomit in the car, which was carrying an unnamed passenger, while Lloris, of East Finchley in north London, had to be helped from the vehicle. He pleaded guilty to being more than two times the legal drink-drive limit and was fined £50,000.Sentencing Lloris, magistrate Amanda Barron said the fine represented the seriousness of the offence as well as the goalkeeper’s financial means, although details of his salary were not disclosed in court. “This is a very serious offence, as you know,” she said. “Not only were you putting your own life at risk but also that of your passenger. It was pure luck that you did not cause damage to other vehicles or pedestrians in the central London area.”Outlining the case, prosecutor Henry Fitch said: “Shortly before 2.20am, officers were on patrol in an unmarked vehicle when their attention was drawn to a Porsche – it was moving strangely and doing 15mph in a 30mph zone. It veered a number of times towards parked vehicles, nearly clipping them, before correcting itself. It then went through a red light.”He said the officers saw there was a passenger in the front of the car and vomit nearby. Lloris was later “helped from the car”, and gave a sample containing 80 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit in England and Wales is 35mcg.Defence counsel David Sonn said Lloris had been dining with “two friends” at a restaurant. He had initially booked a taxi but it cancelled, prompting Lloris to drive – something described by Mr Sonn as “the first of a number of unwise decisions”. Without mentioning the name of the restaurant or Lloris’s two guests, Mr Sonn said the player and his friends “were showered with hospitality, given the circumstances, not just by the restaurant but by others there, who were sending drinks to them”.He added: “By 2am he was completely drunk. At that moment he should have left the vehicle where it was. But, as Mr Lloris pointed out to me, it is when you’re drunk you’re likely to make mistakes – that was to drive home.”Mr Sonn also acknowledged his client’s fall from grace after being arrested. He said: “On 15 July he was arguably the proudest man on the planet – having captained France to the World Cup victory. Just 40 days later, he was arrested. He experienced the indignity of being handcuffed and put in a police station overnight. The spectacular fall from grace is not lost on Mr Lloris.”Lloris, who wore a dark suit with no tie, spoke only to confirm his personal details and admit a charge of drink driving. He was fined £50,000, plus costs and a victim surcharge, and banned from driving for 20 months.The magistrate said the punishment acknowledged the seriousness of the offence and the aggravating circumstances of having a passenger in the car, but also his admission at the earliest stage, including his statement released to the press shortly after his arrest.Lloris, who made his way into the court building flanked by two members of his entourage, left the building without comment. His club, for whom Lloris has made more than 200 league appearances, also declined to comment.After sentencing, Joshua Harris, director of campaigns for charity Brake, said: “It is disappointing to see that someone who is a role model to many thousands of football fans has admitted breaking the law by drink-driving. We expect the captain of Tottenham Hotspur and his national team to be setting a good example, not flouting the law in such a manner. This kind of dangerous behaviour is selfish, illegal and puts lives at risk.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e2e4a7ea3cebd67044637dd86a3cc140fbdce1/0_1_3047_1829/master/3047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e80505016709f7b874547c5fe5b2242","title":"the nations league and wycombes marcus bean football weekly","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Andy Brassell and Wycombe midfielder Marcus Bean to discuss the home nations, Nicklas Bendtner’s latest scrape, Ryan Babel’s return and Adil Rami’s proposal misfireJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

The governing body of European football has identified a yawning gap in the market: there is simply not enough European football. To this end, it is planning to launch a third European club competition. According to the president of the European Clubs Association, Andrea Agnelli: “The current model needs modernising.”Naturally. I don’t know what is carved above the lintel at Uefa HQ, but assume it is whatever is the Latin for “If it ain’t broke, break it”. Or as Agnelli put it: “The green light has been given to introduce a third competition.” (On a side note, incredible to think since it is a full nine years since the ’s Fiver launched its groundbreaking Stop Football campaign, with all the attendant success you’d expect from that most beloved of tea-timely emails.)Tantalisingly, there are as yet no details of the form this battle minor-royale would take, other than Uefa’s implicit assumption that it would be another money gusher.

I expect that’s why so many petrochemical billionaires – and indeed petro-states – are drawn to it these days. Honestly, what’s the worst that can happen?Into Uefa’s vacuum, then, let us introduce the flammable gas of suggestion, with some ideas for the competition you didn’t know you needed. And, indeed, don’t need – but are no doubt getting anyway.Agnelli’s claim that Uefa wishes to modernise means there can be no return to its much-tolerated Cup-Winners’ Cup. However, there is nothing, absolutely nothing, stopping Uefa sating the deep need for a competition designed to determine who would beat whom out of the sides who lost cup finals – and this nine-month, leg-by-leg thrill ride promises to put you right inside the action. Sponsored by the European Central Bank.Assuming the Premier League does eventually sign up to a two-week winter break, this competition would work on the “a change is as good as a rest” principle. The break would consequently be used for more football, in the form of a high-intensity, low-prestige two-week knockout tournament between whichever sides are deemed least watchable by neutrals.Exactly the same as the Champions League, except with every player dressed as a giant vegetable.Likely to be swiftly nicknamed “the Euro Vars”, this serves as a sort of constructors’ championship for football, with all the soulful sporting magic the comparison suggests. Two remote video refereeing rooms play each other to get to a decision first, in a series of nail-biting, atmosphere-draining pauses. Amazon is set to buy all of the nine rights packages for a total of £1.2bn.A format that is at once as self-explanatory as it is inexplicable. In this case, the high concept would be to expand the offer of European football beyond the top flight’s top clubs, and the top flight’s middling clubs, and the top flight’s bottom clubs, all the way down to the best of the rest. In order to convey the requisite level of box office, the iconic Champions League anthem would be only slightly reworked, with the climactic chorus now running: “Die Meister of the Second Tier! Die Second Besten! Les Best-of-the-rest Equipes! The Championships!”Finding yourself dropping down out of the top league is no longer a bar to European football instead, it’s a way in. In this competition, getting relegated constitutes the start of a long and energy-sapping journey that could even hasten your trajectory towards the third tier. Still, worth it for the telly money, apparently.In this state-of-the-art tournament for the post-football era of football, leading European football managers play each other at Football Manager. ITV announces its first all-teen commentary team. Tim Lovejoy anchors.Believed to be the world’s first cup competition in which only one team (Arsenal) competes. Though Arsenal are likely to leave themselves with everything to do in the second leg, the eventual triumph should spare the nation 937 hours of angry radio phone-ins, 432 miles of portentous column inches, and 84 hectares of bedsheets.It is surely only a matter of time before the powers that be realise they have somehow failed to monetise the popular post-training pastime of so many of European football’s biggest names. The Uefa Open would be a series of Ryder Cup-style golf matches between Europe’s leading club sides. Actually, hang on: why not go the whole hog and pit Uefa against MLS? I think we should probably be ruling things in rather than out at this stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fa2623653949208d8e0c0b8e08d478667787449/359_0_5314_3190/master/5314.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cd370d4b228b41021d50841728a8d44","title":"how to stay fit for ever 25 tips keep exercising expert advice","story":"Can you carry on exercising when your motivation slips, the weather gets worse or your schedule becomes overwhelming? Experts and  readers give their best adviceWe all know we should be doing more, but how do we keep moving when our motivation slips, the weather takes a turn for the worse or life gets in the way? Try these 25 pieces of advice from experts and  readers to keep you going.Our reasons for beginning to exercise are fundamental to whether we will keep it up, says Michelle Segar, the director of the University of Michigan’s Sport, Health and Activity Research and Policy Center. Too often “society promotes exercise and fitness by hooking into short-term motivation, guilt and shame”. There is some evidence, she says, that younger people will go to the gym more if their reasons are appearance-based, but past our early 20s that doesn’t fuel motivation much. Nor do vague or future goals help (“I want to get fit, I want to lose weight”). Segar, the author of No Sweat: How the Simple Science of Motivation Can Bring You a Lifetime of Fitness, says we will be more successful if we focus on immediate positive feelings such as stress reduction, increased energy and making friends. “The only way we are going to prioritise time to exercise is if it is going to deliver some kind of benefit that is truly compelling and valuable to our daily life,” she says.The danger of the typical New Year resolutions approach to fitness, says personal trainer Matt Roberts, is that people “jump in and do everything – change their diet, start exercising, stop drinking and smoking – and within a couple of weeks they have lost motivation or got too tired. If you haven’t been in shape, it’s going to take time.” He likes the trend towards high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and recommends people include some, “but to do that every day will be too intense for most people”. Do it once (or twice, at most) a week, combined with slow jogs, swimming and fast walks – plus two or three rest days, at least for the first month. “That will give someone a chance of having recovery sessions alongside the high-intensity workouts.”It is helpful not to try to make yourself do things you actively dislike, says Segar, who advises thinking about the types of activities – roller-skating? Bike riding? – you liked as a child. But don’t feel you have to really enjoy exercise. “A lot of people who stick with exercise say: ‘I feel better when I do it.’” There are elements that probably will be enjoyable, though, such as the physical response of your body and the feeling of getting stronger, and the pleasure that comes with mastering a sport.“For many people, the obvious choices aren’t necessarily the ones they would enjoy,” says Sniehotta, who is also the director of the National Institute for Health Research’s policy research unit in behavioural science, “so they need to look outside them. It might be different sports or simple things, like sharing activities with other people.”Inidual motivation – or the lack of it – is only part of the bigger picture. Money, parenting demands or even where you live can all be stumbling blocks, says Sniehotta. Tiredness, depression, work stress or ill family members can all have an impact on physical activity. “If there is a lot of support around you, you will find it easier to maintain physical activity,” he points out. “If you live in certain parts of the country, you might be more comfortable doing outdoor physical activity than in others. To conclude that people who don’t get enough physical activity are just lacking motivation is problematic.”Segar suggests being realistic. “Skip the ideal of going to the gym five days a week. Be really analytical about work and family-related needs when starting, because if you set yourself up with goals that are too big, you will fail and you’ll feel like a failure. At the end of a week, I always ask my clients to reflect on what worked and what didn’t. Maybe fitting in a walk at lunch worked, but you didn’t have the energy after work to do it.”“If you need willpower to do something, you don’t really want to do it,” says Segar. Instead, think about exercise “in terms of why we’re doing it and what we want to get from physical activity. How can I benefit today? How do I feel when I move? How do I feel after I move?”Anything that allows you to exercise while ticking off other goals will help, says Sniehotta. “It provides you with more gratification, and the costs of not doing it are higher.” For instance, walking or cycling to work, or making friends by joining a sports club, or running with a friend. “Or the goal is to spend more time in the countryside, and running helps you do that.”Try to combine physical activity with something else. “For example, in my workplace I don’t use the lift and I try to reduce email, so when it’s possible I walk over to people,” says Sniehotta. “Over the course of the day, I walk to work, I move a lot in the building and I actually get about 15,000 steps. Try to make physical activity hit as many meaningful targets as you can.”When you take up running, it can be tiring just getting out of the door – where are your shoes? Your water bottle? What route are you going to take? After a while, points out Sniehottta, “there are no longer costs associated with the activity”. Doing physical activity regularly and planning for it “helps make it a sustainable behaviour”. Missing sessions doesn’t.What if you don’t have time to exercise? For many people, working two jobs or with extensive caring responsibilities, this can undoubtedly be true, but is it genuinely true for you? It might be a question of priorities, says Sniehotta. He recommends planning: “The first is ‘action planning’, where you plan where, when and how you are going to do it and you try to stick with it.” The second type is ‘coping planning’: “anticipating things that can get in the way and putting a plan into place for how to get motivated again”. Segar adds: “Most people don’t give themselves permission to prioritise self-care behaviours like exercise.”A workout doesn’t have to take an hour, says Roberts. “A well-structured 15-minute workout can be really effective if you really are pressed for time.” As for regular, longer sessions, he says: “You tell yourself you’re going to make time and change your schedule accordingly.”It rains for a week, you don’t go running once and then you feel guilty. “It’s a combination of emotion and lack of confidence that brings us to the point where, if people fail a few times, they think it’s a failure of the entire project,” says Sniehotta. Remember it’s possible to get back on track.If previous exercise regimes haven’t worked, don’t beat yourself up or try them again – just try something else, he says. “We tend to be in the mindset that if you can’t lose weight, you blame it on yourself. However, if you could change that to: ‘This method doesn’t work for me, let’s try something different,’ there is a chance it will be better for you and it prevents you having to blame yourself, which is not helpful.”“We start to lose muscle mass over the age of around 30,” says Hollie Grant, a personal training and pilates instructor, and the owner of PilatesPT. Resistance training (using body weight, such as press-ups, or equipment, such as resistance bands) is important, she says: “It is going to help keep muscle mass or at least slow down the loss. There needs to be some form of aerobic exercise, too, and we would also recommend people start adding balance challenges because our balance is affected as we get older.”“If you do 5k runs and you don’t know if you should push faster or go further, rate your exertion from one to 10,” says Grant. “As you see those numbers go down, that’s when to start pushing yourself a bit faster.” Roberts says that, with regular exercise, you should be seeing progress over a two-week period and pushing yourself if you feel it is getting easier. “You’re looking for a change in your speed or endurance or strength.”If you have caring responsibilities, Roberts says you can do a lot within a small area at home. “In a living room, it is easy to do a routine where you might alternate between doing a leg exercise and an arm exercise,” he says. “It’s called Peripheral Heart Action training. Doing six or eight exercises, this effect of going between the upper and lower body produces a pretty strong metabolism lift and cardiovascular workout.” Try squats, half press-ups, lunges, tricep dips and glute raises. “You’re raising your heart rate, working your muscles and having a good general workout.” These take no more than 15-20 minutes and only require a chair for the tricep dips – although dumbbells can be helpful, too.We are often told that housework and gardening can contribute to our weekly exercise targets, but is it that simple? “The measure really is you’re getting generally hot, out of breath, and you’re working at a level where, if you have a conversation with somebody while you’re doing it, you’re puffing a bit,” says Roberts. “With gardening, you’d have to be doing the heavier gardening – digging – not just weeding. If you’re walking the dog, you can make it into a genuine exercise session – run with the dog, or find a route that includes some hills.”Joslyn Thompson Rule, a personal trainer, says: “The general rule is if it’s above the neck – a headache or a cold – while being mindful of how you’re feeling, you are generally OK to do some sort of exercise. If it’s below the neck – if you’re having trouble breathing – rest. The key thing is to be sensible. If you were planning on doing a high-intensity workout, you would take the pace down, but sometimes just moving can make you feel better.” After recovering from an illness, she says, trust your instincts. “You don’t want to go straight back into training four times a week. You might want to do the same number of sessions but make them shorter, or do fewer.”Clearly, how quickly you start exercising again depends on the type of injury, and you should seek advice from your doctor. Psychologically, though, says Thompson Rule: “Even when we’re doing everything as we should, there are still dips in the road. It’s not going to be a linear progression of getting better.”For goal-oriented people, Grant says, it can be useful to monitor progress closely, but “allow some flexibility in your goals. You might have had a stressful day at work, go out for a run and not do it as quickly and then think: ‘I’m just not going to bother any more.’” However, “It can start to get a bit addictive, and then you don’t listen to your body and you’re more at risk of injury.” “Winter is not necessarily a time to hibernate,” says Thompson Rule. Be decisive, put your trainers by the door and try not to think about the colddrizzlegreyness. “It’s the same with going to the gym – it’s that voice in our head that make us feel like it’s a hassle, but once you’re there, you think: ‘Why was I procrastinating about that for so long?’”I’ve tried and failed a few times to establish a consistent running routine, but that was because I kept pushing myself too hard. Just because I can run for an hour doesn’t mean I should. Running two or three times a week for 20-30 minutes each time has improved my fitness hugely and made it easier to fit in. I keep a large bag of Midget Gems in my car to motivate myself to get to the gym, allowing myself a handful before a workout. Sometimes I toss in some wine gums for the element of surprise.I tapped into the vast network of fitness podcasts and online communities. On days I lacked drive, I would listen to a fitness podcast, and by the time I got home, I would be absolutely determined to make the right choices. In fact, I would be excited by it. Your brain responds very well to repetition and reinforcement, so once you have made the difficult initial change, it becomes much easier over time. I have kept a “star chart” on my calendar for the past two years, after having three years of being chronically unfit. I put a gold star on days that I exercise, and it’s a good visual motivator for when I am feeling slug-like. I run, use our home cross-trainer and do a ski fitness programme from an app. My improved core strength has helped my running and ability to carry my disabled child when needed.If, like me, you need to get up early to exercise or it just doesn’t happen, move your alarm clock away from your bed and next to your kit. Once you have got up to turn it off, you might as well keep going!I have one simple rule which could apply to any fitness activity – I do not allow more than four days to elapse between sessions. So, if I know I have a busy couple of days coming up, I make sure I run before them so that I have “banked” my four days. With the exception of illness, injury or family emergencies, I have stuck to this rule for 10 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cb42c2592fd3dbc5c5fbc1f9af8e102047dec93/100_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=aae05f272f82a7871480a9cb8da73714","title":"quarter of england and n ireland graduates in school leaver jobs","story":"Many graduates lack numeracy and literacy skills expected from degree, OECD boss saysOne in four graduates in England and Northern Ireland are working in jobs for which they are overqualified and do not require a degree, according to a major international education report.The study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development found that while graduate unemployment rates in the UK are among the lowest in the world, students are more likely to end up in non-graduate jobs associated with lower incomes.Andreas Schleicher, the OECD’s director of education and skills, said too many young people emerging from university were ending up in low-paid, non-graduate jobs in the UK because they lacked the basic numeracy and literacy skills that should be expected from a university education.Schleicher said: “What we see is that a lot of people in the UK get a university degree but end up in a job that does not require that degree. When you test the skills of those people you actually see that those people don’t have the kind of skills that would be associated with a university degree.”The OECD director was speaking at the London launch of the OECD’s annual Education at a Glance survey for 2018, which compares educational systems and attainment in countries around the world.Though the UK has succeeded in opening up access to universities, with more than half of young adults now going on to higher education, the report points out that tuition fees in England – which now stand at £9,250 a year – are higher than any other OECD country apart from the US.“We have no indication that the UK economy does not need more advanced skills. The question is more about, how can we ensure that every university degree gives young people the kind of skills that they have paid for.”Schleicher called on the government to provide greater quality assurance for students.“I do believe that a government that asks students to pay significant fees should also have a hard look at the quality of the services that are being provided to deliver for those students.”The education secretary, Damian Hinds, said the studyhighlighted the strengths of the UK education system, placing it among the top three countries for education spending as a proportion of gross domestic product. On universities, he said the UK offered some of the most generous support for students in OECD countries.“The result of this is that, as the report recognises, we have high levels of young people in education or employment, the financial gains from going to university outstrip the cost, and people are more likely to continue learning throughout their lives.”A separate piece of research, meanwhile, has suggested that a degree from a non-elite university may damage the job prospects of women from wealthy backgrounds who are less likely to find secure employment than if they have no degree at all.Researcher Maria Holcekova analysed survey data on 4,281 women in England from different socio-economic backgrounds to examine the effects of their educational qualifications on their careers.“Graduating from non-Russell Group university increases the probability of insecure employment, such as shift work or zero-hours contracts, compared to those without a degree,” said Holcekova."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7633dceccadb3fa848664897e8183cc266bc9ed6/0_33_4112_2467/master/4112.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30c090087bc82a264ecf7bc9bd96fd62","title":"guardian writers favourite kate bush lyrics book","story":"As Kate Bush announces a book of her collected lyrics,  writers pick out their favourite lines from across her careerI’ve got everything I needI’ve got petrol in the carI’ve got some money with meThere’s just one problemYou’re the only one I wantIt’s easy to overlook this breakup ballad. The album it’s taken from – The Red Shoes – contains Rubberband Girl and Why Should I Love You?, which brazenly combines Prince and Lenny Henry. But You’re the One, the album’s closer, takes a straightforward story of two people breaking up and turns it into the equal of Nothing Compares 2 U, when it comes to a big bombastic statement about heartbreak. The lyrics, which start with the strangely functional (“It’s alright, I’ll come round when you’re not in”) are the key to its success, as Bush slowly and tragically admits to being unable to function without her lover. Bush’s own long-term relationship with bassist Del Palmer had come to an end before the album was recorded, while her mother and guitarist Alan Murphy also died in the lead up to the album’s release. That loss is sprinkled all over the song but these lyrics,in an instant, capture how putting a brave face on things can’t outrun the pain of grief. Lanre BakareBut every time it rainsYou’re here in my headLike the sun coming outOoh, I just know that something good is gonna happenI first heard this during the lowest point of my life. I had recently graduated but – to misquote Morrissey – couldn’t get a job even if I wanted one my mother had just died and I lived alone in our childhood semi-detached council house on a diet of KitKats and baked beans. I was at my most miserable when I joined a mail order music service called the Britannia Music Club: signing up (however briefly) meant you got three free albums. There wasn’t a vast choice but I got Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s Greatest Hits, Prince’s Sign O’ the Times and Kate Bush’s Hounds of Love, and devoured each intensely. Cloudbusting – Hounds’ second single - is actually about the relationship between psychologistphilosopher Wilhelm Reich and his son, Peter, and in particular their time spent together making a rain-making machine – a Cloudbuster – but these lines spoke to me and offered a bright light at the end of a very dark tunnel.Each time I heard it, I instantly felt better: about myself, the future, everything. Gradually, I realised that the singer was singing about a father, whose memory lingered on, and I related to that too. My own father died when I was six, but one of my abiding memories of him is of how he left a new word for me every day on a blackboard before he went to work, which meant I could spell by the time I got to school. All this came together when an exasperated dole mate, Paul, said, “Look, all you’re interested in is music. Why don’t you write about music?” and a light bulb went on above my head. I clambered out of the tunnel, never to return. Thank you Dad, thank you – wherever you are – Paul, and thank you Kate. Dave SimpsonThis sense of humour of mineIt isn’t funny at allOh, but we sit up all nightTalking about itAside from being six minutes of gorgeous piano work backed by an orchestra, arranged by Michael Kamen, Bush’s Moments of Pleasure is among her lyrically strongest works thanks to its lightness of touch. Mostly inspired by the grief that came after multiple people close to her had died, there are vignettes of memory the titular moments of pleasure (“I think about us  lying on a beach somewhere”). But it’s this lyric that I go back to. I’d hate to say these lines stand out for me as someone who absolutely copes with the darkest of events using awkward jokes and black humour, much explored by frustrated therapists and partners, but, well … that is why. No idea if this is true, but I’ve heard the line was inspired by a technician who accidentally wiped a finished track from The Dreaming: “God, I couldn’t stop laughing”. You gotta laugh or you’ll cry, right? Hannah Jane ParkinsonWe let the weirdness inThe Dreaming isn’t Kate Bush’s best album, but it remains my favourite there’s something very beguiling about the sound of an artist finally letting their imagination fully run riot. Not that Kate Bush’s imagination was ever terribly constrained, but The Dreaming is marked by the sense that sampling technology had now enabled her to fully recreate the sounds in her head, and that she was now successful enough to please no-one other than herself. That’s what Leave It Open seems to be about: a confession that things hadn’t always been done the way she would have liked – “narrow mind would persecute it, die a little just to get to it” – and an announcement that they will be from now on. There’s something really moving about the way the lyrics make the listener complicit, drawing you in to her increasingly weird world: it’s not confrontational but trusting, it ends with a repeated invocation not of “I”, but “we let the weirdness in”. The pronoun seems important, as if she knows that anyone left after this is in it with her for the long haul. Alexis PetridisI stand outside this woman’s workThis woman’s worldOoh, it’s hard on the manThe idea of pregnancy being hard on the man … blimey, do we really want to go there? As someone who witnessed his tough cookie of a wife doubled up in agony while emitting sonorous groans and accusing her loving husband of conspiring with the midwives to deny her pain relief, I’m not sure now (or ever) is the time. Yet the partner’s experience of childbirth undeniably provides its own unique brand of torture – not least in the sheer powerlessness you feel. The act of watching biology whirl around you while you can do nothing but “pray God you can cope” and try not to let your tears show is something many men will have felt. I doubt any will ever express it as eloquently as Bush, though. Tim JonzeI should be crying, but I just can’t let it showI should be hoping, but I can’t stop thinkingOf all the things I should’ve said that I never saidAll the things we should’ve done though we never didFor me this song speaks of grief of finding out that life is not infinite, relationships don’t always last and at some point everything you’ve wanted to say to someone dissolves it’s too late, and time has moved on without you. It is a song that demands courage – to speak up, to stand up, to travel, to see everything and do everything because life has a way of disrupting plans. Of course it is a sad song, but sadness here is a driver – a way of moving forward and pushing for more. Jenny StevensThey say no, no it won’t last foreverAnd here I am again my girlWondering what on earth I am doing hereMaybe he doesn’t love meI just took a trip on my love for himI’m a strange kind of music fan: I don’t really notice lyrics. There are songs that make my heart swell and glow, but I can only pick out odd words, or quote just the occasional line that floats to the surface. Maybe that’s why Kate Bush’s The Man With the Child in His Eyes is the track I think of now. Piano, cello and voice, barely three minutes long, with whispered lines that seem to come from a half-remembered dream, it’s so simple and direct it felt like something I’d always known.Bush wrote this song at 14 or 15, and recorded it at 16, the age I too was spinning secret dreams of being cherished and simply understood in the way her lyrics spoke of. Its absence of cynicism makes it a song that could only be written by a young teenager, from its anxious intensity as it lurches from declarations of eternal love to, “Maybe he doesn’t love me”, and its us-against-the-world story: “They say no, no, it won’t last”. I yearned for someone to tell me about the sea. All the boys I knew just had bad hair, spots and made stupid jokes about the size of your breasts. And, to misquote another great work of art that sustained my teenage years, The Princess Bride, this wasn’t a song about kissing (yuck), this was about something deeper, purer. I wonder if I was also obliquely glimpsing the pain and vulnerability I saw but could not directly acknowledge in my father, as my parents’ marriage broke up that same year. Bush’s songs soundtracked that period of my life, which is why today The Man With the Child in His Eyes makes me think of my father, which is why I still cherish it. Imogen TildenMy mother And her little brown jugIt held her milkThe power of Bush’s lyrics is often found in the way she telescopes between fantastical visions and intimate detail, and this is a perfect example. Coming at the end of disc one of 2005 double album Aerial – a series of character studies including Elvis, Joan of Arc and her son – is this song about Bush’s mother. It begins with a weird reverie, seeing a cityscape and even a battlefield in a bunch of fishing paraphernalia, but just as Bush gets carried off by her daydream, it’s as if something triggers a long-forgotten memory. The world contracts to a room. Like all our most powerful memories, it is an incredibly simple image, and yet so redolent of nursing and nurture. This is one of the most intensely poignant moments in Bush’s catalogue, all the more so for how the clarity of the memory is crowded out by her reverie rushing back in again. Reminiscent of Eliot’s “Marie, Marie, hold on tight. And down we went” from The Waste Land, it is one of those moments in life where you’re transported back to childhood, all our experience and language collapsing into innocence and need. With this song, Bush makes children of us all. Ben Beaumont-ThomasHello, I know that you’ve been feeling tiredI bring you love and deeper understandingHello, I know that you’re unhappyI bring you love and deeper understandingBush wrote Deeper Understanding before I was even born, and a decade before MSN Messenger and LiveJournal turned after-school hours into opportunities to share your darkest secrets with strangers you only knew by their asl. And yet, despite coming from a more primitive time – the internet newly born as a niche concern – it is the most empathetic and accurate song I’ve ever heard about the relationship between humans and computers. (Ever wise, Bush also predicted the addictive nature of playing the Sims: “Nothing else seemed to matter  I neglected my bodily needs.”)It’s a hard balance to strike – the past five years or so have spawned countless songs about that bond, many of them preachy or facile. There is no judgment in Bush’s beautiful song: the user’s family may intervene, but still, they’re lonely and lost.

The United Kingdom will always be a very close neighbour and partner in political, economic and security terms.”However, his tone was generally gloomy and he issued warnings over a no-deal exit and the Irish border issue, which has proved to be the biggest obstacle to an agreement.Juncker said the EU would not let Ireland down in negotiations to avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland. The UK agreed last December and in March this year to sign up to a “backstop” solution to prevent such a border emerging in any scenario after Brexit, but the government has ruled out EU proposals that in effect would keep Northern Ireland in the single market and customs union, and it is yet to offer a workable alternative, according to Brussels.Noisiest in their opposition are Tory Brexiters, not least David Davis and Boris Johnson, both of whom quit the cabinet in protest. They argue that the promise to maintain a common rulebook for goods and other continued alignment will mean a post-Brexit UK is tied to the EU without having a say on future rules, rather than being a free-trading independent nation.Labour has also disparaged the proposal, expressing deep scepticism about the so-called facilitated customs arrangement system.Brussels has sought to stay positive, but has deep concerns about elements of the plan viewed as overly pick-and-mix, and thus potentially incompatible with EU principles.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, says he opposes both the customs plan and the idea of alignment for goods. He also makes plain his contention that the Chequers plan contains no workable idea for the Ireland-Northern Ireland border.But at the same time the EU has been careful to not entirely dismiss the proposals, raising the possibility it could accept some adapted version.Officially, May and her cabinet, though even here the backing can seem lukewarm at times. Asked about Chequers, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, said it was the government’s plan “right now”, indicating alternative ideas could be considered.Even May’s allies concede it will be a hugely difficult task to get the plan through parliament. Damian Green, the PM’s close friend and former de fact deputy, described the process as “walking a narrow path with people chucking rocks at us from both sides”.On the remain side of the Conservatives, the former education secretary Justine Greening called the Chequers plan “more unpopular than the poll tax”, saying May should start again from scratch.If anything can save the plan – and it’s an outside shot – it will be a combination of the hugely tight timetable and the fact that, as yet, no one else has yet produced a plan with a better chance of being accepted by parliament.On 20 September, an informal gathering in Salzburg, Austria, will provide a snapshot of current EU thinking. Then, 10 days later, the Conservative conference could show the Chequers plan is holed below the waterline.If it survives these tests, the proposals will then reach the crucial EU summit Brussels on 18 October, with something final needed, at the very latest, in the next two months. PETER WALKERUrging the UK to live up to the commitments it had made, Juncker said: “The European commission, this parliament and all other 26 member states will always show loyalty and solidarity with Ireland when it comes to the Irish border.“This is why we want to find a creative solution that prevents a hard border in Northern Ireland … It is not the European Union, it is Brexit that risks making the border more visible in Northern Ireland.”May told the Commons on Wednesday she believed Juncker’s comments were positive. “I note that President Juncker said that the UK ‘will\u0026nbspnever be an ordinary third country’,” she said. “Let me be very clear, when we leave the EU we will be an independent sovereign nation with control of our money, laws and our borders. I want to say to our closest allies in Europe, you will also never be an ordinary third party for us,” she said.\u0026nbspMay also said the government would not accept a situation of a so-called “blind Brexit” where the UK agrees a withdrawal arrangement in March alongside a vaguer statement of intent for the future relationship to be thrashed out over the transition period.According to a commission release of the speech, Juncker had been due to issue a warning to May that the EU would be “very outspoken should the British government walk away from its responsibilities under the Good Friday agreement”, the Northern Ireland peace treaty. In the event, he did not make the threat.Juncker did, however, scorn claims from the British government that it would go it alone and build its own satellite if the EU did not allow UK industry and its military to have continued access to the bloc’s Galileo programme after Brexit.“It is our Galileo programme that is today keeping Europe in the space race. No single member state could have put 26 satellites in orbit, for the benefit of 400 million users worldwide. No single member state could have done this alone,” he said. The UK government has contributed over £1.2bn to the Galileo satellite navigation system, which is intended to rival the US-controlled global positioning system. Once fully operational in 2020 it will provide accurate position, navigation and timing information to be used by governments, citizens, industry and the military.The EU has ruled out the continued involvement of the British space industry after Brexit as it is a benefit reserved for member states.Elsewhere in his speech, Juncker unveiled plans to strengthen the EU’s coastguard and asylum agency to police Europe’s outside borders and speed the deportation of migrants illegally staying in the EU.A standing corps of 10,000 staff, including guards and migration experts, is expected to be up and running by 2020, and they would be given powers to check ID papers and stamp travel documents, detain people who are crossing the border without authorisation, and help ensure those not eligible are deported."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bda4cbce47662488529469320ef9cb41257d1676/11_0_1690_1014/master/1690.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db577e66a3a348c9b0180f3d23b95a0a","title":"pmqs verdict corbyn nails it with focus on universal credit","story":"Labour leader wins parliamentary set-piece comfortably with peroration that was perhaps one of his bestTheresa May and Jeremy Corbyn start PMQs by congratulating cricketer Alastair Cook on his long career.Corbyn asks May what the National Farmers’ Union, the Federation of Small Businesses, the National Audit Office, the charity Gingerbread and the Royal Society of Arts have in common? May replies, saying they all give good service and are bodies to which the government listens. Corbyn agrees, but adds they are also telling the government universal credit is flawed and failing hundreds of thousands of people. Corbyn asks if May stands by a government statement that universal credit would lift 350,000 children out of poverty.May says universal credit was introduced because of the failures left by Labour.Corbyn continues with universal credit and says constituency MPs know the pain it is causing by creating hardship, and forcing people to use food banks. He says the National Audit Office said this could end up costing the state more.May responds with a constituency case she remembers when a single mother came to see her when Labour was in office who wanted to work but was told she would be better off on benefits.Corbyn says he asked about the NAO and says the Trussell Trust says food bank usage is four times higher in areas where the new benefit has been rolled out. He wants to know if the government will ensure people retain the support they need.May says the government knows work is the best route of out poverty and asks why, if Corbyn thinks universal credit should be changed, Labour voted against the changes?Corbyn moves on to Brexit. He says the government’s Brexit negotiations are an “abject failure”. He says he can see that from the look on Tory MPs faces – not just the pro-hard Brexit European Research Group lot, but all of them. He says May is not challenging the burning injustices in society, but pouring petrol on the crisis. When will she stop inflicting misery on people?May responds saying she set up the racial disparities unit. She said no one should be stopped and searched because of the colour of their skin. She says there are 3.3 million more people in jobs. She finishes by asking what have we seen from Labour? Iranian state TV broadcasting a no-confidence motion in a Labour MP. And, “most shamefully of all”, Chuka Umunna saying Labour is now institutionally racist. That is what Corbyn has done for Labour just think what he would do for this country.Corbyn nailed it. Despite the challenges posed by facing a PM so obviously on the ropes, he won comfortably, with a peroration that was perhaps one of his best.In fact, what probably helped a lot was his decision not to try to make mischief with the latest ERG anti-May plotting. (For obvious reasons, backbench opposition to the leadership is not particularly a good topic for Corbyn.)Instead he focused on universal credit – one of several areas where the government’s public service delivery record is very poor, but where Brexit has led to this receiving less attention than it deserves.Unusually, but successfully, Corbyn started with a gentle, trick question. After that he piled in with a textbook display of evidence-based questioning, challenging May with robust and serious questions about universal credit and, towards the end, its impact on those currently on disability benefits who are due to migrate to universal credit.In the circumstances, May put up a pretty spirited defence. She could not really address Corbyn’s questions about whether universal credit was exacerbating poverty (because so many experts say it is), but she was entitled to say that the benefits system under Labour was not perfect and, interestingly, she tried the Corbyn tactic of using first-person stories to defend universal credit. But one anecdote from Roberta cannot counter a stack of statistical evidence from expert organisations.May responded to Corbyn’s peroration with a half-decent one of her own, although it was very telling that, when she is looking for examples of things she has done to promote social justice, she chose to focus particularly on her time as home secretary and her reforms to stop and search. She has been PM for more than two years now. Is there really nothing better she can cite from her prime ministerial CV?Jeremy Corbyn on the government’s failings:The prime minister is not challenging the burning injustices in our society, she’s pouring petrol on the crisis.

It was not a question of ‘should do’,” they said.After a feverish night of mounting dissent in Westminster, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, called for calm. “The critical thing is we need to make sure there is unity in the Conservative party behind the prime minister,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday.Noisiest in their opposition are Tory Brexiters, not least David Davis and Boris Johnson, both of whom quit the cabinet in protest. They argue that the promise to maintain a common rulebook for goods and other continued alignment will mean a post-Brexit UK is tied to the EU without having a say on future rules, rather than being a free-trading independent nation.Labour has also disparaged the proposal, expressing deep scepticism about the so-called facilitated customs arrangement system.Brussels has sought to stay positive, but has deep concerns about elements of the plan viewed as overly pick-and-mix, and thus potentially incompatible with EU principles.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, says he opposes both the customs plan and the idea of alignment for goods.

PETER WALKER“This is loose talk and the critical thing is we deliver on the Brexit mandate, and any ersion or distraction from that commitment means our ability to ensure that it is delivered is undermined.”At the meeting, sources said it was younger MPs who did the bulk of the talking, and veterans of the Eurosceptic movement, including Bill Cash, Iain Duncan Smith and Bernard Jenkin, were not present.“Possibly one of them would have formally decried open leadership talk if they had been present,” the source said.A confidence vote would require 48 MPs to send letters of no confidence to Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories.However, May would need only a simple majority to see off a challenge and Downing Street is confident Conservative rebels do not have the numbers to topple her. If she defeated a no-confidence vote, the prime minister could not be challenged again for another year.No 10 hosted sceptical Tory MPs on Tuesday night for a dinner with May’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, and director of communications, Robbie Gibb. Guests included the fierce critics John Baron and Andrew Bridgen, who has publicly declared that he has submitted his letter of no confidence in the prime minister.Speaking to ITV outside Downing Street, Baron said the MPs had discussed “leadership issues”. Asked whose leadership was under discussion, Baron said: “You guess.”Bridgen said he too had raised the issue of May’s leadership. “I’m told she will get a full appraisal of comments that were made at the dinner. I hope the prime minister will take on board what she’s heard and chuck Chequers, and we can move to the super Canada free-trade deal that would best serve our exit from the European Union,” he said.The former Brexit minister Steve Baker, a key member of the anti-Chequers campaign, has claimed 80 Tory MPs would vote against the prime minister’s plan, but said they were not trying to force a “no deal” outcome. “We are all agreed it would be preferable to leave smoothly into an agreement,” he said.May is holding a no-deal cabinet meeting on Thursday at which ministers will discuss plans in the event of the government failing to reach an agreement with Brussels.The prime minister has challenged Brexiters to publish their alternative plan, but ERG members appear to have struggled to agree on how to avoid a hard border in Ireland, a main sticking point in discussions with Brussels.A plan to brief journalists about a proposed solution to the Northern Irish border was pulled on Tuesday and is now expected on Wednesday. The group’s chairman, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said it was a plan that “any reasonable person” would accept and could include tax inspectors conducting spot checks in factories on goods for export."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86feda6d026d62326ca17a04f942c67acc7c8ce3/0_40_3150_1890/master/3150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5985aea6491e978c2b8d39815fd0769d","title":"tory brexiter group publishes plan for checks away from irish border","story":"European Research Group reveals plan for customs checks away from border Theresa May has failed to challenge the position taken by the EU on the Irish border, allowing it to become “a decisive factor” in the Brexit negotiations, according to the hard Brexit European Research Group, which has been discussing whether to attempt to unseat the prime minister.A position paper on the future of the Irish border, presented by David Davis and a string of Tories hostile to May’s Chequers plan, concedes that the UK will have to sign up to “equivalence of UK and EU regulations” for food products and standards.But it claims it will be possible to do that by the UK and EU maintaining a system of customs checks away from the border. The paper says: “Repetitive trade is well suited to established technical solutions and simplified customs procedures already available.”Two former Northern Ireland secretaries, Owen Paterson and Theresa Villiers, were due to speak at the launch event in a further sign that the ERG rebellion against May is hardening into a group openly defying the prime minister’s authority.Noisiest in their opposition are Tory Brexiters, not least David Davis and Boris Johnson, both of whom quit the cabinet in protest.

PETER WALKERAlso on the podium were the chair of the ERG, Jacob Rees-Mogg, and the former Northern Ireland first minister David Trimble.Rees-Mogg said the ERG’s goal was not to challenge May but to force her to ditch the Chequers plan. “I have long said and repeated that policy needs to be changed, but I’m supporting the person,” he said. May was a “fantastic and dutiful” prime minister and she “has my support”.The report accuses the EU of ignoring unionist opinion in Northern Ireland in negotiations on the Irish border question. “It is now accepted that the European commission has made a major error in taking advice on matters relating to the island of Ireland almost solely from Dublin. It must seek to learn more from respected voices in Northern Ireland,” the report says.The deputy leader of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party, Nigel Dodds, praised the ERG paper, tweeting:Earlier the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said the EU would always show “loyalty and solidarity” with the Republic of Ireland on the issue of its border with Northern Ireland. Delivering his state of the union speech, Juncker said: “We will defend all the elements of the Good Friday agreement. It is Brexit that risks making the border more visible in Northern Ireland. It is not the European Union.”On Tuesday Downing Street reiterated that Chequers was “the only serious, credible and negotiable plan which is on the table which both delivers on the will of the British people and which prevents the imposition of a hard border in Northern Ireland”.The ERG paper says larger companies could use “trusted trader” schemes to clear their goods for export and import, and other declarations could be incorporated into the existing system used for VAT returns.“The EU will be able to maintain the integrity of its internal market without erecting a hard border along its border with Northern Ireland,” it says. “At the same time, the United Kingdom will be able to develop a fully independent trade policy rather than remaining a rule-taker. The one element of ‘alignment’ necessary is the maintenance of the current common biosecurity zone covering the island of Ireland, and this is not contentious.“The necessary procedures described can all be implemented within the existing legal and operational frameworks of the EU and the UK, based on the mutual trust on which regular trade depends.“Rational, pragmatic approaches can ensure that the vital trade across the border is maintained. At the same time, this allows the United Kingdom to conduct an independent trade policy without threatening the integrity of the EU single market.”The group said its proposals could be delivered without the need for any new infrastructure at the border and without weakening north-south cooperation. “There is nothing which would reduce our commitment to the Belfast agreement or which might jeopardise peace in Northern Ireland,” it said.Seamus Lehany, of the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland, welcomed the creation of a common biosecurity zone. “It does have merit and makes logistical sense” but said it relied on checks being done when “wheels aren’t turning on lorries” moving the freight, either during shipping or at ports.\u0026nbspNiall MacSuibhne, a former senior official in Irish Revenue praised the ERG for going into detail on VAT, a complex issue but one that could sow the seeds of a huge black economy in the border.\u0026nbspIf chancellor Phillip Hammond drops VAT in Northern Ireland “smuggling will become every day occurance”, says MacSuibhne, citing the example of a builder in Donegal who goes across the border to buy all his supplies.\u0026nbsp“The problem is when people buy goods without records, this just leads to a bigger and bigger black economy.\u0026nbsp“At least the ERG are thinking about this issue but they have ignored all these small\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsptraders and householders and assume that everyone is a legitimate business.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b44e70b853fe295bdc8675bc74a9be21c1f048e8/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=079f82e06405eb32e20c9f10dbe4f380","title":"the feline timeline a history of cats from ancient egypt to instagram","story":"Celebrated and persecuted in equal measure, cats have been with us since the dawn of civilisation, featuring in verse, literature and film. Kate Wills explains why cat history is our historyThere is a saying that “nobody owns a cat”, but archaeological remains suggest that wildcats have been slinking inside huts for treats and strokes for around 9,000 years. Scientists recently discovered that all of today’s domestic cats descend from one subspecies of African wildcat, and that our ancestors could be ided into cat or dog people as early as the stone age.Perhaps the ultimate “cat people” were the Egyptians, who worshipped our feline friends to such an extent that they imposed the death penalty for killing one, shaved their eyebrows in grief when theirs died, and had them mummified and placed in purr-amids in readiness for the kitty afterlife. For ancient Romans, Felis silvestris catus was a symbol of liberty and an effective form of pest control. It was cats’ mice-bothering skills that allowed them to pad across Asia, where dedicated mousers protected silkworm cocoons and treasured manuscripts from rodents.The middle ages were a bit of a low period in the history of catkind, as felines were cast as symbols of “sinful” female sexuality and witchcraft by the church. In Malleus Maleficarum, the medieval treatise on witchcraft usually translated as The Witch Hammer, a 13th-century folk story depicts three witches that turn themselves into cats and attack a man. From then on witches were believed to have cats as sidekicks, or to change into feline form in the night. But by the 15th century, cats were coming back into favour, helped in part by the legend of Dick Whittington, who made his fortune thanks to his rat-killing kitty. This kitty may or may not have worn boots in real life – and may or may not have sounded like Antonio Banderas.It was around this time that cat-fans started breeding moggies for particular coat colours and textures. Kitty genetics is a fascinating field. Cats come in two dominant colours – black and red – that are “diluted” or “masked” to become “blue” (appearing grey) or “cream”. The red colour is only carried on the X chromosome, which is why tortoiseshell cats are nearly always female, and ginger cats are nearly always male. (This is all great trivia with which to impress your cat-loving andor geneticist friends, by the way.)There have been many “crazy cat ladies” – and gentlemen, for that matter – throughout history, notably Cardinal Richelieu (AKA the baddie in The Three Musketeers), who had 14 cats at the time of his death in 1642, including Ludovic le Cruel, so named because of his savage dedication to killing rats. Catherine the Great of Russia turned the Winter Palace into a cattery, with her favoured breed of Russian blues running wild upstairs and a basement full of “working cats” that she promoted to guard status, complete with salaries and extra food rations. Winston Churchill kept cats at Chartwell, while Abraham Lincoln was such a cat obsessive that he fed his kittens Tabby and Dixy at the table at a state dinner, and regularly took in strays to the White House.As cats became a popular indoor pet – no doubt helped by the invention of cat litter in 1947 – they clawed their way into popular culture, too. Whole essays have been written on the cartoon cat, from Sylvester the Cat, who first appeared in 1939, right up to Pokémon’s Meowth, via Felix, Top Cat, Garfield, Bagpuss and the Aristocats. Not to forget Alice’s Cheshire Cat, which also appeared in cartoon form in the 1951 Disney film.In a nod to the feline’s medieval association with evil, cats also became the purr-fect accomplice for witches, Bond villains and, in homage, Mike Myers’s Dr Evil. They were also the animal ally of choice for breakfasters at Tiffany’s, the alien-battling Ripley in the otherwise very non-furry Alien films, and leather-loving Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman herself in Batman Returns.But it’s the internet that has taken cats from much-loved pet to feline overlord. From “I can has cheezburger” memes to Grumpy Cat, via the 52 million people who have watched a ginger cat called Fatso play a keyboard, Brits share 3.8m cat pictures and videos every day. Meanwhile, social media has made stars of some pampered pusses, such as Karl Lagerfeld’s fluffy white Birman, Choupette (112.4k followers), Kitty Purry (Katy Perry’s cat) and Taylor Swift’s two cats, who now have their own merchandise line, the Meredith and Olivia Swift collection.But before memes there was poetry. In the ninth century, an Irish monk wrote a poem about his cat, Pangur Bán. For Baudelaire, the cat’s meow was the very source of his verse. When Romantic poet Robert Southey’s cat, Rumpelstiltskin, finally went for his great catnap in the sky, Southey wrote: “There should be a court mourning in Catland.” Meanwhile, Thomas Gray was composing an Ode on the Death of a Favourite Cat Drowned in a Tub of Goldfishes. If only they’d been alive in 2002, when the first cloned kitten – the aptly named “CC” – was born.And while Kristen Roupenian’s viral New Yorker short story Cat Person could stake a claim, the most famous feline work of literature has to be TS Eliot’s Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats. Fitting, then, that Andrew Lloyd Webber’s record-breaking 1981 musical version is about to get a big screen reboot, starring – who else? – contemporary cat woman Taylor Swift.

Gentle grooming and recall training can start now too, use treats to encourage them to respond to their name when called, or use a clicker just before you feed them so they associate that with reward.FeedingWeaned kittens do not need any kind of cat or kitten milk, but they do need a good quality protein-rich food. “Kittens have immature digestive systems and so need an easily digestible food, and once they have stopped feeding from their mother they need to build up their own immunity, so food must have the right nutrients, such as an antioxidant complex, to help bridge the gap while they are developing their own systems,” explains Hannah Poile, scientific communications manager at Royal Canin.Kittens go from sucking, to licking to crunching a kibble, so food that is hydratable is desirable. “A growth formula with calcium and phosphorous in the right levels to promote skeletal growth is also best for them at this stage,” says Poile.Between three and six months your kitten is headed towards sexual maturity, so it’s best to have your kitty neutered (and microchipped). Liaise with your vet around exact timings. After neutering it’s best to change to a specific neutered kitten diet, this will ensure they’re still getting all the nutrients they need for healthy growth, but will take into account the specific needs following this procedure.Your kitten should be fully grown by 12 months, unless it is a larger breed such as a Maine coon, which may not reach its adult size until around 15 months. During this phase – you could refer to it as the equivalent of teenage years in humans – your cat will become more demanding of both their owner and the world they live in. Keep them entertained by making sure there is plenty to stimulate them mentally and physically.Continue with grooming and introduce ear and teeth checks, perhaps follow this up with attention and affection rather than treats to prevent any issues with weight.FeedingAn appropriate older kitten food that will give the right level of nutrition for this second growth phase is best, along with food that specifically promotes balance in their intestinal flora is also recommended.This is prime time for your cat: they should be physically fit and well, with a glossy coat, bright eyes and plenty of get up and go. They will be hunting regularly (if they have access to outside spaces) or play hunting if an indoor cat.At this stage, your cat will respond well to games, so keep their toys varied and available, especially for indoor cats keep their weight monitored, teeth clean and stay up to date with worming, flea treatments and annual boosters.FeedingAged 12 months it’s time to transition your cat from kitten to adult food. “Make sure you are feeding it an activity-appropriate diet. Are they an indoor or an outdoor cat?” says Poile. “Indoor cats are generally less active and, if not fed a diet with the right level of calories, can easily gain weight.”“Naturally, cats eat little and often – they are grazers and will have up to 15 sittings a day. If you are supporting the species as it would eat naturally you would have food down for them so they can go back to it when they want it, activity feeders are great for encouraging natural feeding habits.”By the age of seven your cat will start to experience the early and often invisible changes that come with ageing. They may be more prone to weight gain, dental problems and joint issues. Help by making sure they keep active through play and monitor any changes in their coat, behaviour or feeding pattern. Encourage activity with a variety of mixed toys. Make sure they have to work a bit to get their food – they enjoy seeking it out.FeedingHelp to support your cat as they start to face the first signs of ageing with a diet adapted to this life stage containing targeted nutrients, such as vitamins and green tea polyphenols, to help maintain their vitality. Don’t forget to keep checking your cat’s body condition score and adapt their feeding amounts to keep them at a healthy bodyweight.At this age, your cat is likely to start to experience age-related health issues such as joint pain, a reduction in kidney function, weight loss and a decline in activity. They can also become fussy about food and may be less able to adapt to changes in their environment, so it’s best not to introduce any major changes to their routine or domestic life. Your cat may begin to show signs of cognitive dysfunction towards the older end of this life stage, monitor their behaviour for signs of confusion, which should be discussed with your vet.Feeding“A senior diet is very important for this age group,” says Poile. “Just as with kittens, older cats need food that supports their changing appetites, many older cats become fussier about their diet and may appreciate an adapted kibble or wet food. Kidney health is also a concern as cats age and it is important for regular checkups at the vet, as well as to feed a diet with an adapted level of phosphorous.”The elderly cat can struggle with regulating body temperature and have fairly extensive dental issues – oral disease or tooth loss can make eating difficult. So, it’s important to provide a palatable and digestible diet.Your cat may lose weight for no obvious reason, monitor their condition, coat and overall behaviour. Any concerns should be raised with your vet. They may struggle to groom regularly as they become less flexible, so maintain regular grooming sessions with them.Your cat is likely to sleep more and can be prone to senile changes. They can seem to be lost, unable to find their food or water or usual sleeping place, so be there to care for them.FeedingAs cats age, their bodies are less able to process and get nutrients from their food, so weight loss can occur. Be sure to feed them an age-appropriate food that has a high palatability and increased calorie content. Older cats can have issues with their sense of smell so a food with a rich aroma can help.All kittens should be fed according to the size they will become as an adult cat.

Since the “X” stands for 10, rather than the letter in Apple’s official naming, an XS would mirror similar “S” phones such as the iPhone 4S, 5S and 6S, rather than standing for iPhone “extra small” or “excess”.In the past such “S” iPhones have typically had improved internal components, but maintained a similar design and feature set to the iPhone model they replaced. The iPhone 4S introduced Siri, the iPhone 5S introduced Touch ID and the iPhone 6S 3D touch.The new iPhone X iteration is also expected to be joined by a larger version, possibly called the iPhone XS Max rather than “Plus”, “Pro” or other monikers as used in previous bigger versions such last year’s iPhone 8 Plus. The new larger iPhone X-like phone is expected to be more expensive than the starting price of £999 of 2017’s iPhone X, further stretching the expense of top-end smartphones.According to reports, Apple will also launch a cheaper version of the iPhone X design, unifying the entire 2018 iPhone line with the notched screen and Face ID facial recognition, dropping the Touch ID fingerprint scanner and home button.Apple has not launched a cheaper version of its iPhone since 2013’s iPhone 5C, which took the guts of the previous generation iPhone 5 and placed them in a coloured plastic body.Alongside the new iPhones, Apple is also expected to launch a new iteration of its smartwatch. The new Apple Watch is expected to have a similar design to the current Apple Watch 3, but potentially with a slightly larger screen squeezed into the same size body, according to reports.The Apple Watch has been a slow burn for the company, but has steadily grown in sales becoming a small but important part of Apple’s sales shipping 3.5m devices in Q2 2018 according to data from Canalys, but still dwarfed by the 41m iPhones shipped in the same time period.Although less likely, Apple may also launch new versions of its iPad Pro range. The company recently released a cheaper version of the iPad in March for £319, and before that a refreshed second-generation version of iPad Pro in June last year.But Apple’s tablets have struggled to convince buyers to upgrade in significant numbers, leaving the line to plateaux around the 9-13m units shipped a quarter over the last two years, down from the heady highs of 26m in the first quarter of 2014.Any new iPad Pro is expected to reflect the change in design language introduced with the iPhone X last year, dumping the long-standing home button and Touch ID for gestures and Face ID.The iPad has long had gestures that could in most cases replace the need for the home button, in switching between apps and getting to the home screen, so the full adoption of gestures over buttons seems logical. What remains to be seen is whether facial recognition can work as well on a tablet with its multiple orientations as it does on the iPhone X, which is primarily used when held in portrait orientation in the hand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57178115f756becacabd3ab0431710c264ef2537/0_296_2126_1276/master/2126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=faa9a808ece60382f13365a28c3e3e1c","title":"russias answer to james bond did he trigger putins rise to power seventeen moments spring","story":"He was a brooding spy whose adventures gripped 80 million viewers every night – including Brezhnev himself. But did Max Otto von Stierlitz also inspire Putin?On 11 August 1973, a TV series was premiered throughout the Soviet Union that stopped the people in their tracks. Seventeen Moments of Spring was broadcast at 7.30pm over 12 consecutive nights, and this black-and-white second world war spy drama amassed an astonishing 50 to 80 million viewers per episode.For the 70 minutes of each show, city streets emptied, power station output surged and crime halted. Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet leader, apparently changed the time of Central Committee meetings in order to catch every episode, so addicted was he to this slow-burning tale of a Soviet spy who infiltrates the Nazis in order to foil Operation Sunrise. That was the name given to the real-life secret negotiations between German and American intelligence, which aimed to forge a separate peace in the dying months of the war.“I don’t remember a time when I wasn’t aware of this series,” says Dina Newman, a journalist with the BBC World Service who was born in Moscow. “It came out when I was eight. It’s something I grew up with. Everybody at school talked about it. It quickly became part of our cultural experience, our folklore.”Like so much Soviet cultural output of the 70s, Seventeen Moments began as propaganda, part of the reforms initiated by Yuri Andropov, the recently appointed head of the KGB, to improve the security agency’s image. “Andropov felt the KGB’s authority had been damaged by Nikita Kruschev’s de-Stalinisation reforms,” says Newman. “He wanted to bring prestige and mystique back to the work of secret agents, in the hope of attracting educated, young recruits.”Andropov commissioned a series of books, songs and films to glorify the work of agents serving abroad. One was a piece of detective fiction by Yulian Semyonov. “Andropov had read Semyonov’s earlier novels,” says Jeremy Duns, an espionage expert and writer of spy novels. “He opened the KGB archives to him – including the classified files on Operation Sunrise.”Written in just two weeks, Seventeen Moments was commissioned as a TV series before it had even been published, under the guidance of one of the few female Soviet directors, Tatyana Lioznova. She was “assisted” by Andropov’s deputy and two KGB operatives brought in as “technical advisers”. Despite these incredibly restrictive conditions, Lioznova transformed propaganda into art, bringing in the brooding, handsome actor Vyacheslav Tikhonov to play the show’s double-agent hero, Max Otto von Stierlitz.Her other masterstroke was to commission the Soviet composer Mikael Tariverdiev to write the series’s score, which went way beyond atmospheric backdrop. “Tariverdiev’s music brings out Stierlitz’s inner life,” says musician and producer Stephen Coates. “One of the reasons it appealed to Soviet audiences at the time is its themes of loss and separation.”Coates has been a fan of Tariverdiev’s music since he first heard it in a Moscow cafe seven years ago. “Haunting, poignant and magical – it blew me away,” he says. “I got in contact with his widow, Vera, and we became friends.” Coates is now reissuing Tariverdiev’s works through the Earth Recordings label, and has organised a marathon screening of a subtitled Seventeen Moments at Pushkin House, London, this month.“One reason the series still stands up,” he says, “is that it retains an undercurrent of fear, of people being watched. In showing Hitler’s Germany, it was actually depicting Russia. People go about their business, but they’re never really free.”“Mikael wasn’t too thrilled about working on a spy series,” says Vera. “But he was intrigued by the possibilities. The plot required a continual musical theme. He agreed to work on the project only after finding the answer to that. He was introduced to an intelligence agent and discovered the details of his romantic inner life, which was nostalgia, the longing for a distant homeland.”There is a memorable six-minute scene in Seventeen Moments where Stierlitz and his wife meet in a German cafe. Not a word is spoken: there is just Tariverdiev’s mournful piano theme. The scene is based on real events. Soviet agents working abroad would be taken to see their loved ones, but couldn’t communicate with them. It was a demonstration of control: “We have her, she’s alive, stay loyal.”The scene, says Dina Newman, “went straight to the heart of the Soviet people. There is a coldness to the series. Much of its running time is taken up with wartime archive footage the Soviet army commandeered from the Germans. But its emotional side is carried by Tariverdiev’s music. It became an aspect of Stierlitz’s character. In this soulless world, it gave him a soul.“The main song, Moments, is based on a poem by Robert Rozhdestvensky about how each moment in life has profound significance. You could interpret it as being about the life of a foreign agent but it was written about life under a dictatorship, where any moment you could lose your position, your life, or betray someone and be promoted. It’s a philosophy born of Soviet life.”From that first broadcast Stierlitz became something of a Soviet folk hero, the anti-James Bond. “He’s a response to how the KGB was depicted as Smersh in the Bond films,” says Coates. “He’s very different from Bond. He spends more time gazing through windows than crashing through them. There’s a lot of smoking, a lot of being haunted by the motherland.”“I’d be fascinated to know if John le Carré has seen Seventeen Moments,” says Jeremy Duns. “Stierlitz is more like George Smiley than a Russian James Bond: a methodical, unemotional guy who silently observes while everyone else is digging their own grave.”Every year, the series was rebroadcast throughout Warsaw Pact nations on 9 May, the holiday that commemorates the surrender of the German army in 1945, and Stierlitz jokes became common currency, sending up the actor Tikhonov’s humourless, deadpan delivery. Yet the show did help to increase the Soviet people’s faith in their secret services, advancing the belief that the USSR had single-handedly won the war.The series had a curious afterlife in the chaos that marked the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In 1991, a St Petersburg film-maker made a short film about a local councillor, who’d previously worked as a Soviet spy in East Germany. One scene re-enacted the ending of Seventeen Moments, when Stierlitz drives back to Berlin. The councillor was filmed behind the wheel of his GAZ Volga with Tarivadiev’s Seventeen Moments theme, Somewhere Far Away, playing in the background.The councillor was Vladimir Putin. “It stuck,” says Newman. “People began to associate Putin with Stierlitz. Putin never said directly whether Stierlitz inspired him to become a spy. But he was 21 when the series was first screened and he joined the KGB two years later.”The association certainly didn’t do Putin any harm. In 1999, an opinion poll in the Kommersant newspaper asked readers who they’d like to see as Russia’s next president. Stierlitz came second, next to Marshal Zhukov, the Soviet Red Army general. The cover of the newspaper’s weekly supplement carried a picture of Stierlitz with the caption: “President – 2000.”“It proved that the second world war remained Russia’s highest point of achievement,” says Newman, “with military force still hugely respected. The previous president, Yeltsin, was boozy, jokey, generous. Now people wanted somebody a bit less Russian.”Amid the dishonesty and corruption of late-90s Russia, Putin stood apart – in no small way because he was seen as a Stierlitz-type figure. “Power should be mysterious and magic. Especially in Russia,” his former adviser, Gleb Pavolvsky, told Vanity Fair in October 2000. “Putin answers that need perfectly.”Eighteen years on, there can be few Russians who still think of Putin as Stierlitz, but the series remains ingrained in Russian culture. “Everybody still knows Seventeen Moments, even teenagers,” says Vera. “They’ve forgotten the name of the author, but the series? Yes, they all know it well.”• Seventeen Moments of Spring is at Pushkin House, London, 22-23 September. The score will be released by Earth Recordings in November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56851bbaa7b9ec18988903244d90917a68c778f4/0_223_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc13ee58cf00c530f94ed005408c4687","title":"monica dolan interview vanity fair rosemary west","story":"The Bafta-winning actor best known for Appropriate Adult and W1A talks about her meticulous preparation for her parts – down to finding the right pair of glasses for the Cromwell St killerWhere to begin the story of Monica Dolan? How did she become one of the UK’s best character actors? As someone who meticulously studies the people she plays – their origin, their background, everything from the glasses they wear to the way they look at you – Dolan might point to her birth 49 years ago, in Middlesborough general hospital. Her Irish parents, who had come to England for work and were living in Stockton-on-Tees, had previously moved around a lot due to demand for her father’s engineering skills. “There was a family joke that whenever my dad had painted the landing, they’d get notice that he’d have to move again,” she says.Shortly after she was born, the family moved again, finally settlingin Surrey. Here, Dolan was brought up, attended comprehensive school, and got her first taste of acting proper at youth theatre. One day, at the age of 14 or 15, travelling home from Northampton where the family had been visiting relatives,she was asked what she wanted to do with her life. “Sometimes you get those really weird opportunities when somebody asks you what you want to do and it really crystallises it for you,” she says. Rarely has the M1 been a route to such clarity.Before long, her appetite for performance had her sneaking into friends’ A-level drama classes. After school, and two years of auditioning,she gained a place at London’s prestigious Guildhall School of Music and Drama.In a sense, everything Dolan has achieved so far – from Tessa in JK Rowling’s The Casual Vacancy, to the Welsh BBC press officer Tracey in W1A and most recently her own foray into writing with the brilliant play The B*easts – can be traced back to these early years. But we must not forget Appropriate Adult, the 2011 drama in which she gave an electrifying portrayal of the serial killer Rosemary West. Not least because the role earned her a Bafta for best supporting actress.“It was absolutely extraordinary, that moment,” she recalls. “Walking down the steps to receive the Bafta, I could only go slowly because of the shoes I was wearing. I remember thinking to myself, ‘However long the music has to go on for me to get there, it’s not my responsibility – it’s their responsibility. So, I don’t have to rush.’ It was really funny and also it was obviously really nerve-racking to speak and accept it. I was so overcome.”The screenwriter and producer Russell T Davies has seen Dolan’s skill close up, after casting her as Marion Thorpe in A Very English Scandal, his take on the Jeremy Thorpe affair. Marion was Thorpe’s second wife and so only appears towards the end of the torrid, tragic tale. “It’s hard to turn up in a guest role on any drama,” Davies says. “Everyone else knows each other, and the production found its rhythm long before you arrived. And it’s even harder when there are lions roaming, when you’re got a star like Hugh Grant giving the performance of his life. So to watch Monica fit into that, carve her own space and find her own voice while harmonising with everyone else’s was an absolute joy. And God, she works hard. We had those scripts ready months in advance and she spent all that time analysing every detail. Watching footage of Marion Thorpe online. Asking me questions, questions, questions.”Now Dolan is about to join the cast of ITV’s Vanity Fair, again towards the end of its run. She is mesmerising as Mrs O’Dowd, a comedy character in Thackeray’s novel that she imbues with humanity and depth. So where does Dolan begin with a character? When she is telling the story, where does she start?The short answer is: with research. Lots of it. And according to Dolan, there are two parts to this. “There’s researching the script, which is very, very important,” she explains. “When you read a script, sometimes you find a line and think, ‘That’s completely inconsistent with the rest of it.’ The first instinct is usually to ask for it to be cut because you think, ‘No, that doesn’t fit in with my idea of the character.’ But quite often, I find that that’s the key to the character. The inconsistency. And everything else around it is hiding that. Because we all construct ourselves for the world, don’t we?”Then there’s finding out about the character themselves. Which hospital they were born in, perhaps, and where their parents were from.“I like playing real people,” she says, when I compare being an actor to being a detective or psychologist. “I’m interested in how different people tick. Quite often, after playing something good, or someone interesting, I feel ‘added to’.”“When I was playing the Queen Mother years ago, there was quite a lot of footage of Wallis Simpson,” she recalls. “You could look at her and you see where she’s looking or who she’s interested in. Is she looking at the man she loves, or is she looking at the people looking at her? And that gives you clues of how they might behave in private as well.”Even now, with the obvious sensitivities surrounding the Cromwell Street murders, Dolan is careful as to what she says about playing Rosemary, pirouetting with the precision of a prima ballerina in a minefield, clearly wary of anything she says being misconstrued as sympathy for the killer. So we talk about damaged people and the damage they do, and the difference between evil deeds and the desperately unhappy people who commit them. It’s worth noting that in her Bafta acceptance speech, Dolan drew attention to the fact that many of the Wests’ victims weren’t even reported missing. “I’d like to live in a world where everyone is missed,” she said.As well as research, Dolan says you shouldn’t underestimate the importance of hair, makeup and costume in the creation of a character. And she tells a story about trying to find the right pair of glasses for her rendering of Rosemary West.“Myself and Stephen Noble, the costume designer, went through lots of glasses and we got it down to two. I could see that he had a lot of work to do elsewhere and I said: ‘I’m really sorry, Stephen. Please don’t hate me, but I think the reason why we can’t choose between these two is because neither of them is right.’Even when she is not playing real people, Dolan’s commitment to her character is unwavering. Sarah Parish, who starred in W1A alongside Dolan, recalls how Dolan stayed Welsh for the part of Tracey “from the read-through through the entirety of the rehearsal period, the costume fittings, the makeup tests and the whole of the shoot. It wasn’t until after the shoot, when we met for a drink and she started talking in her own voice, I was like, ‘Whaaaat?’! She is absolutely incredible to watch from another actor’s point of view.”There is, of course, a paradox at the heart of Dolan’s brilliance: watching Dolan, it feels as if you are not watching Dolan at all. You are watching, are compelled by, the character she is inhabiting. The only thing that Dolan’s characters have in common is that they are completely different from each other and from her. Dolan has rightfully gained recognition for never being herself. Though she might diffidently suggest “I’ve got a face that can change quite easily with different hairstyles”, her most marvellous mechanic is that of a magician: she makes herself disappear. Dolan’s genius is that hers is a vanishing act.• Vanity Fair is on ITV on Sunday at 9pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b9a1b4100f0371ca5139d17ecb1e7588ac2655b/0_313_5326_3196/master/5326.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b14302a56e6f9a21c58d60065b093757","title":"harlem street names women new york mission","story":"As an intersection is renamed in Zora Neale Hurston’s honor, historians are fighting to preserve the Harlem black elite’s legacy so residents will be mindful of who existed before themThe building, built in 1901, housed many illustrious characters of the Harlem renaissance, the art and literary movement which reshaped the neighbourhood and radically transformed African American culture in the 1920s and 1930s. One of Graham Court’s most distinguished residents was Zora Neale Hurston, the famed chronicler of early 20th-century African American life.She lived there in the mid-1930s and this year, after an 11-year battle, the street intersection was finally named in her honor.Karen Taylor, founder and executive director of While We’re Still Here, a historical preservation society that works to document and preserve the historic homes of the Harlem black elite, remembers the tussle in the local community board over naming a major thoroughfare after the late author and anthropologist. She says that while Harlem boasts streets named after Martin Luther King Jr and Adam Clayton Powell Jr, “people may be reluctant to name a major thoroughfare after a woman, particularly a black woman”.It is an auspicious time for Taylor’s work: this year, a previously unpublished book by Hurston – Barracoon, the story of the last slave brought to the United States – became a New York Times bestseller. Taylor hopes the recent street naming will kickstart a domino effect – but commemorating black people, especially black women, across the city’s five boroughs is no easy task.Jacob Morris, president of the Harlem Historical Society, says of the newly minted Zora Neale Hurston Place: “God bless heaven. It’s serendipity. Could I have planned that in my wildest dreams? The answer is no.”For years, Morris excelled as a real estate agent working in Manhattan it wasn’t until he became dissatisfied with his son’s treatment at school – he has autism – that he started exploring advocacy work in earnest. Since 2006, he has orchestrated the commemoration of many black luminaries, including WEB DuBois, Thurgood Marshall and Paul Robeson.Tapping into his decades-long interest in history, Morris also began to study New York City’s role in the Underground Railroad, a secret network of routes and safe houses for African Americans fleeing from slavery. He applied for a federal grant and started collaborating with Richard Green of the Crown Heights Youth Collective. In 2005, they had their first success in street naming: Frederick Douglass Landing, named after the man famous for escaping from slavery and becoming the leader of an abolitionist moment.There is a complicated process to request a street sign be renamed in someone’s honor: after obtaining 200 signatures for the petition and the approval of the local community board, the proposal is passed to the city council and mayor for approval.Early in Morris’s activism, a young black woman on the community board told Morris that she would not approve his initiatives unless he included black women. He has been eternally grateful she corrected his oversight.The first New York City place renaming in honor of a black woman was just 25 years ago: Mary McLeod Bethune, who was a maverick educator and government official involved in the civil and women’s rights movements in the 20th century. A group of local second-grade students were studying Harlem’s history and one black boy asked why there weren’t any streets named after black women. The students successfully petitioned to have a street named after Bethune.“By the 1990s, feminist historians were challenging male-dominated historical narratives and more women were also entering local politics. It’s at this time that we begin to see more city streets named in honor of African American women.”Until 2010, there were over 100 places named after black people across the city, but less than 15 honoring black women. In addition to Hurston, Jacob Morris is responsible for honoring A’Lelia Walker, a patron of the arts during the Harlem Renaissance and daughter of Madam CJ Walker, who was the first female self-made millionaire in America Ella Baker, a prominent civil rights activist singer Billie Holiday, and Dr Susan Smith McKinney, the first black woman to earn a medical degree in the state of New York.A’Lelia Bundles, an award-winning journalist and great-great granddaughter to Walker, is thrilled by those initiatives. “When our stories aren’t told and our contributions are ignored, the message to us and to others is that our lives don’t matter, that our lives aren’t worthy,” she says. “Never underestimate the power of a street sign or a historical marker to inspire a young person, to raise awareness of an ally and to challenge the ignorance of a bigot.”On a walking tour around Harlem, Morris juxtaposed the way men are commemorated in public spaces versus women. Near the corner of West 150th and Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard, there is a playground, mural and plaque dedicated to Bill “Bojangles” Robinson, a famous black tap dancer and actor whose career ned four decades.One block over, there is a granite monument standing at the entrance of a playground named after Frederick Johnson, the former trainer of Althea Gibson, who was the first person of color in tennis to win a grand slam, one of the most important tournaments of the sport, and first black woman on the cover of Sports Illustrated and Time, among other accomplishments. Yet the two tennis courts connected to the playground where Althea Gibson trained as a youth have no monuments or plaques dedicated to Gibson.Morris feels like he’s in a race against time because of gentrification. Soon, he argues, Harlem will no longer be a black majority neighborhood. These historical legacies need to be cemented now or the elements that made the neighborhood great will forever be lost.Nevertheless, Morris has more women to honor.

Her husband added: “It’s as though they wanted to drain every positive feeling out of us.”They knew, from following the news, that their ordeal of escaping gang violence back home and trekking across desert terrain at the height of summer would not end when they reached the United States.What they did not expect, though, were days of hunger, separation and verbal abuse that they said they endured at the hands of federal immigration officials.All they were given to eat, they said, were half-frozen bologna sandwiches, served at 10 in the morning, five in the afternoon and two in the morning, and single sugar cookies for their daughter. What water they were given had a strong chlorine taste – a common complaint – and upset their stomachs.The Martinezes (not their real name) were among dozens of asylum-seekers the  interviewed in the border city of McAllen recently after they secured their provisional release from federal custody – with black electronic monitors fastened tightly around their ankles – and just before they continued their journeys by bus to the homes of US-based sponsors to await court hearings on their statuses. sat in with a team of volunteer doctors and nurses administering emergency medical care and listened as family after family gave jarringly consistent accounts of what they described as grim conditions in a variety of border detention facilities – conditions that have grown only grimmer since the advent of Donald Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policies.Officials said the allegations made by families about their experiences in detention did not equate with what they knew to be common practice and they insisted detainees were treated with dignity and respect.The “hieleras”, or iceboxes, asylum-seekers said, were overcrowded, unhygienic, and prone to outbreaks of vomiting, diarrhea, respiratory infections and other communicable diseases. Many complained about the cruelty of guards, who they said would yell at children, taunt detainees with promises of food that never materialized, and kick people who did not wake up when they were expected to.At regular intervals, day and night, the Martinezes, and many others, said guards would come banging on the walls and doors and demand that they present themselves for roll call.If they talked too loudly, or if children were crying, the guards would threaten to turn the air temperature down further. When the Martinezes gathered with fellow detainees to sing hymns and lift their spirits a little, the guards would taunt them, or ask aggressively: “Why did you bother coming here? Why didn’t you stay in your country?”“Many of these agents were Latinos, like us, but they were people without morals,” Rafael Martinez said his voice choking with tears. “There we were, caged up like animals, and they were laughing at us.”When three-year-old Jenny Martinez came down with a bad case of the flu, she and her mother were taken to a hospital where, they said, they were left waiting for hours with nowhere to sit or lie down, and no blankets, before receiving medication. Back in the detention facility, they were put in isolation and even Rafael was denied access to them.Kimberly noticed that her daughter, like many of the detainees, was growing more jaundiced by the day for lack of vitamins or fresh air or sunshine. The toilets were filthy – with no seat covers and no toilet paper – and Kimberly observed that staff members did not throw out the crinkly blankets when detainees were moved or released they simply passed them along to new arrivals.Officials at various agencies often question the reliability of such accounts and say they cannot respond to inidual cases without knowing more about the specifics than the immigrants and their lawyers, if they have them, are generally able or willing to disclose. collected the testimony of dozens of people – many interviewed directly, and others whose accounts were recorded by members of the medical team – and found broad corroboration of the types of conditions described by the Martinezes from half a dozen people or more for each of the types of tough treatment mentioned.Not all facilities were equally bad. Many of the families said their worst experiences were at facilities where they were first housed and processed after being apprehended. It was not clear from their descriptions – and from conversations with federal officials – if these “hieleras” were border patrol outposts or Ice (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) detention centers.Most of the families were subsequently transferred to a building they called “la perrera” – literally, the dog pound – that appeared to correspond to the border patrol’s central processing center in McAllen, a low-slung industrial warehouse that is the largest facility of its kind in the American south-west, where they said the temperatures were warmer, the staff was kinder, they had burritos and apples instead of frozen sandwiches, and they were at last allowed to shower.The numbers of migrants landing in federal detention have been relentless since the advent of “zero tolerance” in April, as families continue to flee gang violence in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala in particular.Staff at a Catholic Charities respite center in McAllen, where released detainees are offered food, showers, fresh clothing and medical attention before they continue on their travels, said they had expected to see the numbers drop from a high of about 300 people per day in May and June – the period when parents and children were being separated as a matter of policy – to about 60 or 80, but instead they were still seeing close to 200 people being dropped at a nearby bus station each afternoon.Many migrants arrive in the United States already weak from their journeys and traumatized by violence at home.What awaits them in immigration detention facilities, though, according to civil rights lawyers and doctors who have examined them, only retraumatizes them and raises disturbing questions about the US government’s willingness to adhere to its own guidelines and to a flurry of court orders that have, over the past two years, mandated more humane treatment of those in its care.Most of the interviewees in McAllen reported being held between three and seven days. Some accounts – provided first-hand by one former detainee and secondhand by a number of others – indicated that some people are held for 10 days or more.They were not given mats to sleep on, or toothbrushes or toothpaste, despite a 2016 federal court order mandating these basic amenities.Many – particularly men – said they had not even received blankets. New litigation filed this summer, based on accounts similar to those collected by the , has prompted a federal judge in California to order the appointment of a retired immigration judge to investigate conditions in detention centers with a view to mandating further changes.Many of the complaints about immigrant detention centers predate the Trump administration.The advent of “zero tolerance” has, however, greatly increased pressure on the system, forcing federal officials to improvise solutions, and triggered an unusually large flurry of fresh litigation. Federal officials uncomfortable at the reports of mistreatment say it is very difficult to track who is doing what, especially since immigrants making the complaints do not know where exactly they were being held, or by whom.“We’re talking about so many people – border patrol, Ice, contractors, medical personnel – it’s difficult to know who is doing what,” one federal official told the  on condition of anonymity.Many immigration experts, meanwhile, say they see a disturbing new tendency on the part of the Trump administration to disregard the rules, including explicit court orders, and to discourage officials lower down the chain of command from sitting down with their critics and attempting to solve problems before they get to court.Last Thursday, for example, the administration announced it would no longer abide by a 20-year-old court settlement obliging the government to release children from detention after 20 days.“I’ve been doing work with detainees for 20 years, and the biggest change in my mind is the government’s attitude of impunity,” said Holly Cooper, a law professor at the University of California at Davis who is suing the government over the administration of psychotropic drugs to immigrant children at a juvenile detention center near Houston.“Before, I could sit down with government officials and they would at least hear me out as I strived to push the needle toward something more humane … Now there’s a total kibosh on talking to civil rights lawyers.”At the border, the upshot of these changes is a panoply of shocking experiences inflicted on families who, in many cases, have fled in terror from their homes and are betting their future on what is an increasingly long-shot chance at being granted asylum in the United States.The Martinezes left Honduras after Rafael’s father, sister and brother-in-law were killed by local gangs and word went out that they were after him too. Another Central American man interviewed by the  had a scar running across his face from a machete blow.Many interviewees described a sense of humiliation as US officials ordered them to remove their belts, shoelaces and long-sleeved shirts (all considered potential suicide risks) and pushed them into overcrowded chain-link cages.Doctors and nurses who treated the asylum seekers after their release said they saw a lot of boils and skin rashes, attributable to the lack of hygiene, and severe constipation, attributable to dehydration and poor food intake.Almost everybody who came through the clinic attended by the , run by a San Antonio-based group of volunteer doctors, nurses and social workers called Sueños sin Fronteras (Dreams without Borders), complained of flu symptoms or respiratory problems or both. Many of the ex-detainees said they had been forced to abandon their medicines – as well as clothing and other possessions – when they were released from custody.Stories of medical negligence have also circulated. An HIV-positive Guatemalan woman who came through in July told one of the Sueños sin Fronteras team she had had her medicines taken away as soon as she entered detention and was kept in isolation away from her young child for five days. A five-year-old Guatemalan girl with appendicitis went undiagnosed for days at the McAllen processing center – despite repeated entreaties for help from her mother – and almost died when the appendix ruptured.A group called Immigrant Families Together told the  that a four-year-old boy who arrived in the United States with a broken femur had been given only mild pain medication at the Texas detention facility where he was held and ended up undergoing orthopedic surgery after his release.While deaths remain relatively rare, a recent Human Rights Watch report found that more immigrants had died in detention in 2017 than in any year since 2009. It deplored evidence of “subpar and dangerous practices including unreasonable delays, poor practitioner and nursing care, and botched emergency response”.The Department of Homeland Security has continued to defend its practices in response to such public reports and also in court.A Customs and Border Protection (CBP) spokeswoman said she “strongly disagrees” with the allegations presented in this piece. “The alleged incidents do not equate to what we know to be common practice at our facilities. We treat those in our custody with dignity and respect,” the CBP said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef025e1e11680a71293c3edf3829ec8197266fe0/0_94_3009_1805/master/3009.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea0c85221cbe2fc015f0659142f50a93","title":"eu meps vote to pursue action against hungary over orban crackdown","story":"Parliament votes for first time to trigger article 7 procedure against a member stateThe European parliament has voted to trigger the EU’s most serious disciplinary procedure against Hungary, saying the country’s government poses a “systematic threat” to democracy and the rule of law.The vote was carried with the support of 448 MEPs, narrowly clearing the required two-thirds majority, after Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, was abandoned by his allies in the centre-right European People’s party.The outcome heightens the prospect of a split in the EU’s dominant centre-right bloc – to which the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, also belongs – which has been riven by isions over migration and the future of Europe.It also reveals the isolation of British Conservative MEPs, who sit in a rival centre-right group and chose to vote with the Orbán government. Tory MEPs had said triggering the disciplinary procedure for member states seen as at risk of breaching basic democratic values would be counterproductive and would set a dangerous precedent.It is the first time the legislature has triggered an article 7 procedure against an EU member state. The most severe punishment under article 7 is stripping a country of its voting rights in the EU.The Dutch MEP who led the process, Judith Sargentini, was given a standing ovation as the result was announced. She said she was proud to have gained the support of the European parliament but the outcome was “first and foremost about democratic rights”.Since Orbán returned to power in 2010 his government has introduced measures to curb judicial independence and increase control over the media, and imposed restrictions that could lead to the closure of the Central European University (CEU). Charges detailed by a slew of international observers from the United Nations to the Council of Europe formed the basis of the report by the European parliament.The European parliament also raised concerns about corruption, as well as alleged misuse of EU funds by Orbán’s son-in-law.Speaking before the vote, Orbán told MEPs on Tuesday that Hungary was being singled out for choosing not to be “a country of migrants”, and he dismissed the charges of corruption.In a sign of his anger towards the EPP leader, Manfred Weber, Orbán accused his European allies of a “double standard” on the CEU, claiming academic restrictions were stricter in Weber’s native Bavaria.He claimed the EPP was “dancing to the tune” of socialists and liberals. “We have a different view on Christianity in Europe, the role of nations and national culture. Even differences on the essence of the family, and we do have radically different views on immigration,” he said. “These differences cannot be a reason to brand any country and be excluded from joint decisions.”The parliament’s report called on EU member states to come up with “appropriate measures to restore inclusive democracy, the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights in Hungary”.The vote is only the start of a long, drawn out process where the outcome is unclear. Under the article 7 procedure, the assent of four-fifths of EU member states is needed to issue the first formal warning. The next step requires unanimity, and a mutual defence pact between Hungary and Poland could scupper further action, diminishing the chances of Hungary losing voting rights.Hours before the vote, the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, swung his weight behind the EU’s sanction process. “We continue to be very concerned by the developments in some of our member states,” Juncker said in his annual state of the union speech. “Article 7 must be applied whenever the rule of law is threatened.”Daniel Dalton, a British Conservative MEP, accused the parliament of overstepping its powers with the report. “MEPs have no role to play in the process and their involvement leaves any subsequent legal action open to the accusation that it is politically motivated,” he said.

Created shortly after the street artist famously depicted Barack Obama, it went on sale in 2009 to help raise funds for rights groups petitioning Myanmar’s then-ruling generals to release her from house arrest.“At the time, Fairey’s image of Obama had really made him incredibly popular, so many people were excited that his iconic portrait of Aung San Suu Kyi would help popularise the cause of democracy and human rights in Myanmar,” says Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch (HRW).He said HRW encouraged Fairey to create the poster because staff “felt that she was an inspirational person who really stood for treating people with dignity and supporting human rights”.Nine years later, Myanmar’s military stands accused by UN investigators of genocide against Rohingya Muslims, almost a million of whom have fled the country to escape campaigns of murder, rape, and arson over the past two years. They accused Aung San Suu Kyi herself of having “contributed to the commission of atrocity crimes”.In the past year, a major British trade union, the London School of Economics, the US Holocaust Museum, Dublin and at least four UK cities have withdrawn major honours from Aung San Suu Kyi while condemning her failure to protect the Rohingya minority. Inside Myanmar, however, she remains nearly as popular as ever, seen as a bulwark against both military encroachment into politics and international condemnation.“I still have a framed copy of the portrait signed by Shepard Fairey. It was a birthday present from my wife,” says Simon Billenness, a former executive director of the US Campaign for Burma (USCB).As he was preparing for a Skype meeting with other rights activists last year, Billenness removed the portrait from his wall. “I didn’t want it seen in the background,” he says. “To me, it now represents the hopes that we projected onto Aung San Suu Kyi. The portrait is certainly not representative of her performance in power.”Another organisation that raised funds through Fairey’s poster was the Human Rights Action Center, whose founder, Jack Healey, is best known for mobilising celebrities to promote awareness of human rights issues. He tells the : “There have been no sales of the Aung San Suu Kyi poster in years. We gave most of the ones we had away for free.”At HRW, on a copy of the poster in its New York office, a staff member attached a note to the end of the phrase “Freedom to lead” saying “or not”.“Everyone who saw it immediately laughed and then wondered whether they should be crying instead,” says Robertson. “Working on human rights issues requires a sense of humour even in the worst situations, so that put-down of Aung San Suu Kyi for her failure of leadership on human rights really resonated.”The poster and the note hang in HRW’s Asia ision office, while in New York, Robertson says, “there are a couple hundred more copies gathering dust”.This reaction to Aung San Suu Kyi’s iconography is countered at home. In October 2017, shortly after Myanmar’s heaviest assault on the Rohingya began, a handful of painters gathered in a Yangon gallery to paint portraits of the leader they call “Mother Suu”. They were protesting against the removal of a different portrait of Aung San Suu Kyi from an Oxford University building a week earlier.In February, Yangon’s regional government hung a towering portrait of her at a construction site overlooking a park where political protests are commonly held, and sometimes crushed.A spokesperson for Fairey said he would be unable to comment because of scheduling constraints. When Esquire asked him in 2015 whether Barack Obama had lived up to the “Hope” poster, Fairey said: “Not even close.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a27997bf1ef277efeb62a9d047f79d20ba7073cf/0_4_3582_2150/master/3582.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66d91e4e54c37da6021010bd686f3ab2","title":"syria conflict why does idlib matter and what could happen","story":"Fears of a refugee crisis and ‘killbox’ as rebels prepare for likely last stand against AssadPro-government forces are massing in Syria’s north-west for what could be a large-scale offensive on Idlib province, the last opposition stronghold in the country. The UN has warned of the “worst humanitarian catastrophe” of this century if the attack goes ahead, since there are no remaining opposition areas to which those fleeing Idlib could be evacuated.The province is central to the outcome of the war and also the fate of the broader region. As the seven-year conflict draws to a close, each participant in the war, Syrian and non-Syrian, is trying to secure their interests, many of which run through Idlib. But few of those interests align. Most are mutually exclusive.External powers trying to carve out influence in northern Syria are Russia and Iran, to whom Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, owes his successes so far, and Turkey, in whom rebel groups continue to pin their hopes. There is also what remains of a fractured anti-Assad opposition, jihadist groups and a regime desperate to claim it has won the war.Above all, there at least 3 million people cornered in north-west Syria with nowhere to go. Many live in frugal shelters in crammed towns and villages, and some have fled to the fields in fear of the same sort of intensive Russian-led bombardment seen elsewhere in Syria.NGOs predict up to 700,000 people could leave their homes or shelters if a big attack is launched. The vast majority are likely to be unwilling to cross back into regime-controlled territory, fearing the retribution of a government from which they have fled.Of Idlib’s 3 million citizens, at least 1.5 million are believed to be exiles from elsewhere in Syria, particularly areas taken in conflict by Russian, Iranian and Syrian government forces, such as Ghouta and Darraya near Damascus, Homs, east Aleppo and Deraa. After each battlefield victory, communities who have not come to terms with Syrian officials have been given safe passage to the province.As the numbers of people have mounted, fears have risen that Idlib is being set up as a killbox – a place where jihadists are mixed in with civilians to reaffirm a Syrian government narrative that the 2011 anti-Assad uprising was all about jihad in the first place. Assad’s officials have branded all those who stood against him as terrorists, and years of dehumanising language has clouded the reality of who is living in Idlib and to whom they are aligned.The vast majority of the province’s population are Syrian citizens, mostly Arabs but with significant numbers of Kurds. Civilians greatly outweigh fighters, by at least 100 to one, according to UN estimates.Among those who have taken up arms in the province are the latest incarnation of original anti-Assad groups, reinforced by militants who have arrived from elsewhere in Syria. These groups are backed by Turkey and are in a contest for influence with the conservative Islamist group Tahrir al-Sham, which remains the strongest organisation in the area.Roughly half of the 10,000 fighters in the Islamists’ ranks are foreigners, with the al-Qaida-aligned Hurras al-Din part of the group. The dissolution of both is a key demand of Russia, which will call the shots in any offensive. Turkey has said it needs more time to force the militants to leave. Where they would go remains unclear and Ankara’s demands for a truce, made during a recent trilateral summit in Tehran, were rebuffed by Moscow.Tahrir al-Sham remains the strongest group on the anti-Assad side, and the Turkish-backed Northern Front is also prominent. Both groups are well armed but are no match for the Russian air force or ageing, though effective, Syrian cannons and artillery pieces.Idlib is likely to be the last stand for those who first fought against Assad and others who have since joined the battle. The original uprising, beginning in the 2011 Arab spring, was fed partly by a class struggle that gave rise to a protest movement, joined by nationalists, conservatives, Islamists, jihadists – who used Syria as a platform for broader ambitions – and opportunists in search of power at any cost.On the pro-Assad side are what remains of the Syrian army, among them nationalists committed to saving the country and others loyal to the Assad regime. There are also militias raised as a home guard who played increasingly prominent roles when state structures were tested as the conflict went on.Key are Russian forces, led by the air force, which saved Assad from defeat in September 2015 and have asserted control over the war ever since. While the Russians have controlled the skies, Iranian-backed militias have dominated the ground war. They were the first into east Aleppo and have been active on most battlefields. Lebanon’s Hezbollah, the most important Iranian proxy, has lost more than 1,700 fighters in Syria. Afghani, Iraqi and Yemeni fighters, as well as Iranians, have also died in large numbers.Whether Iranian-backed forces join the fight for Idlib will be key to whether the offensive is launched and how long it lasts. The Syrian opposition political bloc believes Iran is reluctant to commit the numbers it deployed earlier in the war. The Syrian army, meanwhile, is struggling to muster a large-scale fighting force that could support its heavy weapons and helicopters.The UN believes up to 700,000 newly displaced people would head towards the Turkish border or areas east of Idlib within 48 hours. While supplies of food and water into Idlib remain stable for now, an exodus of that scale would severely test an aid response. Turkey has said it will not let large numbers of new refugees across its now fortified border. That leaves a swathe of northern Syria it controls, known as the Euphrates Shield zone. This area is likely to be a destination for rebels looking for the last possible haven on Syrian soil.Ankara plans to use the Euphrates Shield area as leverage in Syria in the post-Idlib phase, but it would come under intense pressure to allow it to be used as a final refuge if and when an attack is launched. Meanwhile, it has said it will not allow Idlib province to be turned into a “lake of blood”.Owning a humanitarian catastrophe of a scale that dwarfs anything else in Syria would be a big price for Russia to pay. Syria, too, would be likely to viewed as culpable in an offensive that leads to a larger-scale loss of life than in previous attacks. While international opinion has mostly mattered little to protagonists on both sides of the war, the scale of the potential bloodshed is galvanising outrage.It may not be enough to stop the war but it is likely to mean that fears of an imminent full-scale blitz could be misplaced. Instead, a slowly increasing rate of attacks that leads people to steadily leave rather than flee in panic could well be a plan of action."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9062838da983c2d2303c2f500fae1ea61ada924/0_331_3894_2338/master/3894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=246f9973942d17cb483a3023a206b994","title":"europe eu far right democracy","story":"Not enough attention is paid to young pro-democracy, pro-EU activists. They don’t make headlines, but they matterSo, as it turns out, the far right did not swamp Sweden in Sunday’s election. Beware doom-laden forecasts about Europe: sometimes they bear less relation to reality than to the ideology of those who seek to undermine the European project, have deep qualms about it, or just\u0026nbspthink it’s going to the dogs. Loud, scary headlines make for more clicks. Polarised discourses breed oversimplification. I’m not sure I’ve always avoided it.But something else is at work in the way Europe is increasingly framed and distorted: an insidious Brexit-Trump lens is too readily slapped on to the old continent. The English-language international media play a big role in this. Taken together, they produce a “reading” of Europe in which the EU is headed for the scrapheap of history, sliding irrevocably towards a political crash in much the same way the UK and US did in 2016: a brutal, overnight departure from much of what pre-existed, and was up until then deemed secure. What’s happened to us is coming your way.This Anglosphere take on Europe comes loaded with confirmation bias, if not schadenfreude. It flourishes in digital information feedback loops. Crisscrossing the Atlantic and the Channel, it spills out of both “alt-right” and “alt-left” milieux, which can easily converge in their hostility to the European project, if for different reasons. Even among moderates it exists, cloaked in the thick layers of anxiety and confusion surrounding the Brexit negotiations, with even stalwart remainers starting to look for continental foes out to harm the UK, as a result of domestic populist pressures.In the familiar doom-and-gloom script, the far right overruns us all. Racist rioting in the eastern German city of Chemnitz is just the start: street violence will soon become the new normal (no matter that a week later, 60,000 people turned up at an antiracist concert there). Sweden’s election is just another turn of the fascist wheel (never mind that the far-right Sweden Democrats made only third place and the ruling Social Democrats, though weakened, led at the ballot box).Election after election, the continent falls prey to the worst of the worst. Demagogues thrive. Authoritarianism spreads, Viktor Orbán and Matteo Salvini its flag-bearers. The air thickens with 1930s-style hate, fear and democratic collapse. The EU falls apart.But what if the premises of this European disaster movie weren’t accurate, or even remotely likely? What if we were busy scaring ourselves rather than looking forensically at the facts in their entirety? What if we were at risk of caving in to the European “carnage” newspeak of hardline Brexiters and Trumpian ideologues, rather than taking in the many shades of grey and colour?In the US, the craziness of Trump led some to initially turn to Europe as an answer to their own despondency (Angela Merkel as “leader of the free world” or Emmanuel Macron as a global, liberal poster child). And when that didn’t fully materialise, all bets were off and an end-of-the-democratic-world narrative set in.In autumn 2017 a New Yorker visiting London said to me: “You’re French? Paris is the capital of the resistance!” I was dumbstruck. Over lunch recently in London, a colleague asked me whether I thought England might resemble something Europe is turning into – the suggestion perhaps being that antisemitic, neofascist militias would soon roam the streets of our capital cities.Take into account the difficulty and cost of regular, in-depth media coverage of Europe’s almost unfathomable patchwork of political cultures and national histories, and what you end up with is a fabric of preconceptions. Don’t get me wrong. There are brilliant British and American journalists working in Europe. But the UK and US obsession with Brexit and Trump results in coverage that depicts Europe through a navel-gazing lens.Not enough attention is being paid to pro-democracy, pro-EU networks of young, grassroots activists across Europe. They hardly make headlines, while a mindless minority trying to hound foreigners in Chemnitz does. For all the talk of Emmanuel Macron coming undone as a result of a rail strike earlier this year (remember the speculation about a repetition of Paris 1968?), he’s now working to build alliances ahead of next year’s European elections. Marine Le Pen may have Steve Bannon as a friend, but she has run into serious financial trouble as a result of her party being accused of misusing funds earmarked for aides’ salaries. The prospect of Angela Merkel’s political death was again exaggerated when she was challenged this summer by her own sister party, the CSU. Signs are, she has now come out the winner of that tussle. The German Greens are on the upsurge. Who’s shouting about that?This is not to say Europe’s problems should be minimised. It makes sense to trigger alarm bells rather than be complacent – especially when you read about a crowd screaming “National socialism, now, now, now!” somewhere in Germany. With immigration the overarching theme of Europe’s political debates, there is a logic to Macron and his allies talking about an existential moment in which just two blocs – “progressives” and “nationalists” – confront each other.But Orbán’s and Salvini’s importance can be overstated: they and their allies remain but minorities when scrutinised on the scale of a continent. Eurobarometer polls show that EU membership is highly popular, even in countries whose leaderships lambast it, such as Poland. People want Europe to do more and better, not to pull out of it altogether.Looked at from a distance, it’s tempting to simplify continental Europe. There is mental comfort in drawing patterns that supposedly apply systematically, indifferent to geography barring a few details. Just as there is a Brexit-Trump lens, there is its opposite number: a high-minded, romantic, EU-power-or-bust narrative from those who want to keep EU founding father Jean Monnet’s construct alive.I’m unashamedly part of the latter, but it’s important to be aware of the dangers of the former. As Monnet once said, ask not whether we must be optimistic or pessimistic ask whether we are determined.

The National Hurricane Center is warning that a life-threatening storm surge along the coast of South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia is likely. Forecasters are also warning of heavy rainfall which could cause life-threatening flooding further inland.Based on historical forecasts, the NHC track forecast cone, or “cone of uncertainty”, is the probable path of the centre of a tropical cyclone. The cone increases in size over time to indicate the greater areas of uncertainty about its path. The majority of flooding from the storm surge is caused by a phenomenon known as the Coriolis effect. The Earth’s rotation causes storms in the northern hemisphere to rotate anticlockwise, meaning a hurricane’s winds are deflected toward the right of the storm’s centre. Storms in the southern hemisphere behave the opposite way."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3620716.1536246721!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how the sligo school with no curriculum or timetable is turning teaching upside down","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNigel Coen and Julie Meehan with their daughters Amie  (4)  and Clarion Coen (7), with the school’s co-founders Maura Duignan and Gayle Nagle at Sligo Sudbury School. Photograph: James ConnollyAs thousands of children settle back into classrooms under the watchful eye of their teachers, students at a new school in rural Co Sligo will be free to choose their own subjects and timetables.The Sudbury School of self-directed learning is a school with a difference. It is run by “direct democracy” in which students and staff are treated as equals.Students also have complete responsibility for their own education. A core part of its ethos is that students can decide what to do with their time such as climbing trees, reading, or surfing their tablets.The students, who range from five to 18 years, can start anytime between 8.30am-10.30am and leave at any stage between 2.30pm-4.30pm at the school.It sounds, in short, like a helicopter parent’s worse nightmare. But it is proving popular with families who are keen for a break from the mainstream model of education.It’s the second such school to open in Ireland, with its Wicklow counterpart now starting into its third year with 28 pupils.It doesn’t come cheap, though. The community-based project in Sligo does not receive any government funding and so charges tuition fees of €3,900 a year, costs which the school says are in line with many fee-paying schools. In the Wicklow model, fees start at €2,400 and rise depending on gross household income.In addition to local children who have enrolled in the Sligo start-up, a number of families are relocating from Dublin, Meath and Kerry as well as moving home from Australia, America and Malta to ensure their children are part of a democratic community, according to founders Gayle Nagle and Maura Duignan.“Parents are choosing the school so their children can engage in the natural process of experiential learning and to be part of a self-governed democratic community,” says Nagle.“They are free to explore their own learning pursuits and interests, in their own time, style and at their own pace and they have the space to get to know themselves better and to develop, expand and refine self-awareness.“They also learn how to be part of a community which values iniduals and autonomy and ensures responsibility and respect for all.”The Sudbury School is not subject to Department of Education inspections. However, it is registered and assessed by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. Nagle adds that self-assessment is also integral to them.There are many Sudbury School worldwide, all independent, but generally all influenced in their ethos by writers such as AS Neill, John Holt, and Peter GrayBoth Nagle and Duignan had been home-schooling their own children but liked the idea of a more social setting for their kids to meet others while continuing to follow their own pursuits.“Maura and I met through the home-education network,” says Nagle. “We had both been home-schooling for a number of years, but liked the idea of allowing children the freedom to educate in their own way and pace with other students.“Sometimes access to other children can be an issue when home-schooling. I have a background in education and while we are not against the current system at all, we just feel mainstream education is successful for some children but not for others. Sometimes the one-size-fits-all just doesn’t work.”There will be no imposed curriculum for the students but Nagle stresses that there will be a number of rules to be observed, which are formed through the school’s democratic process.“One law is that all members of the community have the right to go about their day in a peaceful way,” she says.Regular school meetings will involve all children who use their vote on various issues they’d like to see changed or employed.“Children can read all day if they want, but you’ll find that different groups will all go and play together for a few hours, then maybe make something to eat and then do another activity,” says Nagle. “They learn at their own pace, in their own time and in their own way.”She explains that external tutors may be employed for specific subject areas if these skills are not available among the staff.“You can’t live a day without using maths in some form but if, for example, a child needs algebra for a project and wants additional support with it, then by all means, we will get a tutor in for them.”She argues that students at Sudbury will thrive at third-level colleges, having developed a high internal motivation to study their already nurtured interest.“Students have only known self-learning through the Sudbury model so are already disciplined to study at third-level,” she says.“At that stage, they have also honed in on their interests so often their course choice reflects perfectly on this.“Many colleges are now allocating places for children coming from home-schooling or models like Sudbury but if students wish to sit any kind of exams, they will be also supported in that.”At the Wicklow Sudbury School, demand for places has grown so that the self-funded charity in Kilpedder is now seeking a bigger property in the north of the county to cater for more students.Over the two years, founders and staff in Wicklow have, they say, recognised huge changes in each child.“In that time, most students have gone through different phases of dealing with the freedom of time and space they are given and many of the six to 16-year-olds have developed a clearer idea of goals they want to set themselves,” says the Wicklow school’s co-founder Sonja Luescher Keogh“Others have found satisfaction in exploring more spontaneously, mainly joining the various activities at the school including music, art, programming, bushcraft, film-making, sports and writing.”One 16-year-old student received a diploma in criminal and forensic psychology earlier this year, while a 14-year-old recently started a degree in philosophy, economics and politics with the Open University.“The children and adults have collectively created their own community rules and procedures and taken ownership of the school,” she says“The effect that this aspect alone has on each person’s sense of responsibility and self-worth is significant.”‘Students here seem happier and less stressed’: Why one student opted for the Sudbury SchoolKate Burns (14) jumped at the chance of ditching mainstream education for a system she has spent the past two years researching.“I’m really excited. I just feel that kids learn so much better when they can choose what they’d like to be taught,” she said.“I’m really interested in politics and so I was researching school systems online for a few years and Sudbury kept coming up.“Students seem happier and less stressed. There are such a lot of students stressed here and it’s insane that it’s overlooked.“I was stressed at mainstream school with being told what, and what not, to do. I’m the kind of girl who will keep asking why and I think Sudbury will give me answers that I couldn’t get in mainstream education.“I often fell behind at school in Irish but here I can go back to easier levels and learn at my own pace how to be fluent instead of stressing to catch up.”Her mother, Dorothy, is backing her daughter all the way.“Education is like a buffet of everything and kids are force-fed in mainstream schools,” she says.“Here she can pick and choose what she wants. The bottom line is she’s happy. I was dragging her out of bed each morning and watching her go to school upset – that couldn’t carry on.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3626747.1536754681!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"simon harris says screening programme audit utterly botched","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Health Simon Harris speaks to the media after today’s Cabinet meeting that discussed the Scally report. Photograph: Leah FarrellRollingNews.ieMinister for Health Simon Harris has said the Scally report showed there were “huge failings” that needed to be addressed in the cervical cancer screening programme but insisted the programme was safe. Mr Harris said the report into CervicalCheck found a “system-wide failing” and that the audit of the programme was “clearly utterly botched” in how the information produced by the audit was handled.Speaking to reporters at Government Buildings before the unveiling of the report, Mr Harris particularly welcomed the findings that the laboratories being used for the screening programme “meet quality management processes” and that there was “no reason that they cannot continue to be used”.“I have been asked the question - is it safe to use the labs? . . . Today Dr Scally answers the question clearly. And that message cannot get lost,” he said.The Minister said it wasn’t “about cancer misdiagnosis - he does find that the labs were safe to use”, but he acknowledged the additional pain and suffering caused to women and their families by the non-disclosure of the results of the audits.However, Mr Harris said the “widespread non-disclosure of the results of screening audits was a substantial breach of trust for the women and families involved”.The Minister said he would bring forward proposals next month for an independent patient safety council, adding there would be two patient representatives on the new board of the HSE. He said the Government would legislate for a new duty of candour requiring mandatory disclosure of “serious reportable events” and said the new laws would impose an inidual duty of disclosure on healthcare professionals, not just on the hospital they work in. Mr Harris said the Government would recruit new leadership for the screening programme.He said the report found blame could not be ascribed to iniduals. “It’s the easiest thing in the world to say this person did it or that person did it, and when iniduals fail, iniduals should be held to account. But sometimes the truth is more complex,” Mr Harris said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Mercedes van without front registration plate used by masked menBarbara Chew, a recovering drug addict, died at her home in Lucan last yearReview of Cervical check system says there was a whole system failureScally report \u0026lsquofinds huge failings\u0026rsquo in CervicalCheck programmeActivists served notice to vacate Belvedere Place property in DublinRuth Morrissey facing terminal diagnosis because of alleged misreadings of testsSix arrested as garda\u0026iacute in balaclavas block protesters from entering building on North Frederick StreetTrump fundraiser set to be America\u0026rsquos representative in IrelandCouncil wants to restore Mountjoy Square to how it looked in 1837Representatives of universities and third-level colleges and institutions that cater for all levels are presentPilot test of new review methodology takes place at Kilmore diocese and Glenstal AbbeyMore than 62,000 Junior Cert students set for results todayScally report to recommend overhaul, and automatic informing of errors to womenOutgoing Barnardos chief says situation for children worse now than when he took job in 2005New agency\u0026rsquos initiative is to drive down the cost of land, especially around the capitalSome of 53 countries studied also have highest sense of \u0026lsquolife satisfaction\u0026rsquo in worldHome Office denies any link with Brexit vote or UK government\u0026rsquos clampdown pledgePolling suggests almost 80 per cent of people think giving storms a name raises awareness\u0026lsquoSignificant proportion of our clients ... struggle to meet rising housing costs on limited means\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3626631.1536745702!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"plan to turn dublin s mountjoy square into visitor attraction revealed","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            A computer-generated image of the proposed Mountjoy Square Park redevelopment.

Image: Dublin City Council reportDublin City Council has proposed restoring Mountjoy Square to how it looked on opening in 1837 by re-creating the 4.4-acre park at its centre.The square does not play a significant role in Dublin’s tourism, despite its city centre location, and there are few reasons to visit it, a new report has concluded. Moreover, a public consultation found concerns over antisocial activity in Mountjoy Square Park, especially relating to alcohol and drugs. The council report has concluded the park has” greater potential” to contribute to the city and the local area. “It is a park that needs vision and investment to realise its potential in revitalising this area of the inner city,” the report said.The planned centrepiece would be a lawn nearly an acre in size and big enough to allow games such as football and frisbee. Planting around the central lawn will form large beds with mown grass margins. These planting beds will be themed on the concept of plant hunting that saw many new species introducted from the Georgian period onward. Plant hunters in the Georgian and Victorian eras included horticulturalists and botanists who explored remote parts of the world in search of new species to record and bring back to Europe for propagation and commercial sale.The plan envisages the removal of 33 trees in a “dead-poor condition”. Their removal will facilitate the main path in the park.A circular path is proposed around the perimeter of the central lawn with a possible jogging path on the perimeter of the square. Mountjoy Square is one of Dublin’s five historic Georgian squares and was developed by the Gardiner family in the late 1700s. It was compared at the time to some of London’s best squares, but the original design has been eroded over the years. Its association with the playwright Sean O’Casey - he lived in a tenement flat at No 35 - will be reflected in the proposal to inscribe extracts of his work on stone edging around the perimeter walk of the central lawn. The poets WB Yeats and Patrick Pearse are also linked to Mountjoy Square, and their contributions will be explored in the plan. Parts of the playground in Mountjoy Square Park will be closed for building of the new path. In the longer term it is intended to replace the playground with a new facility in the restored original plan for the park. The ultimate goal will be to upgrade the status of Mountjoy Squre Park from a ‘community grade 1’ park with a good range of uses to a ‘flagship’ park that would be a significant visitor attraction. The report arose out of a decision by Dublin City Council in 2012 to designate Mountjoy Square as an architectural conservation area. The full report can be read here.

Photograph: Will OliverEPAA record number of citizens from European Union member states were detained on immigration grounds and deported from Northern Ireland in 2016, the year of the Brexit referendum.UK Home Office figures obtained by Belfast-based website The Detail show 161 EU nationals were detained at Larne House, Northern Ireland’s only immigration detention centre, during 2016.The facility, about 30km north of Belfast, can hold iniduals for up to seven days before they are transferred to long-term detention centres in Scotland or England and are then deported, released on bail, or permitted to remain in the UK.Of the 161 EU citizens detained at Larne House in 2016, the Home Office indicated 92 per cent were deported or removed to their home countries, 5 per cent were bailed or placed under immigration restrictions and 3 per cent were allowed to remain in the UK.Only 15 EU nationals were held there in 2012 – the first full year for which detention data for the short-term holding facility is available. The proportion of EU citizens held at Larne House rose from one in 12 of all iniduals detained in 2014 to one in four in 2016. The most recent data available shows 69 people were detained there in the first six months of 2018.The significant increase in the detention and deportation of EU citizens in 2016 coincided with a UK government pledge to clamp down on immigration as part of its Brexit campaign. Immigration control and enforcement is not a devolved matter.The Home Office said the 2016 spike was not Brexit-related but stemmed from a rise in EU nationals with criminal records being intercepted on sea and air routes into Northern Ireland. A spokesperson told The Detail: “The 73 per cent increase in EU citizens detained in Northern Ireland in 2016 is largely down to a corresponding rise (71 per cent) that year in the number of foreign national criminals intercepted by Immigration Enforcement attempting to abuse the Common Travel Area (CTA) to avoid detection at a UK port. Brexit had no bearing whatsoever on the increase.”However, Larne House Visitor Group, a group of volunteers who offer support to people detained on immigration grounds, said reasons given by the Home Office for deportation were varied and often less than clear: “It could be a previous conviction in the EU national’s home country or for serving a short sentence for a petty crime committed in the UK. But we’ve also seen a case where a speeding ticket was being used as justification to deport an inidual and there have been other examples where iniduals faced arrest when re-entering the UK for reasons that were not entirely clear.”Home Office figures also show that the majority (77 per cent) of EU nationals detained in Northern Ireland between 2011 and mid-2018 came from three member states: Romania, Lithuania and Poland.Since July 2011, when Larne House opened, more than 4,000 people from across the globe have been detained there.Across the UK, detention rates have increased fivefold since the now prime minister, Theresa May, took the helm of the Home Office in 2010. The detention of EU citizens across the UK increased from 1,013 in 2010 to 5,319 in 2017."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3626735.1536754452!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tory brexiteers claim technology can keep border open","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJacob Rees-Mogg said the paper sought to address the Border issue from the point of view of the EU’s need to maintain the integrity of the single market.  File photograph: Dan KitwoodGetty ImagesThe Border can remain open after Brexit through the use of technology and by modifying existing arrangements, the European Research Group (ERG) of Conservative Brexiteers has claimed. In a report published in London on Wednesday, the group says that the issue of the Border has been allowed to frame negotiations over Brexit.“The key obstacle in the negotiations is the EU’s concern that goods could enter into the single market area through the Irish Border without being compliant with EU standards or tariffs. The question for the EU is whether this risk to the integrity of the single market is so serious that it could block a free trade agreement with the UK,” it says.The position paper was introduced by ERG chairman Jacob Rees-Mogg with a panel including former Brexit secretary David Davis, former Northern Ireland secretaries Theresa Villiers and Owen Patterson and former Northern Ireland first minister David Trimble.It suggests that customs, VAT, product compliance and rules of origin checks could be conducted away from the Border, using trusted trader schemes and simplified procedures for declarations. It acknowledges that the island of Ireland should remain a common biosecurity zone, which would mean that current animal and plant health checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland would be maintained.“Such measures can ensure that the trade across the Irish border is maintained. The EU will be able to maintain the integrity of its internal market without erecting a hard border along its border with Northern Ireland. At the same time, the United Kingdom will be able to develop a fully independent trade policy rather than remaining a rule-taker. The one element of ‘alignment’ necessary is the maintenance of the current common biosecurity zone covering the island of Ireland, and this is not contentious,” the paper says.Mr Rees-Mogg said the paper sought to address the Border issue from the point of view of the EU’s need to maintain the integrity of the single market and Mr Davis said it was aimed at unlocking the negotiations.“This is a fabulously practical and sensible approach to this. The only way we are going to resolve this issue and unlock the negotiation is by engaging on a practical level with these proposals in a way that the Union has not yet done,” Mr Davis said.But the proposals fall far short of what the EU and Ireland have demanded in a Border backstop based on the joint report agreed between the EU and Britain last December.That report said that, unless another solution is found, Northern Ireland must remain aligned with the rules of the single market and the customs union that support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy and the Belfast agreement. Mr Davis said he interpreted that commitment as referring to alignment of outcomes rather than of rules.\u0026nbspThe DUP’s leader at Westminster Nigel Dodds endorsed the proposals as a “positive and timely” development.“The paper makes clear that in the event of a free trade deal being negotiated with the EU there are sensible, practical measures which can ensure they will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic,” he said.The report was published a day after ERG members were reported to have devoted their weekly meeting on Tuesday evening to discussing how and when to push Theresa May out of office but Mr Rees-Mogg and Mr Davis both insisted on Wednesday that she had their full support.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It\u0027s not required, so a parent can either give consent for us to use that as a disciplinary measure, or they can deny consent.He added that he expected the punishment to serve as a deterrent.The policy specifies that the paddle will be no more than 24 inches in length, six inches in width and three-quarters of an inch in thickness.Smacking ban legislation tabled at HolyroodA maximum of three licks will be applied.The student will be taken to an office behind closed doors,” it continues. “The student will place their hands on their knees or piece of furniture and will be struck on the buttocks with a paddle.The legality of corporal punishment was tested at the Supreme Court which ruled in 1977 that the practice was constitutional.That left states to choose their own policy. New Mexico was the most recent state to ban the beating of children in schools, enacting legislation in 2011.A federal study in 2014 found that one child is hit in public school an average of every 30 seconds somewhere in the United States.Some school districts set strict standards, banning bodily injury, for example, while others do not.Jean-Claude Juncker calls on EU to champion euro as a global currencyVaccine fails to protect elderly from killer flu  Pair convicted over \u0026#39terrifying\u0026#39 £500,000 armed robbery at Gleneagles HotelNine year old attacked after refusing to stand for Australian anthem because it\u0026#39s for \u0026#39white people\u0026#39Lynette Dawson: Australian police dig for remains of missing woman in \u0026#39Teacher\u0026#39s Pet\u0026#39 casePakistan\u0026#39s female vaccinating team moves from polio to measlesArchbishop of Canterbury: Gig economy and zero hours contracts \u0026#39the reincarnation of an ancient evil\u0026#39Could the ERG bring down Theresa May?

The most severe punishment under the Article 7 procedure is stripping the country of its voting rights in the EU, however, that is highly unlikely to happen as the rest of the EU needs unanimity and Poland\u0027s nationalist and anti-immigration government is expected to block any tough action against Orban. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, echoing Orban\u0027s longtime position, called the result petty revenge against Hungary for its tough anti-migration policies.He also claimed that the vote involved massive fraud since abstentions weren\u0027t counted into the final tally, which made it easier to reach the needed majority.There were 48 abstentions, so the 448 in favor exceeded the two-thirds needed only because it was based on 645 votes. If the abstentions were counted into the final tally, there would have been a total 693 votes, so the 448 in favor wouldn\u0027t have reached two-thirds.Szijjarto said Hungary was considering legal options to appeal the result because of the way the vote was tallied.But Judith Sargentini, who presented the report prepared by the European Parliament\u0027s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, welcomed the outcome.Viktor Orban\u0027s government has been leading the charge against European values by silencing independent media, replacing critical judges, and putting academia on a leash, Sargentini said. The Hungarian people deserve better. They deserve freedom of speech, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice and equality, all of which are enshrined in the European treaties.This is a historic result for Hungarian citizens and for European citizens everywhere, that the European Parliament has voted by a large majority to stand up for the values we all hold dear, Sargentini said.The move saw some members of the European People\u0027s Party bloc - of which Orban\u0027s Fidesz movement is a member - vote against their ally in Budapest.Even EPP leader Mandred Weber, who earlier was supportive of Orban and is seeking to become the European Commission president next year, said he had voted for triggering Article 7.I have always been in favor of building bridges and I want to continue to do so, but yesterday (Tuesday) I didn\u0027t see any readiness from the Hungarian PM to make a move towards his EU partners and address our concerns, Manfred tweeted.Orban has for years deflected much of the international condemnation of Hungary\u0027s electoral system, media freedoms, independence of the judiciary, mistreatment of asylum-seekers and refugees and limits on the functioning of non-governmental organizations.While Weber had called on Orban to show a willingness to compromise on some of the most high-profile issues - like an agreement being delayed by the Hungarian government for the Central European University, founded by George Soros, Orban\u0027s ideological opponent, to remain in Budapest and recent laws criminalizing the work of civic groups working with asylum-seekers and refugees - Orban remained steadfast that his policies wouldn\u0027t change.I have nothing to compromise about since the questions they objected to were decided by the Hungarian people, Orban said Tuesday in Strasbourg, France, after the debate in the European Parliament on the report on Hungary. There is nothing to talk about.Orban has insisted that all of the criticism against his government is based on Hungary\u0027s tough anti-immigration policies, which include fences built in 2015 on Hungary\u0027s southern borders with Serbian and Croatia to ert the flow of migrants and very restrictive asylum rules. He has also expressed his desire to remain within the EPP, which he said was deeply ided on the issue of migration.Please review our commenting policyVaccine fails to protect elderly from killer flu  Pair convicted over \u0026#39terrifying\u0026#39 £500,000 armed robbery at Gleneagles HotelNine year old attacked after refusing to stand for Australian anthem because it\u0026#39s for \u0026#39white people\u0026#39Lynette Dawson: Australian police dig for remains of missing woman in \u0026#39Teacher\u0026#39s Pet\u0026#39 casePakistan\u0026#39s female vaccinating team moves from polio to measlesArchbishop of Canterbury: Gig economy and zero hours contracts \u0026#39the reincarnation of an ancient evil\u0026#39Could the ERG bring down Theresa May?

These are from a crop that includes the names Callum, Deirdre, Kevin Violet and Tristan.It is the fourth year that the Met Office and Met Eireann have run the Name our Storms scheme, which aims to raise awareness of severe weather before it hits, and mimics the system used by the US National Hurricane Centre in the 1970s.The selection of Idris follows a year in which the actor, famous for his roles in The Wire and Luther, directed his first film, became engaged to his girlfriend and stepped into the DJ booth at the afterparty of Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle.The actor sparked fevered speculation that he had been offered the role of James Bond in August after he posted the cryptic tweet: My name\u0027s Elba, Idris Elba.However, he later sought to dampen speculation he would become the first black 007, and is currently second favourite behind Tom Hardy with most bookmakers.Storm Emma helped bring severe wintry weather to much of the country in MarchThe new Met Office list is notable for its size, being more than double the length of that announced this time last year, since when there have been ten named events, starting with Storm Aileen which struck on September 12, and culminating in Storm Hector, which occured on June 13.The system of naming what critics have described as “winter gales” has been controversial, particularly when whether that was not deemed severe was named and visa versa. But Derrick Ryall, head of public weather services at the Met Office, said: Naming storms has been proved to raise awareness of severe weather in the UK, providing a consistent message to the public and crucially prompting people to take action to prevent harm to themselves or to their property.Evelyn Cusack, head of forecasting at Met Eireann, said: The last 12 months have seen some extreme weather around the globe as well as here at home. While it is too early to say whether the coming winter will be a stormy one or a quiet one we are prepared with a whole new set of 21 names for whatever nature may throw at us.As before, Met Eireann forecasters will work in close co-operation with our colleagues from the Met Office in the UK to keep all the peoples of these islands warned of impending severe weather.Please review our commenting policyComment: As a former \u0026#39plotter\u0026#39, this doesn\u0026#39t smell like a real coup against Theresa MayJean-Claude Juncker calls on EU to champion euro as a global currencyVaccine fails to protect elderly from killer flu  Pair convicted over \u0026#39terrifying\u0026#39 £500,000 armed robbery at Gleneagles HotelNine year old attacked after refusing to stand for Australian anthem because it\u0026#39s for \u0026#39white people\u0026#39Lynette Dawson: Australian police dig for remains of missing woman in \u0026#39Teacher\u0026#39s Pet\u0026#39 casePakistan\u0026#39s female vaccinating team moves from polio to measlesArchbishop of Canterbury: Gig economy and zero hours contracts \u0026#39the reincarnation of an ancient evil\u0026#39Could the ERG bring down Theresa May?

Polio cases have fallen from 306 in 2014 to only four so far in 2018.While Pakistan still has the polio virus circulating in the environment and has some time to go before it is declared polio free, health officials are starting to look at other potential uses of the network they have put in place.One of the most successful parts of the anti-polio campaign has been the recruitment of tens of thousands of largely female community-based volunteers who vaccinate children in their own neighbourhoods..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}These people really understand the population they are surveyingDr Rana SafdarThe tactic was instrumental in overcoming distrust of vaccination, amid conspiracy theories that the drops were harmful, or even a Western plot to sterilise Muslims. The polio eradication campaign involves door-to-door mass vaccinations several times a year.Over time the workers have built up invaluable trust with the local people and knowledge of the children in their areas, said Dr Rana Safdar, coordinator of the national Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) for polio eradication.He said: “These people really understand the population they are surveying. We are at a stage where we can make use of this intervention for broader service delivery on a number of accounts.”The volunteers are already involved in routine immunisation for diseases other than polio and have increased coverage rates, but in mid-October will be used for the first time for a nationwide, 12-day measles campaign.While Pakistan\u0027s high profile polio campaign is hailed for its recent success, efforts against measles have faltered and cases more than doubled last year.World Health Organisation standards suggest 95 per cent coverage is needed to prevent an outbreak, but Pakistan has routine immunisation rates of 68 per cent.Measles immunisations are not carried out door-to-door, but community teams will use their neighbourhood knowledge to mobilise families to take their children for injections at health centres.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Vaccine fails to protect elderly from killer flu  Pair convicted over \u0026#39terrifying\u0026#39 £500,000 armed robbery at Gleneagles HotelNine year old attacked after refusing to stand for Australian anthem because it\u0026#39s for \u0026#39white people\u0026#39Lynette Dawson: Australian police dig for remains of missing woman in \u0026#39Teacher\u0026#39s Pet\u0026#39 caseArchbishop of Canterbury: Gig economy and zero hours contracts \u0026#39the reincarnation of an ancient evil\u0026#39Could the ERG bring down Theresa May?

One of them will be much larger – probably the biggest display that Apple has ever put in a phone –\u0026nbspwhile another will give access to the iPhone X\u0027s design at a relatively cheaper price.Many details about that new phone, including its shiny gold colour, has already been accidentally leaked by Apple.But it might not be the iPhone that is actually the most interesting thing revealed at the event. Lots more is expected, too, including huge updates to the Apple Watch and long-awaited new accessories.That new Apple Watch was also leaked during the event, and shows the first re-design of the wearable since it was released.Despite all that, the most interesting thing could be what Apple\u0026nbspdoesn\u0027t\u0026nbspsay during the event. Plenty of rumours are swirling around the company that it has yet to address, and perhaps the most important thing will be the ways that it continues to do so.Worth remembering that even if you don\u0027t want to buy any of the new products today, all (relatively modern) iPhones are going to get an upgrade probably more profound than any of the new features that Apple has unveiled. That will come with iOS 12 – the performance-focused, mindfulness-promoting new update that will come out in the coming days, ready for the new phone.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s everything you need to know about the new features that will be arriving, entirely for free.Apple\u0026nbspappears to have leaked just about every product it has coming. There\u0027s limited details one each of them – but some important ones.The Apple Store is DOWN. You won\u0027t be able to buy anything for the next eight hours or so, at which point it will come back online – with all the new phones and everything else there.New pictures of the Sim trays from the upcoming phones have been revealed, showing the colours that they might come in. And they look... a little strange?Here\u0027s a little more on that super expensive iPhone – which could be made even more expensive as a result of Donald Trump.The iPhone XS Max might be the most interesting part of the new line-up, at least if you\u0027re in the market for showing off.\u0026nbspFirst, it will literally be the biggest phone Apple has ever made, or at least the biggest display. It\u0027s rumoured to be 6.5-inches – by comparison, the current Plus-sized phones are a mere 5.5-inches.\u0026nbspBut it might also be the most expensive phone that it has ever made, too. The iPhone X already took that record when it breached the £999 mark last year it makes sense that this is the new normal, and that the price is likely to stay the same. If that\u0027s the case then the bigger phone will also be more expensive: could the one with more memory be the first to cost over £1,500?Just over a day to go now, and the leaks continue to flow. Here\u0027s the latest suggestion: the iPhone 9 (that is, the cheaper and middle-sized version) might be short in supply, at least at first. But it\u0027s still probably going to be the one most people buy.\u0026nbspRead the full report here.Please allow a moment for the live blog to load.Apple is unveiling not just one iPhone, but three – including the biggest and most expensive one ever.

Anything you want to publish will need to first be approved by these filters, perfectly legal content like parodies \u0026amp memes will be caught in the crosshairs, she wrote on Twitter.Article 11 introduces a so-called link tax. That will mean that companies like Google and Facebook could have to pay news organisations to use their headlines on their sites, for instance, which campaigners claim could undermine some of the most central technologies of the internet.All of the rules have received sustained critiicsm from both the big technology platforms as well as internet campaigners. But they have been supported by the big companies in the media industries, as well as some of their biggest stars including musicians like Paul McCartney.But some musicians argued that the rules could actually hurt their industry, by stifling the ability to collaborate.Musicians and artists thrive when they collaborate and share, said Wyclef Jean, who is in Strasbourg arguing against the rules.\u0026nbspI’ve worked with so many young artists – the future – who have sampled my music and succeeded. Upload filters or anything else that restricts this will stop artists from making and creating the future.The rules will now progress through the rest of the legislative process, which will include a final vote in January, which is likely to see the rules passed. EU members will then choose how to enforce the directive in their own laws.The new version of the rules included hundreds of changes that have been made since the parliament rejected them in July, such as allowing exemptions for the very smallest tech companies. But campaigners argue the substance of the new directive is the same, including the parts referred to as a link tax and the controversial automated filters.Apple is unveiling not just one iPhone, but three – including the biggest and most expensive one ever.

With the gang having grappled with the devilishly difficult showstopper (korovai, a traditional bread in Eastern Europe that’s mainly associated with weddings), we look back at all the talking points from the episode.Terry, the comeback kid?Terry has been this year’s most inconsistent contestant so far. One minute, the wonderfully moustachioed man will be struggling with Chelsea buns that he’s forgotten to fill with sugar the next, he’s brimming with confidence as he takes home the technical challenge trophy. Come the showstopper, the 56-year-old was fumbling around, his bread painfully stuck to the tin. Will his next bake be another impressionist masterpiece redolent of his first week glory? Or another soggy-bottomed bun? It’s anyone’s guess, but this week was certainly an improvement on last.Born in India, Rahul moved to the UK aged 23 on a university scholarship. Now living in Rotherham, he hopes his East-meets-West style of cooking will win over the judges.Born in Belgium, Kim-Joy has an English mother and Malaysian-Chinese father, saying her heritage is reflected in her baking. She now lives in Leeds and applied for the competition to boost her confidence. 312 Luke, 30, Civil servantHouse and Techno DJHailing from Sheffield, Luke has been cooking since he was just 10 and wants to put those 20 years of experience to good use. Coming from Northern Ireland, Imelda\u0027s mother taught her to cook. Dan decided to apply for Bake Off for selfish reasons. He says: \u0027I\u0027ve been at home looking after the kids for the last six years, so it was a chance to do something for myself. With my youngest starting school, I\u0027m now ready to rejoin the world of adults.Ruby grew up in an Indian family and now lives in London. Inspired by her mother\u0027s Indian sweets, she makes cakes, pastries and boozy treats for her friends to enjoy.The self-described Bollywood baker learnt to Bake with his father. Now living in London, he says: My friends back home in India will be really surprised. They have known me to be a singer in a choir, a two-piece band but never as a baker, so it will be interesting to see their reaction.Briony, who comes from Bristol, learnt her baking skills from YouTube tutorials. Terry will be bringing items from his microbrewery and allotment with him to the Bake Off tent, hoping they give him that winning edge.The father of four says: \u0027I bake as often as I can, several times a week, mainly in the day while my wife and children are at school as I get some peace that way! The tent is far easier than my kitchen.Having moved from France to England, Manon says: When me and my best friend came to England, Bake Off was one of the first shows we watched together on TV. My closest girlfriends have always rooted for me and supported me throughout my baking journey.Karen developed a love for baking after buying a house in France 15 years ago. She was encouraged to go on the show by her daughter: I want to be more free and flamboyant. I really want to do this for me and I thought it was the right time to step up and have fun.Born in India, Rahul moved to the UK aged 23 on a university scholarship.

And Paul’s all-black outfit may have given the impression that he’s actually a former bouncer who has retired to Ibiza. But Karen stole the show with her red beret, pointed glasses and vibrant shirts, giving grandmas around the country some pointers in sartorial eccentricity. In conjunction with her wit (“That bread’s better looking than my husband”) she’s already won the heart of the nation. Oh, and we still haven’t seen Jon out of a Hawaiian shirt.Time is of the essenceNo matter the length of a challenge, Bake Off’s producers make every hurdle seems as stressful as the last. Compare this week’s technical challenge and the showstopper. The first was an hour-long bake that saw everyone panic as their naans failed to blow up properly. Conversely, the korovai was a five-hour struggle to amass as much bread as possible. Would we have known how long everyone had spent slaving over their bakes if they hadn’t told us multiple times? Probably not. Either way, it made for some tense television.“Feels like mine’s pretty average,” says Dan, looking at his gloopy dough, pondering whether to let it bake longer. Yet, for two weeks running, Dan has received the famous Paul Hollywood handshake, this time for his impressive buns. The full-time parent has quickly become a frontrunner for the finale, consistently acing almost every challenge. He may not be the most charismatic character, but he’s going to be around a long time.Speaking of frontrunners, last week’s star baker Rahul has come up trumps again. Constantly apologising to everyone and everything around him (“You’re like a breadstick, you’re going to snap,” Noel says), Rahul remains the competition’s most adorable contestant and no doubt has a thousand cookbook publishers waiting to sign him.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/08/21/pa-22100396.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1875  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/08/21/pa-22100396.jpg","title":"monkeypox virus nigeria africa lethal symptoms infection cornwall blackpool spreading","story":"Created with Sketch.Nigerian outbreak in 2017 has left pockets of disease which \u0027could affect travellers\u0027Click to followThe IndependentMonkeypox: Second person found with potentially lethal virus days after first ever case in EnglandHealth officials have warned a second person\u0026nbsphas been identified with the rare and potentially life-threatening infection monkeypox, just days after the first ever case in England was identified in Cornwall.The infections are thought to be unrelated and Public Health England (PHE) is trying to contact anyone who might have come into contact with either of the\u0026nbsppatients, who have both recently\u0026nbspvisited Nigeria.The new patient\u0026nbspis believed to have picked up the infection while visiting the country and it was diagnosed at Blackpool Victoria Hospital when they returned home and fell ill.Health officials said\u0026nbspinfection is usually mild and the condition does not spread easily, but\u0026nbspsevere cases can be fatal and the patient has been transferred to a specialist infectious disease unit at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital.“We know that in September 2017 Nigeria experienced a large sustained outbreak of monkeypox and since then sporadic cases have continued to be reported,” said Dr Nick Phin, deputy director of PHE’s\u0026nbspNational Infection Service.“It is likely that monkeypox continues to circulate in Nigeria and could therefore affect travellers who are returning from this part of the world, however, it is very unusual to see two cases in such a relatively short space of time.”Monkeypox: the factsMonkeypox occurs primarily in remote parts of central and west Africa, near tropical rainforests.It is similar to human smallpox, which was eradicated in 1980. Although monkeypox is much milder, it can be fatal.The virus is mostly transmitted to people from wild animals such as primates but can spread from human to human.The fatality rate is between 1 per cent and 10 per cent.Initial symptoms include fever, headache, aching muscles, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.A rash can also develop, usually starting on the face before spreading to other parts of the body. It eventually forms a scab that falls off.Dr Mike Beadsworth, clinical director of the Tropical and Infectious Diseases Unit at the Royal Liverpool\u0026nbspUniversity Hospital, said: “We are treating a patient who has tested positive for monkeypox.“The patient is being cared for on our specialist infectious and tropical diseases unit, by highly trained staff who are experienced in dealing with a variety of infectious diseases.”Over the weekend it was reported that a Nigerian citizen staying at a naval base in Cornwall had been diagnosed with the first ever case of monkeypox in England and PHE was trying to trace other people who may have shared their flight as a precaution. The first case, believed to be a\u0026nbspnaval officer, is being treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London.The disease, which was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has mostly been spread on the\u0026nbspAfrican\u0026nbspcontinent through the handling of infected monkeys, Gambian giant rats and squirrels, with rodents being the most likely source of the virus.Eating inadequately cooked meat from infected animals is another possible risk factor, according to the World Health Organisation.Healthcare staff or people who may have come into contact with either infected person\u0026nbspshould contact PHE\u0026nbspfor health advice.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"iphone launch live updates new event apple xs x watch ipad latest specs stream","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followThe IndependentiPhone and Apple Watch apparently leakedEverything to expect at Apple\u0027s big eventWhy\u0026nbspthe iPhone will be the least interesting part of the eventAnd\u0026nbspwhy the most interesting things might not be there at alliPhone launch – live updates: Apple announces latest handset developments as new products details leak on release dayApple is about to hold its biggest event of the year.The company is going to unveil not just one new version of the iPhone X, but three.

With Theresa May scurrying around the EU trying to deliver Brexit, Greece is\u0026nbspquite right to probe the possibility of bringing the\u0026nbsptreasures homeClick to followThe IndependentThe Elgin Marbles are still one of the most popular displays at the British MuseumIt seems unlikely that several hundred tonnes of marble from Mount Pentelicus near Athens could have a significant role to play in Brexit. But, following a letter from the Greek government to Jeremy Wright,\u0026nbspthe culture secretary, that is exactly what is now happening. Lydia Koniordou, Wright’s Greek counterpart, has asked for dialogue with Britain over the antique sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles.Brought to Britain in the early 1800s by Lord Elgin, the artworks – more properly known as the Parthenon Sculptures – have aroused excitement and controversy ever since. They first went on display in London in 1807, then from 1817 they reached an international audience from a new home in the British Museum. Everyone from Canova to Rodin declared them to be among the most exceptional sculptures ever made. Over two centuries later, they remain one of the British Museum\u0027s most popular displays.Not everyone was happy that Elgin shipped the sculptures to Britain. Lord Byron famously lamented: “Dull is the eye that will not weep to see \u0026nbspThy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed \u0026nbspBy British hands.” But few put his panegyric into context. Byron was a Romantic, who wanted the monumental art of ancient Greek civilisation to crumble poetically as decayed vestiges of lost perfection. He was also making a one-off point rather than speaking from principle, as he personally imported Greek antiquities to Britain and sold them privately.Nevertheless, Byron\u0027s mixed attitudes towards ancient Greece\u0026nbspexpress some of the challenges inherent in questions of cultural heritage, which often see a feverish mix of emotion and romance meet a hard wall of reality.“For me, the Parthenon Sculptures raise some of the biggest questions of cultural property, ownership and where works of art ‘belong’,”\u0026nbspexplains Mary Beard, professor of classics at Cambridge,\u0026nbspThe timing of Greece’s recent letter could not be more significant. Theresa May\u0027s beleaguered strategy to deliver Brexit will ultimately require the consent of all 27\u0026nbspEU members. That means inidual rounds of diplomacy with each country. Greece is taking the opportunity – quite understandably – to probe for a possible quid pro quo, which it hopes will include the Parthenon Sculptures.There have been similar requests from Greece in the past, notably in a campaign by former Greek culture minister Melina Mercouri in the 1980s. However, consecutive British governments have consistently rejected all such requests, although an unexpected door was opened in June when Jeremy Corbyn announced that any government led by him would make it a policy to give the sculptures to Greece.Corbyn\u0027s statement was based on his conviction that the sculptures “belong” to Greece. He referred to them as “stolen” and “looted” by Britain. Many share this view, including members of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles, or BCRPM – one of the key groups formed in the UK to press for the sculptures to be given to Greece.The British government\u0027s view goes back to 1816, when a UK Parliamentary Select Committee interviewed witnesses – including Elgin – who had been in Athens at the time, and concluded that Elgin had obtained all necessary permissions from the Ottoman authorities in Athens to remove the sculptures and transport them to England. The Select Committee then voted, 82 to 30, to acquire the sculptures for the nation, before presenting them to the British Museum for public display, scholarship, enlightenment and enjoyment.In many circles, however, there are misgivings about Britain claiming ownership over antiquities that manifestly were not made in Britain. This feeling is tinged with even more awkwardness as the sculptures were acquired during the age of Empire: a period not known for its cultural sensitivity.However, these are generalities. The Parthenon Sculptures have a well-documented and unique history which sheds important light on the controversy.Around 480BC, Athens was entering its Golden Age. It had finally seen off Persia, and the philosophers and playwrights we revere as the founders of western civilisation were starting to tread its sun-hardened streets.Pericles, the city’s leader from around 461BC, decided to mark the city’s new influence and affluence with a vast building project. One of its highlights was to be a magnificent new temple to Athena the Maiden (Parthenos) built on the Acropolis, the city\u0027s highest hill. To ensure the temple was the envy of all, Pericles commissioned one of the city’s sculptors, Pheidias, to decorate the sacred building with a scheme of sculpture that would transport visitors from earth up onto Mount Olympus itself.The artisans in Pheidias’s workshop hacked and smoothed the white marble until eventually the pieces – once vividly painted – were hoisted up onto the great temple. Onlookers were agog, and anyone looking at the sculptures today will know why. The bodies throb with life. The skin appears warm and real to the touch. The gossamer drapery flows as if in natural motion. And the drama of the scenes is charged with an ethereal tension and electricity that is almost unparalleled in art. There are few major sculptors in the last two hundred years who have not looked on them and felt cowed.Once the classical world of mercurial gods and goddesses faded and the era of Christianity dawned, the sculptures began to suffer. Around AD500, the citizens of Athens defaced many and hacked off others in order to convert the Parthenon into a church. This systematic iconoclasm was the single largest act of destruction in the sculptures\u0027 history. Further damage occurred in 1687 when an invading Venetian force bombarded the Acropolis with mortars and scored a direct hit on the Parthenon, which was being used by the ruling Ottomans as an explosives store.The Ottomans – who had conquered Athens in 1456 – are a key player in what was to happen next. In 1799, Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, was appointed Britain’s ambassador to the “Sublime Porte” of the Ottoman Empire at Constantinople. According to some sources, inspired to allow the people and artists of Europe to enjoy the wonders of ancient Greek art, Elgin spent his own money on commissioning artists and sculptors to draw, paint and take casts of the Parthenon Sculptures and other statuary and stonework in Athens.When Elgin\u0027s men arrived in Athens, they found the Ottomans had turned the Acropolis into a military garrison, and soldiers were using the sculptures on the Parthenon for firearms target practice, and hacking bits off to sell to the growing throngs of tourists on the Grand Tour. By this time the Parthenon had only around half of the sculptures that Pheidias originally placed there, with many in poor condition. Mary Beard explains: “The Acropolis was then a rather sordid Turkish military base, and it would have been easy to convince oneself – rightly or wrongly – that the sculpture was better off out of there.”Elgin’s men then began overseeing the removal of the sculptures. Over the course of 10 years, they used local labourers to take down around half of the sculptures on the building (a quarter of the originals), which Elgin shipped back to Britain.Those\u0026nbsp10 years, 1800-10, lie at the heart of the whole Elgin controversy. Opinions ide. Some say Elgin was a hero and conservator who saved the sculptures for the world. Others, like Paul Cartledge, professor of Greek Culture emeritus at Cambridge, differ: “I believe,” he says, “Elgin had purely self-aggrandising reasons for seeking to acquire – for himself and his own personal display – as many of the Marbles as he could.”The 1816 UK Parliamentary select committee concluded otherwise. After examining witnesses and records, it noted that in 1801 Elgin had obtained a firman – an Ottoman legal permit – which, according to a translation shown to them, permitted Elgin to make drawings, create casts and take away “any pieces of stone with inscriptions or figures”.The BCRPM and other reunificationists stress that Parliament did not see the original firman, and so the permit\u0027s specific terms remain unknown. Moreover, they say, even the translated version does not explicitly envisage the wholesale removal of so much sculpture. Elgin was, they say, guilty of mission creep.Whichever view is right, another angle to the question is that Elgin, as ambassador, had the power of the British state behind him. Britain had just defeated Napoleon, who was also an enemy of the Ottomans. Britain was therefore in good odour at the Ottoman court, and Elgin was in a position to ask for favours. “Elgin,” Paul Cartledge believes, “certainly unquestionably exploited the fraught international situation c. 1800, whereby Britain was the enemy of the Ottoman Sultan\u0027s (French) enemy and therefore the Sultan\u0027s ‘friend’.”Those who view Elgin in a more kindly light point to the fact all this removal work was not done covertly or surreptitiously. It was carried out over a period of 10 years, in broad daylight, in central Athens, using hundreds of Greek labourers, under the noses of the authorities, and was even revalidated by a second firman in 1810 when the work was complete and French diplomats tried to hold up the last shipment\u0026nbsp(the French were hoping that they might get some of the sculptures for the Louvre).\u0026nbspThis leads to one of the central disagreements in the whole debate. Greece – aided by allies, including Britain and British philhellenes who had been inspired by seeing the Parthenon Sculptures in London – overthrew the Ottomans in 1832 and restored Greek government. The BCRPM therefore asks how the Ottomans can have given Elgin valid authority to remove the sculptures when they were an illegitimate occupying power.However, the lawyers don’t see it this way. When the Greek government instructed Amal Clooney and Geoffrey Robertson to advise them in 2014, the Syriza government eventually decided that the route to gaining the sculptures was political and diplomatic rather than legal. This came as a surprise to no one. In 1985, Professor John Henry Merryman of Stanford Law School, a leading authority on cultural property, examined the case for restitution and concluded that the modern state of Greece had no legal, moral, or ethical claim to the sculptures.Archaeological treasures of Ancient GreeceThis golden death mask was discovered in the ruins of ancient Mycenae in 1876 by Heinrich Schliemann after he went looking for the palace of Agamemnon, a central figure in the Trojan War.

The figures’ heads are in AthensA wall painting from a house in Akrotiri, Santorini, which was covered with ash from a volcanic eruption in about 1,500BC. It shows swallows swooping among clusters of red lilliesOne of the reasons for this is that by the time Elgin’s men arrived in Athens in 1800, the Ottomans had ruled Greece for almost 350 years. Countries are forever changing hands, and the Ottomans were, in fact and law, the internationally recognised government of the day. Who else, many ask, should or could Elgin have requested for permission to remove the sculptures to safety?When Elgin got back to Britain, he was suffering from catastrophic debt. He estimated he had spent around £73,600\u0026nbsp(around £3.5m in today’s money) bringing the sculptures to Britain. Parliament offered him £35,000 for the lot, which he accepted. The sculptures went to the British Museum. “It is a myth that Elgin profited hugely from \u0027getting\u0027 the marbles,” Mary Beard explains. “His wife walked out, and he faced bankruptcy, which prompted the sale to the government.” Elgin moved to France, where he died, broken and bankrupt.Once on display in London, the sculptures caused a sensation and started waves of fashion for Greek art and civilisation. “The marbles in London were a vital catalyst for 19th-century Europe\u0027s passion for Greek culture,” explains Dr Greg Sullivan, a leading sculpture historian. “The marbles got into the bloodstream of contemporary 19th-century art. If you attended the Royal Academy art schools or the Derby Mechanics Institute, or if you visited Oxford, Cambridge or Wisbech art galleries, you would be greeted with copies of the statues or casts from the Parthenon frieze.“Flaxman, Westmacott, Gibson, Chantrey. Leighton and Alma-Tadema all acknowledged their influence. It demonstrates how passion for European culture has been a key part of Britishness for centuries, Plaster casts by the British artists Westmacott and Brucciani were given or sold all over Europe to courts and art schools in Germany, Italy, Spain and elsewhere, accelerating the passion for Hellenic civilization. Henning’s miniature relief copies of the frieze were sold and pirated in Paris, Rome, Munich and Vienna.”The sculptures Elgin left in Athens did not fare well. Pollution from the oil refinery at nearby Eleusis eroded many into furry vestiges of their former glories, and a restoration from 1895-1933 by Nicholaos Balanos stapled the sculptures with iron bars which expanded, shattering sections of marble. Fortunately, the casts commissioned by Elgin preserved the details of these sculptures, and have enabled replicas to be made. The British Museum also came in for criticism for an overly abrasive cleaning program in the late 1930s, when it was fashionable to make antique sculptures gleam bright white. However, it was nothing that was not being done at the time to artefacts all over the world, including in Greece. The British Museum subsequently conducted a full investigation, held a conference, and published all results.Looking at all the evidence, Mary Beard concludes: “We must not turn a blind eye to all the problems here, but we should put them in their historical context, without whitewashing or demonising Elgin.”The Elgin Marbles controversy does not, of course, begin and end with Elgin and the wording of his permits. A broader question – which is an increasingly important one – transcends the legal technicalities and asks whether an increasingly culturally sensitive world should be engaging in a general amnesty of cultural artefacts.It is now a real question whether museums should – as a moral act – send objects to the places they were made.\u0026nbspThere can be strong arguments in favour. Some were looted in war. Some would bring tourism to their home regions. Some have ongoing cultural meaning. “To me, the legality of the matter is the least important thing,” says Paul\u0026nbspCartledge. “We don\u0027t actually know what the Sultan\u0027s firman actually permitted Elgin to do. The most important thing is to see what remains of the sculptures – from the British Museum and elsewhere – reunified where they properly can be best appreciated, in the New Acropolis Museum of Athens.”However, against this view is the inevitable sense of loss the world would feel if its principal museums were emptied out. These great “encyclopaedic” or “universal” museums – largely products of the age of Enlightenment – offer a unique opportunity for everyone to experience the interrelationship of all things. In these museums\u0027 vast collections – in Paris, Berlin, St Petersburg, London, Athens and elsewhere – visitors gaze into other cultures, not just into a reflection of their own. They are museums of humanity.Dr Tiffany Jenkins, expert in museums and cultural property, sees strong reasons for artefacts remaining spread around the globe. “The question we should ask is, where is best for the object, in terms of truth, access and preservation? The present situation – where half the remaining sculptures are in Athens and the rest are in London – is a good one. It means the marbles can be seen and understood both in Athens, in the Acropolis Museum close to where they were created, and in London, where they are placed within a universal collection of artefacts from multiple human civilisations.” It is a powerful alternative vision to the idea of restitution, aimed at promoting a wider appreciation of the sculptures.” Jenkins continues: “Like time machines, these museums provide historical context and cross-cultural insight.”The idea of returning objects to their place of origin can also be a challenge if history has moved on. Greece, for instance, did not exist when Pheidias made the sculptures. The Parthenon was a resolutely Athenian project, with the temple used as a treasury for protection money Athens collected from the other Greek city states in the Delian League. Dr James Campbell, fellow in art history and architecture at Cambridge, notes: “It is worth remembering that the Parthenon itself was built on the proceeds of war and taxation and came to be seen by many parts of the Greek world as a symbol of Athenian oppression. It was filled with goods stolen and looted from other cultures.” The Delian League evoked such resentment that it prompted a civil war in which Sparta supplanted Athens as most influential power in the region. So although Greece is unarguably the place where the sculptures were made, they were never a symbol of Greek unity, ancient or modern.“Throughout history, goods have passed across borders and moved from one place to another. Much art fits into this category,”\u0026nbspCampbell continues.\u0026nbsp“Our galleries are full of Italian Masters, Dutch landscapes, French Impressionists. No one is suggesting that every Italian Master belongs to the Italian government. Why, then, do we think the Elgin Marbles belong to the Greek government? Or indeed that the Elgin marbles should be swapped for a better Brexit deal?”Allied to the question of geographical heritage is yet another, more philosophical, perspective. It asks what an object is, and whether an artefact can have more than one identity or tell more than one story. Seen this way, Pheidias\u0027s carvings are simultaneously the Parthenon Sculptures and the Elgin Marbles, and who is to say that both stories should not be told?Dr Tiffany Jenkins elaborates further. “The sculptures have been discarded as well as venerated, seen as historical documents as well as artworks. In the early 19th-century, the Royal Academician Ozias Humphrey, thought them a\u0026nbsp‘mass of ruins’. Most recently at the British Museum they were the centrepiece of a superb exhibition that shed light on the sculpture of Auguste Rodin.”The future of the Parthenon Sculptures is undeniably a decision for Parliament. The British Museum is governed by statute and has no power to give away objects in its collection unless they are duplicates or unfit for retention. Museums also have little interest in the heated and politicised aspects to these debates. On a day-to-day level, museum curators in London, Athens and around the world share with each other and with the public their research, knowledge and an overwhelming love for the objects they care for.16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)North Korea displays ice sculptures of ballistic missileHowever, as the recent Greek overture for negotiations shows, one day Parliament may be called upon to make a decision in the case of the sculptures, and perhaps that day will be soon. But the complex, multidimensional questions raised by the Parthenon Sculptures will need to be appreciated in all their shades and nuances. It will simply not do, as Corbyn has done, to fire from the hip and label them as “stolen” property. Neither can the consequences for universal museums be brushed aside, as if the Parthenon Sculptures go, there will inevitably be calls for a mass resettlement of holdings from across the world.“Today, most school children do not learn Greek,” says James Campbell. “Perhaps the sad reason we are even contemplating giving the contents of the British Museum to the current Greek government is that so few British people understand what the Elgin Marbles are, or care.”Any decision on the future of the Parthenon Sculptures should be a reasoned and responsible one. It is unarguable that more people have seen and fallen in love with Greek sculpture and ancient Greece in the free-to-enter British Museum than in the museum in Athens.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the study1924 Life on Earth appeared hundreds of millions of years earlier than previously thoughtLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars.

Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time.

This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.What they found surprised them. The different types of genetic data they obtained seemed to match very distinct groups of people within the cemetery.Those buried in their finery, surrounded by extravagant grave goods likes swords and shields for men and jewellery for women had genetic\u0026nbspancestry commonly found in modern northern and central Europeans.Meanwhile, those bodies buried without masses of grave goods had genomes that more closely resembled southern Europeans.“This appears to suggest that these particular communities contained a mix of iniduals with different genetic backgrounds, that they were aware of these differences, and that it likely influenced their social identity,” said Professor Patrick Geary of the Institute for Advanced Study, one of the paper’s senior authors.The discovery of these two different groups appears to confirm the theory that the Longobards migrated to the region from central or northern Europe – while the southern population were probably local residents.“Our current results are consistent with the idea of barbarians migrating from north of Danube and east of the Rhine, which would suggest we are observing the invasions previously described by the Romans,” said Dr Krishna Veeramah, a geneticist at Stony Brook University.“It is also likely that social organisation was based around large high-status male biological kinship groups, and these were key to establishing communities following the migration into Italy.”Their analysis found evidence of family relationships stretching back generations, with related iniduals buried together in groups.“It looks like both these cemeteries organised themselves around one or two large groups of biologically related kin, with the vast majority of these iniduals being men,” said Dr Veeramah.Having established a team that covers many disciplines, the researchers want to use their skills to investigate more ancient burial sites and learn about family and social structures from the distant past.“There are thousands of medieval cemeteries out there for us to look at. This is hopefully just the beginning of our work,” said Professor Geary.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/10/09/tesco.jpg","title":"tesco discount shop store lidl aldi new supermarket launch","story":"Created with Sketch.In July the company advertised for staff for a ‘new store format’\u0026nbspin CambridgeshireClick to followThe IndependentSupermarket has had 10 consecutive quarters of sales growthSpeculation is mounting that Tesco will launch a new discount store to compete with rivals\u0026nbspAldi and Lidl.\u0026nbspThe UK’s biggest retailer said it would be “sharing some exciting news” on 19 September at its site at Chatteris in Cambridgeshire.\u0026nbspNo further details were provided but in July the company advertised for staff for a “new store format” in Chatteris, seeking to recruit retail assistants, retail customer service assistants and retail managers.Jamie Oliver is the new face of TescoShopper claims Tesco security guard threw him out for being overweightTesco could open new discount chain in weeks to battle Aldi and LidlCan Tesco’s discounter Jack’s succeed where others have failed?

This a position we have consistently articulated.For too long some have used the border issue, and the political process in Northern Ireland more generally, to try to mould Brexit to their way of thinking or to thwart it altogether.

Officials warned the storm would be “nothing like you’ve ever seen”.Follow updates below. Please allow a moment for the blog to loadWe have plenty of resources to respond, he said.

It\u0027s warning that hurricane force conditions are expected to last for 24 hours once Florence strikes the Carolina coast.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is evaluating the potential vulnerability of nine toxic sites that lie in the path of Hurricane Florence, it has been reported.\u0026nbspThere is a threat of toxic chemicals being released from the so-called Superfund sites along the coasts of North and South Carolina, CNN reported.\u0026nbspThe broadcaster cited an EPA spokesman as saying the agency was closely monitoring the projected path of the storm and that officials were planning their response.\u0026nbspA Superfund site is any area of land contaminated by hazardous material that the EPA deems it necessary to clean up. Once designated or proposed as a Superfund site, the areas are placed on a national priorities list.Farmers in the path of the storm are racing to bring in their harvests before Florence arrives.North Carolina corn farmer Darren Armstrong told Bloomberg News he was scrambling ahead of what may be the worst storm in 64 years hits the state. His family began harvesting their 4,500 acres in mid-August, a couple of weeks late because wet weather had delayed planting. “We’re trying to finish,” he told the news service. “We are probably not going to make it.”By the time the rain starts, roughly three-quarters of his corn should be harvested. Another 700 to 1,000 acres may be left standing, exposed to the belting wind and rain.Meanwhile the National Weather Service has tweeted that today is the last day to prepare for the storm.It said strong winds are expected as early as Thursday morning along the SCNC coasts.It said: \u0027We have two requests for our followers: 1) Share this message. 2) Showtell us how you\u0027re preparing.\u0027A pastor at Hayes Barton United Methodist Church in Raleigh, North Carolina, has offered a special prayer for those in the path of the storm.Some 1,000 energy company workers are preparing to help restore power after Florence hits, according to US media reports.\u0026nbspDuke Energy is sending them, according to 10News WTSP.\u0026nbspThe same company has said operators plan to\u0026nbspbegin shutting down nuclear plants at least two hours before hurricane-force winds arrive.Greetings from Washington DC where residents in the nation\u0027s capital are watching out for a weekend deluge as a result of Florence - though obviously nothing on the scale in the Carolinas.

The house he grew up in was badly damaged by the hurricane. “This house is very sentimental to me - it has been in my family well over 80 years and it means a lot to us.

It’s a good thing that the Red Cross was there to give me some help buying them back so I could keep my business going.” Lorie, a keen viola player, saw his most treasured possession damaged in Hurricane Irma, all he has now is the broken remains. “My house I will build back, but there’s no way that I could replace my instrument, my viola, I cannot replace it. It was just precious, I can still hear it in my mind how it used to sound. I would give anything if I might be able to purchase one again, a used one. It has to be very old and seasoned wood, maybe 30, 40, 50 years old. I’m going to take this one with me to the UK and have it repaired.” 81-year-old Lucia, who had lived in her home for 60 years before it was destroyed by Hurricane Irma, is looking forward to returning to her own home. “When I see the destruction and I see what I had loved so dearly I sit down and I cry. The whole roof went, the shutters, and a brand new washer that I had just bought. I lost all my dining chairs, my living room set and a lot of my clothes, but I’m not worried about that, as long as I could find something to wear. But I saved a few things, maybe some are salvageable or maybe not. My favourite thing that I lost is the deeds to my land.

Guards make clear that visitors are not welcome.Inside, hundreds of ethnic Uighur Muslims spend their days in a high-pressure indoctrination programme, where they are forced to listen to lectures, sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write “self-criticism” essays, according to detainees who have been released.The goal is to rid them of devotion to Islam.Abdusalam Muhemet, 41, said the police detained him for reciting a verse of the Quran at a funeral. After two months in a nearby camp, he and more than 30 others were ordered to renounce their past lives. Mr Muhemet said he went along but quietly seethed.“That was not a place for getting rid of extremism,” he recalled. “That was a place that will breed vengeful feelings and erase Uighur identity.”This camp outside Hotan, an ancient oasis town in the Taklamakan Desert, is one of hundreds that China has built in the past few years. It is part of a campaign of breath-taking scale and ferocity that has swept up hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims for weeks or months of what critics describe as brainwashing, usually without criminal charges.Though limited to China’s western region of Xinjiang, it is the country’s most sweeping internment programme since the Mao era – and the focus of a growing chorus of international criticism.China has sought for decades to restrict the practice of Islam and maintain an iron grip in Xinjiang, a region almost as big as Alaska where more than half the population of 24 million belongs to Muslim ethnic minority groups. Most are Uighurs, whose religion, language and culture, along with a history of independence movements and resistance to Chinese rule, have long unnerved Beijing.After a succession of violent anti-government attacks reached a peak in 2014, Xi Jinping, chief of the Communist Party, sharply escalated the crackdown, orchestrating an unforgiving drive to turn ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities into loyal citizens and supporters of the party.“Xinjiang is in an active period of terrorist activities, intense struggle against separatism and painful intervention to treat this,” Mr Xi told officials, according to reports in the state news media in 2017.In addition to the mass detentions, officials have intensified the use of informers and expanded police surveillance, even installing cameras in some people’s homes.Human rights activists and experts say the campaign has traumatised Uighur society, leaving behind fractured communities and families.“Penetration of everyday life is almost really total now,” said Michael Clarke, an expert on Xinjiang at Australian National University in Canberra, Australia\u0027s capital. “You have ethnic identity, Uighur identity in particular, being singled out as this kind of pathology.”China has categorically denied reports of abuses in Xinjiang. At a meeting of a UN panel in Geneva last month, it said it does not operate re-education camps and described the facilities in question as mild corrective institutions that provide job training.“There is no arbitrary detention,” Hu Lianhe, an official with a role in Xinjiang policy, told the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. “There is no such thing as re-education centres.”World news in picturesParticipants wave flowers as they march past a balcony from where North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong Un was watching, during a mass rally on Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang.

Their accounts were echoed in interviews with more than a dozen Uighurs with relatives who were in the camps or had disappeared, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid government retaliation.The Times also discovered reports online written by teams of Chinese officials who were assigned to monitor families with detained relatives and a 2017 study that said officials in some parts of Xinjiang were indiscriminately sending ethnic Uighurs to the camps to meet numerical quotas.The study, by Qiu Yuanyuan, a scholar at the Xinjiang Party School, where officials are trained, warned that the detentions could backfire and fan radicalism. “Recklessly setting quantitative goals for transformation through education has been erroneously used” in some areas, she wrote. “The targeting is imprecise, and the scope has been expanding.”The Xinjiang government issued “de-radicalisation” rules in 2017 that gave vague authorisation for the camps and many counties now run several of them, according to government documents, including requests for bids from construction companies to build them.In government documents, local officials sometimes liken inmates to patients requiring isolation and emergency intervention.“Anyone infected with an ideological ‘virus’ must be swiftly sent for the ‘residential care’ of transformation-through-education classes before illness arises, a document issued by party officials in Hotan said.The number of Uighurs, as well as Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities, who have been detained in the camps is unclear. Estimates range from several hundred thousand to perhaps one\u0026nbspmillion, with exiled Uighur groups say the number is even higher.China bans \u0027extremist\u0027 Islamic baby names in Muslim provinceThousands protest China\u0027s plans to demolish mosqueChina\u0027s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedInternational community silent as China continues religious crackdownChina \u0027forced Muslims to eat pork and drink alcohol\u0027The Chinese government says it is winning a war against Islamic extremism and separatism, which it blames for attacks that have killed hundreds in recent years. Information about such violence is censored and incomplete, but incidents appear to have fallen off sharply since 2014.Still, many who have emerged from the indoctrination program say it has hardened public attitudes against Beijing.“It was of absolutely no use,” Omurbek Eli, a Kazakh businessman, said of his time held in a camp in 2017. “The outcome will be the opposite. They will become even more resistant to Chinese influence.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/08/qr-code.jpg","title":"china uighur muslims xinjiang province qr codes security crackdown hrw","story":"Created with Sketch.Officials\u0026nbspcollect\u0026nbspbiometric data including DNA and voice samples,\u0026nbspformer residents sayClick to followThe IndependentA government official scans the code outside a home in Xinjiang provinceChina is installing QR codes on the homes of the\u0026nbspUighur\u0026nbspMuslim community in order to get instant access to the personal details of people living there, according to a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW).\u0026nbspThe development comes as part of a mass security crackdown on\u0026nbspminorities in Xinjiang province, the charity said,\u0026nbspwhich includes arbitrary detentions, daily restrictions on religious practice and “forced political indoctrination”.\u0026nbspOfficials reportedly scan the “smart” doorplates with mobile devices before entering homes to monitor the inhabitants.Inside China’s ‘re-education centres’ for Uighur MuslimsChina must ‘immediately’ free Muslims from alleged camps, UN saysChina’s Uighur minority shackled by technology as thousands detainedSophie Richardson, China director at HRW, said: “The Chinese government is committing human rights abuses in Xinjiang on a scale unseen in the country in decades.“The campaign of repression in Xinjiang is a key test of whether the United Nations and concerned governments will sanction an increasingly powerful China to end this abuse.”Authorities claim the codes – which in some locales feature on every home – help with population control and delivery of services.\u0026nbsp“Starting from spring 2017, in every home where one enters there’s a QR code,” one former resident who left Xinjiang, in the far west of the country, told HRW.\u0026nbspFormer residents said authorities are also collecting biometric data, such as DNA and voice samples, when people apply for passports or ID cards,\u0026nbspor during police interrogations.\u0026nbsp“They did take our DNA samples\u0026nbspand iris scans when we applied for the passports,” a middle-aged woman who left Xinjiang last year said. “For those who can read, they read out from a paper but for those who cannot, they said, ‘You can sing a song or tell a story and we will record you’. You aren’t in a position to argue with them.”\u0026nbspShe added people were even forced to walk back and forth at\u0026nbsppolice stations so\u0026nbspofficials\u0026nbspcould record their gait.\u0026nbspThe United Nations human rights panel in August said\u0026nbspChina is believed to be holding up to one\u0026nbspmillion ethnic Uighurs in a secretive system of “internment camps” in Xinjiang, where they undergo political education.Beijing has denied such camps are for “political education”, insisting\u0026nbspinstead they are vocational training centres, part of government initiatives to bolster economic growth and social mobility in the region.China has said\u0026nbspXinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between Uighurs who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority.Uighurs and other Muslims held in the camps are forbidden from using Islamic greetings, must learn Mandarin Chinese and sing propaganda songs, according to former camp detainees interviewed by HRW.People in Xinjiang with relatives living abroad in one of 26 “sensitive countries”, including Kazakhstan, Turkey and Indonesia, have reportedly been targeted by the authorities and are often held for several months, without any formal procedure.World news in picturesAn Indian man makes his way through floodwaters from the overflowing Panchanai River in Siliguri.

We were in a feeding frenzy of 200.I could have made thousands, they work out at about \u0026pound2,000 per fish, maybe more.But I gave half to the people on the boat and kept half for myself. I just ate it with family and friends.It\u0027s the biggest thing I\u0027ve ever caught in the UK. I couldn\u0027t believe it. I couldn\u0027t sleep after - it was a dream come true.The presence of the tuna added a fresh twist to the Anglo-French scallop war last week when two fishermen from France netted 44 of them in the same stretch of water.The three had been fishing off the Minquiers, about 15 miles off the coast of Jersey (Image: PAUL HOWSWNS)The haul angered professional fisherman in Britain as they don\u0027t have a quota to catch them.The French brought the haul ashore at the nearby port of Granville in France to be sold.The continued presence of the tuna has prompt the fishing authorities in Jersey to warn that even hobby anglers shouldn\u0027t target the tuna as they are an endangered species.But Mr Chatfield added: I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a problem with one fisherman catching one fish when the French are trawling and catching 44 in our waters.A spokesman for Jersey\u0027s States Fisheries and Marine Resources said: During the past two weeks, shoals of bluefin tuna (BFT) have been sighted in Jersey waters.BFT are categorised on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List as endangered as they have been heavily overfished across their range.

Project Fear predictions that thousands would lose jobs were WRONGThere are a roster of high-tech proposals to ensure customs checks can be carried out electronically with a minimum of friction.The document says: Since UK and EU standards are identical and will remain identical at the point of departure, determining equivalence after Brexit should be straightforward.The EU will be able to maintain the integrity of its internal market without erecting a hard border along its border with Northern Ireland, said the ERG paper, launched in Westminster.At the same time, the United Kingdom will be able to develop a fully independent trade policy rather than remaining a rule-taker.Brexit news: Jacob Rees-Mogg will tomorrow unveil the solution to the Irish border puzzle (Image: )The one element of \u0027alignment\u0027 necessary is the maintenance of the current Common Biosecurity Zone covering the island of Ireland, and this is not contentious.The proposals are part of a series of documents being presented by the European Research Group as an alternative to the Prime Minister\u0027s so-called Chequers proposals.Speaking at today\u0027s launch in Whitehall, Mr Rees-Mogg said: \u0026ldquoWe have been trying to answer the Irish border question from the EU\u0026rsquos point of view.\u0026ldquoI went to the meeting with the Brexit select committee to meet Monsoir Barnier last week and it was quite clear that his concern was maintaining the integrity of the single market.Brexit Irish border: Jacob Rees-Mogg said he has come up with the \u0027solution\u0027 to the Brexit deadlock (Image: EPA)\u0026ldquoAnd if we can can provide a border which is as good as the existing EU borders, then that answers that question to a reasonable test.\u0026ldquoThat is what I think is new about this paper.When asked about the potential of a leadership challenge to Theresa May over her Chequers Brexit proposal, the MP for North East Somerset said: \u0026ldquoI have long said and repeated again and again that I think the policy needs to be changed but I am supporting the person.\u0026ldquoTheresa May has enormous virtues, she\u0026rsquos a fantastically dutiful Prime Minister and she has my support \u0026ndash I just want her to change one item of policy.Former Brexit Secretary, David Davis, said: I have made very plain from when I resigned and thereafter that I think we have got a very good Prime Minister and, like Jacob, I disagree with her on one issue - this issue.She should stay in place because we need stability and we need decent government as the backdrop to what we are doing in the coming six months.The dispute over the Irish border has turned into one of the biggest obstacles to a free trade between the UK and the EU.EU Exit Secretary Dominic Raab and Brussels chief negotiator Michel Barnier were reported to have had a blazing row about the issue last week.Mr Rees-Mogg said he still supported the Prime Minister (Image: SKY)Mr Barnier has claimed that keeping Northern Ireland in the EU\u0027s customs union and single market is the only way of avoiding a hard border between the two territories.But the Prime Minister has repeatedly insisted the province cannot be treated differently to the rest of the UK.Eurosceptics claim the issue is being exploited by the EU and Remainers to try to thwart a clean break with Brussels.The Democratic Unionist Party said that the ERG proposals were positive and timely.Davis Davis said Theresa May is a very good Prime Minister (Image: SKY)Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: The paper makes clear that, in the event of a free trade deal being negotiated with the EU, there are sensible practical measures which can ensure there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.It therefore accurately reflects the fact that the border issue is no impediment to the negotiation by the UK of a comprehensive trade deal with the EU. This a position we have consistently articulated.For too long some have used the border issue, and the political process in Northern Ireland more generally, to try to mould Brexit to their way of thinking or to thwart it altogether.

And then, of course, we will see what concessions Mrs May has said.Jersey is the largest of the Channel Islands, and is a Crown dependency of the UK with a special relationship with the EU.According to Jersey\u0027s Ministry of External Relations: \u0026ldquoIn simple terms, the Island is treated as part of the EU for the purposes of free trade in goods, but otherwise is not a part of the EU.Both Jersey and Guernsey voluntarily use EU legislation or the international standards on which they are based.Jersey is in a customs union with Brussels and does have access to the EU\u0026rsquos single market for goods but not for services such as the finance, which it negotiates with the bloc on a case-by-case basis.Mrs May\u0026rsquos Brexit plan, calling for close regulatory alignment with the EU\u0026rsquos single market for British exports, has faced scrutiny from both Brexiteers and Remainers.The proposal includes plans to create a common rule book \u0026ndash involving a free trade area with the EU on industrial and agricultural goods.The Brexit plan has been heavily criticised by former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson since the Tory MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip resigned over the agreement in July.On Sunday, Boris Johnson wrote that Mrs May was wrapping a \u0026ldquosuicide vest around a \u0026ldquogreat British Brexit.But Mrs May has so far vowed to stick by her controversial Brexit blueprint.The EU\u0026rsquos chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has previously rejected Mrs May\u0026rsquos plans and ruled out any special economic relationship with the UK \u0026ndash claiming it would unravel the entire \u0026ldquoEuropean project.But in a shock u-turn, Mr Barnier told a forum in Slovenia on Monday it is realistic to expect a orce deal with Britain in six to eight weeks \u0026ndash suggesting the orce could be settled by the week beginning October 15 \u0026ndash just in time for the EU Summit on October 18.The EU chief negotiator said: I think that if we are realistic we are able to reach an agreement on the first stage of the negotiation, which is the Brexit treaty, within 6 or 8 weeks.Taking into account the time necessary for the ratification process, the House of Commons on one side, the European Parliament and the Council on the other side\u0026hellip We must reach an agreement before the beginning of November.

UK weather forecast: Britain braces for FIERCE STORM and TORNADOES                UK weather forecast SHOCK: Early winter FREEZE to blast Britain Met Office meteorologist Emma Smith said: \u0026ldquoThere is a chance Helene will be caught up in the jet stream and that would bring some wet and windy weather to the UK after the weekend.\u0026ldquoHowever this will depend on the conditions around the UK at the time of arrival, it could end up strengthening high pressure emphasising drier conditions.The remnants of the storm could supercharge a burst of warm air already set to sweep into southeastern Britain this weekend.Temperatures are tipped to reach 25C (77F) across East Anglia, Kent, Essex and and London on Sunday with highs in the mid-20Cs forecast into next week.The remains of Helene are expected to nudge thermometers even higher brining a freakishly warm spell of weather to southern Britain.Miss Smith added: \u0026ldquoThere is a chance the southeast could turn very warm next week and this could be another effect of the remnants of Helene.\u0026ldquoAlready we expect temperatures in the region to be higher than average for the time of year due to the direction of airflow bringing warmer air in from the Atlantic.\u0026ldquoAir associated with Helene could end up being caught up with this bringing even warmer conditions.Helene, a category-2 hurricane with wind speeds topping 110mph, is currently hurtling north-westwards across the Atlantic.UK weather forecast: Hurricane Helene could strike Britain (Image: NETWEATHER)It is forecast to switch direction and take a north-eastward path towards the UK on Friday before reaching British shores early next week.Wind speeds should drop to around 70mph as Helene is downgraded to a tropical storm on its track towards western Europe.However she is expected to strengthen over the next few days as she feeds on warm, moist air over the Atlantic.A spokesman for the US National Hurricane Centre said: \u0026ldquoThere still appears to be a small window of opportunity for Helene to strengthen, during the next 12 hours or so.\u0026ldquoGlobal models show Helene either maintaining tropical storm strength or even intensifying by the end of the period, possibly due to some mid-latitude dynamic forcing influences.\u0026ldquoA turn more toward the northwest is forecast early on Wednesday Helene should slowly turn northward and then north-northeastward during the next 72 to 96 hours, followed by a turn toward the northeast.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos also worth noting that the

winds with torrential rainfall raising fears floods could leave thousands homeless.Tropical Storm Isaac poses less of a threat although its increasing wind speeds have put parts of the Caribbean on alert for impact later this week.The three-storm attack follows warnings this autumn could bring increased tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic although this number forming at the same time is unusual.Some spaghetti models show the trio converging in the middle of the ocean over the next few days spawning a giant mega-hurricane.However the most likely outcome is that Florence hits the eastern United States as Issac smashes Central America while Helene veers towards Europe and the UK.UK weather forecast: A spaghetti model showing Hurricane Helene reaching Britain (Image: CYCLOCANE)The journey of the storm will be guided by a powerful jet stream acting like a conveyor belt between the Atlantic and the United Kingdom.Unusually high wind speeds and the meandering nature of the rapidly-flowing ribbon of air high in the atmosphere are to blame, experts say.Piers Corbyn, forecaster for WeatherAction, said a blast of tropical air could push temperatures to 28C (82.4F) in the south next week.He said: \u0026ldquoThere is going to be a general increase in temperatures across parts of the country next week and this is due to the jet stream going through a phase of wild deviations due to lower solar activity.\u0026ldquoThe jet stream is currently stronger and faster than usual and is much wavier meaning it dips and sweeps across its path.\u0026ldquoWe expect it to bring a plume of air in from the south, this will have originated from Africa and the Continent, but with the addition of warm air brought in by Helene temperatures could rise very high in parts.\u0026ldquoWe would not be surprised to see 27C (80.6F) or 28C (82.4F) next week.The weather across the world is getting wilder and weirder, causing chaos, death and destruction around the

Many of them need to listen to Sir Christopher Meyer, a former Remainer who is now looking forward to a brighter future free of the EU’s iron grip.It is crucial that everybody involved in these next vital months of negotiations is genuinely ambitious about what Britain can be as a truly independent country.We have the fifth-largest economy in the world and we’re a “soft-power” titan.There might be people in Brussels who think we are doomed to failure once we leave — but there shouldn’t be any ­sitting on our side of the table.If the Government prepares us properly for a clean break over the coming months, we’ve no reason to be scared for the future. It will strengthen our hand in negotiations, too.So get on with THAT, Prime Minister.THE Russian bear is roaring, and we don’t seem ready to defend ourselves.Today a respected intelligence expert suggests our border control could have been hacked by Russian spies in the run-up to the Salisbury attack.The Prime Minister has been admirably tough with the Kremlin, even if Jeremy Corbyn and other useful idiots have attempted to undermine her and our ­national security at every turn.But there is no room for complacency.

YEEEEES!”And for what?Stacey Dooley, that’s what. Star of BBC3’s box office smash Stacey Dooley Investigates: Second Chance Sex Offenders and now Stacey Dooley investigates how many people had to Google her name on Sunday morning.She is by no means, though, the most anonymous of the new batch on the 16th series of Strictly, which was quick to remind us of its past triumphs, and equally swift to jog our memories about all the things that remain wrong with this show.Bruno Tonioli is still there, for starters. So’s Tess with those links that all seem to have passed through about ten light-entertainment BBC sub committees, where they’re vetted for any hint of spontaneity.“Swapping the radio studio for the dance studio.”“Swapping the newsroom for the ballroom.”“Ditching the cricket balls for the glitter balls.”Devotees of the show don’t care about these details, of course, and nor do floating viewers if they throw us a single high-profile comedy bone, in the Ed Balls mould, who can transform Strictly Come Dancing into the funniest show on television.Much like last year’s box-ticking frenzy, though, something has gone badly wrong with the booking process again and the class of 2018 has no maverick entertainer, just a lot of people you might vaguely recognise off the telly.Among the slightly more famous contestants there’s dance-trained Pussycat Doll Ashley Roberts, Steps’ Faye Tozer, Lee Ryan out of Blue, Kate “The Silverback” Silverton, from BBC News, cricketer Graeme Swann and Susannah Constantine, who seemed to have got lost on the way to the Loose Women studio and mentioned “the menopause” before she’d even done her Mrs Overall impression in that group dance.Once through that lot, though, you’re into Stacey Dooley territory with Danny John-Jules, a Paralympian, some bloke called Charles off Casualty, who warmed the nation’s heart by referring to himself in the third person, and comedian Seann Walsh, who confirmed: “I’m not here to make anyone laugh.”A statement that should be all over Seann’s Edinburgh Fringe poster every year.The two bookings that irked me most, though, were local radio DJ Vick Hope, whose only recognisable feature is her perfume  and internet vlogger Joe Sugg, whose presence really did flag up TV’s general failure if 13million people are logging on to watch this bloke put cling film over his mate’s toilet bowl.It also told me, without much competition from The X Factor, Strictly’s got complacent and rather full of itself.The solution would seem obvious, though. Rip up the flat fee booking system, drop the salaries of the makeweights and spend the excess on a marquee booking like Richard Madeley, Prezza, Eamonn Holmes, Cherie Blair or Farage, who’d empty Britain’s streets with his jive.This is not just my opinion, obviously. Almost everyone who’s looked at this year’s Strictly line-up has concluded it’s not good enough.You can be pretty damn sure then the BBC will take the criticism on board, channel the opinions through a thousand sub-committees and conclude that, yes, unequivocally what this show needs is same sex couples.We live in nutty times.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “JFK: Remembering Jack is a book about which man?”Emma: “Pass.”Bradley Walsh: “2017, The Queen’s Sapphire Jubilee, marked how many years on the throne?”Emma: “100.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which UK Prime Minister starred in the 2003 episode of The Simpsons?”Mikayla: “Winston Churchill.”Bradley Walsh: “In the 1930s, Caroline Mikkelsen became the first woman to set foot in what continent?”Barrie: “Australia.”A CRACKING new series of Celebrity Island with Bear Grylls was immediately transformed into Fantasy Island on Sunday night, thanks to the arrival of Roxanne Pallett, who made an early promise/threat.“If someone gets stung by a jellyfish,” she claimed, earnestly, “I would wee on them.”And if they didn’t get stung? Roxanne would probably p*** on them from a great height anyway.You feared, then, for the latest selection of male celebs, James Cracknell, Anthony Ogogo, Martin Kemp, Towie’s Pete Wicks and star of The Specialist Eric Roberts, an obvious Hollywood casualty who still boasted: “I’ve been nominated for an Academy Award and three Golden Globes, and I’ve had so much fun I can’t see straight.”Yeah, can’t see straight, can’t stay awake and can’t remember anyone’s name either, so he started calling Martin Kemp “Colin”. Eric’s fantastic entertainment, though, and unlike the others has the gifts of honesty and intuition, so he was having none of Roxanne’s Penelope Pitstop routine.First she succumbed to “trench foot”. Then she was rescued from the water after her leg became dangerously entangled with the voices in her head, and finally Roxanne had to be evacuated from the island when the camp fire ignited long-buried memories of a teenage house fire.A tale of the unexpected that earned her a fond farewell from the other islanders and a muttered aside from Eric.“That story. When’s the movie coming out?”About the same time as The Specialist II.Alan Shearer: “After two defeats, Fulham have got a win and a victory.”Matt Murray: “If England had gone on and got that second goal, they’d have gone on and got it.”Neil Warnock: “The bookies are never wrong, but they weren’t right last year.”Lee Dixon: “You can sing about England’s midfield about as long as the cow’s come home.”THERE will be no more lift-exiting or corridor- charging for Keeley Hawes after BBC1’s Bodyguard killed off her Home Secretary Julia Montague on Sunday night.A revelation that may have one or two of you screaming: “Thanks for the spoiler alert,” but tough luck. The rest of us are fed up putting everything on hold for stragglers who think the world revolves around their schedule.And anyway, codes of silence should exist only for those truly great dramas, like The Sopranos or ER, which understand you have to earn the right to kill off one of your main characters and jumping that gun smacks of arrogance.As popular as it’s been, Bodyguard clearly isn’t in this bracket.It’s far too full of plot holes and box-ticking to be anywhere near Sopranos class, in fact, and Richard Madden’s Sergeant Zoolander character doesn’t begin to look capable of carrying the show on his own.Don’t, however, rule out the possibility of a last-minute redemption.If Bodyguard really is as edgy, risk-taking, different-from-the-herd and brilliant as writer Jed Mercurio seems to think, then it’ll conclude the person responsible for the explosions, death and every other misery visited on humanity wasn’t a white, middle-class man.I’m not exactly holding my breath here, though.On Friday’s This Morning, Eamonn Holmes announces: “Next, masturbation, we’re getting stuck into that.Martin Lewis is here at 10:45, Matthew Wright’s popping in at ten past 11 . . .”And if Jamie Oliver appears, we’ve got a whole studio full of them.THIS week’s winner is Kim Woodburn and Mata, from The Emperor’s New Groove.Emailed in by James McGuire.

The first night will culminate in a “festival and funfair”-themed party where 500 guests including Naomi Campbell, George Clooney and Kate Moss will ride dodgems and play on coconut shies as Robbie Williams and Ellie Goulding perform.So far, so OTT.And good for her! If Princess Eugenie wants a Big Fat Royal Wedding, she should have one. Why not get Gypsy Wedding stitcher Thelma Madine to team up with Chanel and make a £50,000, 20st, glow-in-the-dark dress?Why doesn’t Eugenie ride to the church in a giant horse-drawn orb like Katie Price or say her vows on golden Beckham-style thrones?It is beautiful Eugenie has found love — she should celebrate however she wants. But where Eugenie’s special day crosses into outrageous is in expecting the public to pay her gigantic security bill.Eugenie’s insistence on being paraded through the streets of Windsor like Marie Antoinette means security is now going to cost us, the taxpayers, an astronomical TWO MILLION POUNDS.Officers on overtime rates will be drafted in, with dozens required to search the procession route in advance.Hard-working Brits who have struggled with eight years of austerity and been exhausted by endless police cuts will bear the brunt of that extra policing so we might catch a glimpse of Eugenie sashaying past in her open-top carriage.Is this what Eugenie meant when she said in a recent interview that she wanted to “share our world” with us?There’s nothing more tasteless than asking other people to pay for your extravagant wedding.Recently a story went viral about a bridezilla called Susan who’d demanded her friends cough up towards her £47,000 bash.Yet Eugenie’s demands make small change of that. As her guests romp on dodgems and get hammered on cocktails, we’ll be hoping we don’t get stabbed or sprayed with acid on the way to the shops because there probably won’t be many cops to help us.Extreme? Maybe not when we hear — as we did last month — that a third of bobbies on the beat have been axed in the past three years, while crime has shot up.Some fed-up villagers have even started paying for their own security firms.You hear that, Eugenie? Paying for their own security!Indeed, we might ask why Eugenie’s dad, Prince Andrew, worth some £65million, isn’t dipping into his reservoir of cash to pay the security bill?It is he who is apparently so keen for Eugenie to make a carriage-drawn arrival at church. Just as Andrew was adamant his daughters should retain Princess status in the face of Prince Charles’ worthy attempts to slim down the monarchy.Perhaps Eugenie’s groom Jack Brooksbank — the great-grandson of Sir John Spencer Coke, the son of the 2nd Earl of Leicester — might stump up some cash?Or Eugenie herself could contribute? Even if it might mean troubling her £3.6million trust funds or taking one fewer holiday this year?In an interview with Vogue Eugenie spoke with her sister Beatrice about wanting to be seen as “real”.Yet in some ways, “real” is exactly what Eugenie is. A marginal royal, she has no official royal function.She is not responsible for carrying out any royal engagements or public duties. For us, then, she does nothing.For Prince Harry, it made sense to indulge in a whistles-and-bells Royal Wedding .People like Harry, you see. Harry performs royal duties . He has served in the Forces and established the Invictus Games. An psos Mori poll this year had him and his gran — aka the Queen — as the world’s most favourite royals. For us Brits he was the favourite.But we can’t and shouldn’t roll out the platinum carpet for every minor royal who ties the knot. To do so makes a mockery of the royals’ claims they want to modernise.It reinforces the dated and offensive notion that the aristocracy are born to deserve better than us.In that Vogue interview Eugenie spoke about how she wanted her wedding to be plastic-free. How very woke.I just wish this supposedly modern royal was as conscious of social inequality as she is of the environmentOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nor commit a penny of our divorce bill without tying it to a decent deal.It would be fatal for her. Chequers looks almost dead as it is. Even if Barnier breathes life into it, many Tories are still vowing to vote it down.IT’S easy to dismiss Boris Johnson’s call for tax cuts as a ruse to distract from his personal difficulties. But he is right.The PM and her wet-blanket Chancellor have swallowed the group think about imposing new taxes to fund the NHS.Not only is it wrong, it plays into ­Corbyn’s hands. What’s the difference, voters will wonder, between Labour and the Tories if both will raise my tax?The overall burden is at a 30-year high. We should cut income tax, capital gains tax and stamp duty. It is a sure way to boost growth. Bizarrely, it can sometimes increase the sums raised.Donald Trump’s cuts to tax and regulation put rocket-boosters under US growth. We should do the same — and put more money in pockets . . .Not drain more life out of the economy.PARLIAMENT’S seats must be reformed to make elections fairer. The logic is ­unassailable. MPs must not reject it out of self-interest.It’s not a plot by the independent Boundary Commission against Brexiters. Nor is it against Labour, who ­routinely end up with more MPs than they deserve because they need fewer votes to win safe seats than the Tories.Each vote must carry the same weight.So boundaries must change and constituencies must be evened up, regardless of the upheaval — or the senior politicians inconvenienced. It would have been done years ago had the Lib Dems not ratted on a deal in Coalition.Reducing the number of MPs makes sense too, not least to save taxpayers money.

He says the Government lost £46 billion in revenues because of the duty freeze. Bunkum!“What would the economy be delivering with pump prices at £1.60 a litre.”Speaking after the debate Mr Halfon told The Sun: “The Treasury themselves say that fuel duty freeze has grown the economy and offset any loss of taxes.“The Chancellor should listen to the Treasury and keep the freeze for millions of hard-pressed motorists.”The row came just a day after former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson demanded the Tories cut tax to help “strivers”.He urged the UK to mimic the US under Donald Trump – where tax cuts have been credited with kick-starting an incredible revival in the world’s biggest economy.

I couldn’t say goodbye to anyone.“They had me in a taxi and were following me, then I was dropped off in the town where the bus station is.”Harriet is now staying with her dad in Oxford while she recovers from her ordeal and says she still hasnt been contacted by Italian police.She said: “They’ve reimbursed me for my flights and the rest of my wage as if I’d finished my contract.“But I want them to recognise what went wrong and then tell me how they’re going to improve it if it happens again. Something needs to change – it’s not acceptable.“To be in a foreign country and have no support whatsoever is scary.“I’m resilient, but for someone who is already terrified of what happened, their lack of reaction would just shut them up. That can’t be allowed to happen.”Thomas Cook confirmed the alleged offender had been suspended.A spokesman told The Sun Online: “The safety and wellbeing of our customers and staff is our first priority and we have been supporting Harriet since this incident was reported, and arranged counselling for her since she returned home.”Polizia di Stato, the Italian state police, have been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000430200438.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"drinking three glasses of full fat milk a day can help you live longer study finds","story":"It can also protect against heart disease and stroke — flying in the face of current medical advice to choose skimmed instead.The researchers, from Canada’s McMaster University, looked at the diets of 130,000 adults in 21 countries over nine years.Those who consumed the most full-fat dairy  produce — an average of 3.2 servings a day — also had the lowest rates of mortality, cardiovascular disease and stroke.

but only if the EU gives way on its Irish border hardline.One Cabinet minister told The Sun: “Plan A is the EU27 show enough leg to keep Chequers alive, at least until after conference.“That’s far from clear yet, so we need a Plan B.That is, if you’re in a cul de sac the best way to get out of it is fast.”The senior minister added: “The Prime Minister will not be left stranded, so work is under way to ensure she can pivot away from Chequers quickly if she needs to after Salzburg”.The 27 EU leaders are expected to boost Mrs May with warm words in Salzburg about the Brexit divorce deal and future security partnership.But No10 aides fear they may well still give her the thumbs down on Chequers’ two key planks - the Future Customs Arrangement and single market access for good only.Cabinet minister allies are also unsure Mrs May can survive a third major change of plan on Brexit.One added: “Has the PM got the dexterity to pull off a pivot?Quite frankly, that’s not clear to me”.It has also emerged that the PM’s chief spin doctor told Brexiteers that the Chequers plan could yet change substantially during a dinner in No10 on Monday night.Wining and dining senior critics of the soft Brexit plan, Downing Street comms boss Robbie Gibb pleaded with nine Tory MPs to get behind Mrs May, hinting sweeping changes to the plans are coming.Over salmon, asparagus soup and white wine in the PM’s wood panelled dining room, MPs claim Mr Gibb told them not to “die in a ditch” as the final deal could look very different as it is still “subject to negotiations”.However allies of Mr Gibb present dispute the account.But the charm offensive backfired after Brexiteer ringleader Bernard Jenkin “lost his temper” and lashed out that the Chequers model would never work.Fellow Tory Daniel Kawczynski hit out at Mrs May’s stance that a soft Brexit was needed because of Northern Ireland, pointing to the Poland’s border with Belarus to show smuggling can be countered.And Mr Gibb’s warning there could be a second referendum if Chequers collapsed was “noisily dismissed by the whole room”, who pointed out that the PM would have to table such a vote herself and has already ruled it out.Last night eurocrats warned that expectations on the UK side of an imminent breakthrough in the talks had been overinflated.A senior EU official told The Sun: “There’s a lot of overspin about changing the mandate.The mood music here is we aren’t going to do that.“The Brits shouldn’t have illusions.The spin that Barnier will be sidelined and it’ll be much easier to make a different deal with the leaders, that’s not how the process works.“There’s a lot of overspin these days on the UK side and we have to be very cautious with all that because the disappointment will be rather big.”The official also said that British hopes a summit of EU leaders in Salzburg will change the course of the talks are misplaced.They said: “People shouldn’t expect that Salzburg will suddenly dramatically change our position or the course of the negotiations.”However, the PM was handed a rare boost by Hungarian leader Viktor Orban who said his country wants to see Britain handed a generous trade deal.He said: “We would like to have a fair Brexit because we love the British and we cooperated always well.You deserve a good deal, a fair deal.”The PM told a meeting of her Cabinet that Salzburg will be “a staging post” towards a Brexit deal.He added: “The PM said she expected EU leaders to take stock of the progress made in the negotiations on both the withdrawal and future relationship.“It will also be the first time leaders will discuss together the UK’s white paper, which put forward a series of credible and serious proposals.”Meanwhile Brexiteers stepped up their attack on the PMs plans - telling her chief of staff at a dinner in No10 that she must chuck her Chequers blueprint or face a leadership contest.One MP warned chief of staff Gavin Barwell that a leadership contest was almost certainly to be triggered as early as next month if she stuck to her current plan.Mr Barwell promised them hed give the PM a full appraisal of their views.At a separate meeting of the influential backbench European Research Group hardened their opposition to the PM.A Tory MP in the meeting said everyone in the room agreed Mrs Mays time was up.The MP told itv news: Everyone I know says she has to go, shes a disaster, this cant go on.The group of about 50 backbench Tory MPs even war-gamed a leadership contest, the MP said.The number at the ERG meeting is significant given only 48 Tory MPs are needed to trigger a no confidence vote in the leader.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And, though we DO meet Nato’s spending target, ours has declined steadily.Defence chief Sir Nick Carter has rightly warned “our ability to pre-empt or respond to threats will be eroded if we don’t keep up with our adversaries”.France has finally committed to raise its defence spending.We must too . . .And convince Donald Trump that a strong, united Nato is vital for global security.THE Help To Buy scheme is a vastly expensive and flawed sticking-plaster to the housing crisis. Its future must be reviewed.Some £8billion of public money has been splurged on George Osborne’s idea to give first-time buyers interest-free loans to buy a brand-new property.And while it HAS helped many, they have often paid over the odds and will be stuck with a home which they can’t sell or is in negative equity if prices dip.Meanwhile, Help To Buy has made fortunes for building giants and their lavishly paid bosses. They have built more houses, but not nearly enough for the extra demand the scheme created.The REAL solution is for the Government to free up land and relax planning rules to get hundreds of thousands more homes built for our booming population.That, and that alone, will help make them genuinely more affordable and get a generation on to the property ladder.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

boosting our mental health.The claims were made by Robin Murphy from the University of Oxford and Matthew Sachs from Hard University.And those who experience the sensation also tend to be in better physical health, are more creative and friendlier than those who don’t, according to the study.Participants in the study watched a 45 minute performance at a summer music festival - 55 per cent said they experienced goose bumps during it and the rest did not.The researchers then asked them about their outlook on life, how empathetic they are, perceptions of their own mental and physical health and more - before comparing the findings.Carried out to celebrate the benefits available to cardholders through Barclaycard Entertainment, the study follows previous studies which identified live music as one the biggest causes of goose bumps.Robin Murphy, associate professor of experimental psychology at Oxford University, said: “The phenomenon of goose bumps has intrigued us for many years and having the opportunity to test participants in a live setting has certainly provided some food for thought.“The results of the Barclaycard study are the first to show a correlation between different personality traits and people who experience goose bumps.“The evidence suggests that being truly connected with live entertainment and getting goose bumps, has an impact on our overall sense of well-being and mood.”The study found 66 per cent of those who experienced the shivery sensation perceived themselves to be in good emotional and physical health - 46 per cent who didn’t have them said the same.Similarly, more of those who got the tingles  claimed to feel happier after watching the performance than those who did not get them .While 80 per cent who had goose bumps described themselves as ‘empathetic’ and ‘agreeable’ compared to 63 per cent of the sample who didn’t.It also emerged more of those who got goose bumps had a stronger interest in creative activities such as baking, painting and writing.However, more of those who did NOT get goose bumps claimed to be confident than those who DID experience them - 82 per cent compared to 60 per cent.During the experiment, more women  experienced goose bumps than men .And the researchers believe this suggests females tend to make stronger emotional connections to music than males do.A total of 126 goose bump moments were experienced during the study - an average of three moments per minute.And they were found to most commonly occur during the first minute of a song.Barclaycard also commissioned research of 2,000 UK adults where 77 per cent were found to have experienced goose bumps - leaving 23 per cent who NEVER have.However, those who do, experience them six times a month on average – that’s 371 occasions during their lifetime.Among the biggest causes of goose bumps were live entertainment, ‘amazing’ singing voices, guitar solos and crowds singing along together en masse.But the survey also found seven in 10 UK adults have no idea what purpose the tingly sensation serves.Daniel Mathieson, head of experiential marketing at Barclaycard, said: “Most of us can relate to experiencing goose bumps when watching live entertainment.And now we have a clear understanding of why this happens and what it means for us as individuals.“The results reflect the overwhelmingly positive impact music and live entertainment can have on our lives ranging from health and happiness to overall wellbeing.“It’s truly exciting to be part of the first ever scientific study of its kind.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433265964.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"home and garden shop the range apologises over rocking zombie child halloween display after parents complain its terrifying kids","story":"The ghoulish figure, which has no eyes, left young kids jumping out of their skin at The Range in Plymstock, near Plymouth, Devon.Mum Lisabeth Jones, 36, was shopping with for storage boxes with her children, aged two and six, when she spotted the horror show.She told Plymouth Live: I was disturbed by these models, let alone them .I’m praying it doesn’t cause them nightmares.Lisabeth complained to the customer services over the dead child exhibit, which rocks as you walk past it.In a message on a Facebook, she added: My two-year-old jumped out of his skin when one of them moved.Parents have slammed the home and garden shop over the exhibit, that also features a giant skeleton and a red clown.This is too much to be displayed in such a prominent position.Please reconsider to ensure it is child-appropriate.Other parents have taken to social media to vent their outrage at the display.One dad wrote: I have felt unable to go to the range with my children for several years in October but starting this early is a real disappointment.Clearly we can’t go shopping in The Range until November.Another parent said: This is absolutely over the top.

with one Texas based firm admitting they didn’t pay drivers overtime for at least a year.Others claimed they felt powerless to address problems at work fearing they would be fired or have their wages docked.Justin Waring, a former driver told Business Insider: If I didnt come in on my day off, they threatened to fire me.”When contacted by The Sun Online, an Amazon spokesperson referred to the statements it had issued to Business Insider.These read: While it is impossible to characterise a network of thousands of delivery drivers based on anecdotes, we do recognise small businesses sometimes need more support when scaling fast.We have worked with our partners, listened to their needs, and have implemented new programs to ensure small delivery businesses serving Amazon customers have the tools they need to deliver a great customer and employee experience.Our recently launched Delivery Service Partner program offers a number of new features including customized branded vehicles for delivery, preventative vehicle maintenance services, low-cost vehicle and employee insurance plans, and a payroll system customized for their business.We are simultaneously recruiting new businesses into this program and transitioning our existing delivery partners into this new program.Hundreds of delivery associates are working full-time jobs that offer competitive pay and comprehensive benefits through their delivery service provider.Amazon requires all delivery service providers to abide by applicable laws and Amazons Supplier Code of Conduct, which focuses on fair wages, appropriate working hours and compensation,“We investigate any claim that a provider isnt complying.The majority of drivers complete their daily routes in under nine hours, which factor in breaks, traffic patterns, and more.And in cases where inclement weather or traffic may impact a drivers ability to complete a customer delivery on time, Amazon works closely with delivery service providers to make adjustments to their delivery route and, if necessary, DSPs call drivers to return to the station.Earlier this year it was revealed warehouse workers in the UK faced similar pressures and conditions.One ex-worker said staff fear getting into trouble for taking too long away from the job.The warehouse measures 700,000 sq ft and some of the 1,200 workers face a ten minute, quarter-of-a-mile walk to two toilets on the ground floor of the four-storey building.Undercover investigator James Bloodworth said: “For those of us who worked on the top floor, the closest toilets were down four flights of stairs.”Mr Bloodworth, who worked ten-hour shifts as a picker selecting goods for despatch, walked ten miles a day in the job to research for a book on low-wage Britain.It

hundred years, these gangs – which were collectively known as The Five Points Gang – practically ran the city.Under their rule, Five Points gained international notoriety for having the highest murder rate of any slum in the world and stories of violent confrontation between warring gangs became the stuff of legend.The images - by Jacob Riis, the renowned journalist and social documentary photographer - show violent thugs like the Short Tail Gangs who were known to the police as hard drinkers and thieves.Also pictured are an Irish-American group known as The Gopher Gang at the peak of their power and groups of young boys robbing drunk men in New York in the early 1900s.Five Points was a nineteenth century neighbourhood in the area now known as Lower Manhattan in New York City.The run-down Manhattan district became the centre of settlement for the poorest and least fortunate immigrants.Irish, Italian and Eastern European immigrants and freed Black slaves settled in Five Points.Gambling dens and brothels were numerous in the area, and it was considered a dangerous destination, where many people had been mugged particularly at night and where race riots would regularly break out.In 1842, author Charles Dickens visited the area and was appalled by the terrible living conditions.At the height of the Five Points, only certain areas of London’s East End vied with it in the western world for population density, disease, child mortality, prostitution and crime.Organised criminal gangs, like The Bowery Boys, The Dead Rabbits, The Short Tails, The Gopher Gang, The Whyos Gang and the Montgomery Guards cropped up across Manhattan.Each group had had their own way of letting people know who they stood with.The Bowery Boys, a gang mainly made up of firefighters, would go out in red shirts and stovepipe hats the Short Tails went out with their shirt untucked and the Irish Dead Rabbits would head out with a rabbit nailed to a stick.Meanwhile The Whyos – an Irish-American criminal group who ranged from pickpockets to murderers – had a distinctive gang’s cry which sounded like a bird or owl calling ‘Why-oh!’ to let people know they were on the streets.All of the gangs of Five Points competed for control of the revenue made from illicit activities and fights would break out over most anything.According to legend, the most dangerous building – a housing tenement called the “Old Brewery” – saw a murder every single night.The violent disputes between the gangs usually focused on race and nationality.Riots and fights broke out between the staunchly anti-Catholic Bowery Boys and the Irish Dead Rabbits.In one brutal two-day battle, an estimated 1,000 people took to the streets of New York to fight, beating each other senseless and looting one another’s homes.By the time the blood had dried, eight men were dead and up to a hundred more lay injured – an event that inspired Martin Scorseses 2002 film Gangs of New York.For a century, these notorious gangs ruled their neighbourhood but by the early 1900s, Five Points was torn down piece by piece.Politicians railed for it to be ripped apart with one telling his constituent: “This hot-bed of infamy, this modern Sodom, is situated in the very heart of your City.”The crime-riddled Old Brewery was pulled down, missionary houses were brought in, and bit by bit, the face of the city changed.The Five Points gangs were broken up and slowly faded into history."},{"url":null,"title":"shantell rebecca sutherland nurse drink drive baby shower","story":"Shantell Rebecca Sutherland, 27,

The ERG was formed in the early 1990s amid eurosceptic anger at the Maastricht Treaty, which paved the way for the formation of the European Union out of the European Community.Current estimates of the size of the ERG membership y from between 50 to 80.Mr Baker recently claimed 80 Tory MPs would be willing to vote against Mrs May\u0027s Chequers plan in the House of Commons.The ERG is partly publicly-funded as one of parliament\u0027s \"pooled services\".MPs who are members of the ERG are allowed to claim from their staffing or office costs their payments to the group, which charges an annual membership fee of \u0026#16320,000.All the other main parties also have their own \"pooled services\" groups.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey=\"\" data-targeting-platform=\"\" data-tag=\"\" data-component-name=\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" id=\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance=\"2\"He recently called on Mrs May to introduce Donald Trump-style tax cuts in the UK, which fuelled speculation he is laying the ground for a leadership bid.\u0027IT\u0027S THE WORST OF ALL WORLDS\u0027Tory Remainers are also unhappy with the Chequers plan, with MPs such as Justine Greening and Johnny Mercer describing the proposals as \"the worst of all worlds\".They are less robust in their criticism and have not voiced any direct attacks on the prime ministerBut some, such as Ms Greening, have their own uncomfortable history with Mrs May having previously served in her cabinet. The ex-education secretary resigned from government at the beginning of the year after refusing the job of work and pensions secretary in a reshuffle.Ms Greening is calling for a three-way referendum on Brexit a public choice between the Chequers plan, leaving the EU with no deal, or staying in the bloc.Meanwhile, fellow former minister Nick Boles is suggesting the prime minister tries to unite Tories by signing up to a Norway-style relationship with the EU for a short period before chasing a cleaner break afterwards.\u0027ARE WE THE ONES TO REPLACE MAY?\u0027Mrs May\u0027s current ministers are bound to the Chequers deal under government collective responsibility and, therefore, are professing public loyalty to the prime minister.However, a number will no doubt be harbouring their own leadership ambitions, with Sky News being told ministers are privately confiding to backbenchers that Mrs May \"has to go\".

Justin Welby blasted the Government\u0027s flagship welfare reform and warned it had triggered intense suffering and left many poor Brits worse off than they were. He also said the living wage should be higher and criticised firms like Amazon for paying almost nothing in taxes. In a question and answer session with delegates following his speech at the TUC Congress in Manchester, Rev Welby was asked for his view on Universal Credit. He said: Universal credit, we know, was supposed to reform the benefit system, make it simpler and more efficient. It has not done that. We know that.  We know that it has left too many people worse off than they were, putting people at the heightened risk of hunger. Lashing out at the controversial new system, he told delegates: Can you believe we say this in England, in the 21st century? Heightened risk of hunger, debt, rent arrears and food banks. We now know about 45% of people who attend food banks have at least one person in work. An awful lot of them have two people in work. And when Universal Credit comes into a local area the need for food banks goes up very significantly. He added that delays in people receiving benefits due to the reform are causing intense suffering and said the new system is not working.  What is clear is if they cannot get it right, they need to stop rolling it out. His answer won applause from hundreds of delegates in Manchester. The archbishop also won applause from delegates for a section of his speech devoted to tax. He said: Not paying taxes speaks of the absence of commitment to our shared humanity, to solidarity and justice. If you earn money from a community, you should pay your share of tax to that community. I was in business, and I know that, within limits, it\u0027s right and proper for people to arrange their tax affairs, and for companies to do so. But when vast companies like Amazon, and other online traders, the new industries, can get away with paying almost nothing in tax, there is something wrong with the tax system.

Police stood guard as the Old Etonian, his wife, their nanny and four of their six children were harangued by a small group outside their \u0026pound5.6m home in Westminster. A video posted last night by the Class War group shows the lead protester targeted Mr Rees-Mogg\u0027s children directly. Asking how much Mr Rees-Mogg pays his nanny, the man told the children: Daddy doesn\u0027t pay her very much! Daddy says the minimum wage doesn\u0027t count for anything!

Flanked by the Tory Brexiteer, she insisted she was very happy, Mr Rees-Mogg had been wonderful and he\u0027s got an apartment down here for me. As the lead activist accused the nanny of having Stockholm syndrome, the MP held one of his children while three more looked on in matching pastel pink outfits.

It comes amid claims the European Research Group , the influential body of pro-Brexit Tory MPs which Mr Rees-Mogg chairs, were last night openly discussing ways to remove Mrs May from power if she doesn’t row back on her Chequers plan. Speaking at the launch of the ERG’s plan for resolving the Northern Ireland Border issue, Mr Rees-Mogg offered the Prime Minister his support. He said Mrs May was “fantastically dutiful” and “the policy needs to change, not the person.” Former Brexit Secretary David Davis, speaking at the same event, added: “I think we’ve got a very good Prime Minister, but we disagree on one issue.”  He added: I have made very plain from when I resigned and thereafter that I think we have got a very good Prime Minister and, like Jacob, I disagree with her on one issue - this issue. She should stay in place because we need stability and we need decent government as the backdrop to what we are doing in the coming six months. Mr Rees-Mogg downplayed claims that as many as 50 of his group’s MPs were discussing Mrs May’s downfall. He said: “We are focusing on how the policy should change. The ERG is not in any way an organisation that’s involved in leadership issues.”  Mr Davis insisted there was already a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, adding: “It’s not a non-border, it’s an invisible border.” Both the EU and Britain want to avoid a so-called hard border between UK\u0027s Northern Ireland and the EU\u0027s Irish Republic because such a border could undermine a 1998 peace agreement that ended decades of sectarian conflict in the north. But it is still unclear how goods crossing between the EU and the UK in Ireland would be monitored if there is no border and if Northern Ireland, as a part of the UK, leaves both the customs union and the single market.

We\u0027re about to be shackled to the EU without any voting rights! We\u0027ll be a vassal state, just as some people warned a month before the referendum. It\u0027s all Theresa May\u0027s fault, off with with her head!  And so they gather in conspiratorial groups to secretly plot her downfall, while boasting to journalists about support they don\u0027t have and things they can\u0027t promise. If anyone has a sense of 2016 d\u0026eacutej\u0026agrave vu that\u0027s probably because the Conservative Party are re-fighting the EU referendum with themselves, and without learning a single lesson of how they cocked it up last time. Brexit is the first time in British democratic history that the manifesto turned up two years after the vote. We\u0027re all told that despite the obvious flaws in this the decision was binding, irreversible, and must be respected at all costs.  Which is a bit like having an arranged marriage with a man of Turkish extraction who you\u0027re told has both wealth and wit, and lifting the veil to see the groom is a gurning Boris Johnson.   As with the EU, they have developed an irrational loathing for a thing they chose, supported, and tasked with doing all the difficult stuff.  They have decided it is time to defenestrate Theresa May, just as the EU negotiators say a deal can be done inside 6 weeks and she appears to have squared the circle of doing an incredibly disruptive thing pretty smoothly.  And they are using the same tactics as they did with the EU, accusing her of high-handedness, dullness, smears, excessive paperwork, being anti-democratic and surely, by the end of the week, to have amassed a shoe mountain. To top it all they have absolutely no realistic plan what to do if they get their way. Not a single scooby doo about who, exactly, will be able to run things.   Boris Johnson is a rampaging wheelie bin of chaos, spewing old pants and stinky chicken juices in his path. His foreign relations have already caused diplomatic alarm, abandoned a British citizen to an Iranian jail and managed to make the White House look calm and thoughtful by comparison.  You wouldn\u0027t leave him and Donald Trump alone in a ball-pit, never mind give them nuclear weapons. Giving Boris Johnson the keys to Number 10 would be like holding a Black Friday sale in a whorehouse, a well-lubricated orgy of shuddering bellies, blapping and brou-ha-ha. The Downing Street steps would need hosing down every morning. He\u0027s interesting, but so are toddlers. They still struggle with motor skills and continence.   Which brings us to Lord Voldemort Rees-Mogg, who wants child abuse victims to bear the children of their rapists, believes 50 years is a reasonable length of time to wait for national prosperity, and no doubt cleans his teeth with the rib bones of peasants who have displeased.  Under his tenure Downing Street might not be plagued by pleasures of the flesh, but it would have to put up with policies focused on investment funds, paperwork annotated in Latin and nanny deciding when it was the Prime Minister\u0027s bedtime. With Mogg in charge of Brexit, there\u0027d be a border wall in Northern Ireland patrolled by gamekeepers, fishing vessels in the Channel crewed by Dementors and a police force consisting of beadles, childcatchers and Dixon of Dock Green. That might all float the boats of the Tory faithful, but Mogg could get Labour into power quicker than reintroducing the poll tax of 1380.   After those two are knocked out of court, the Tories are left with Slytherin\u0027s Michael Gove Fleshsuit and Sajid Javid, a man tipped for the top job solely because his dad once drove a bus.  No indication of whether he drove the bus well, had a plan about where he was going, or if his passengers screamed at his cornering. Just, \u0027bus\u0027. My dad used to be a bouncer for Mungo Jerry, can I be Health Secretary? If that\u0027s the qualification needed to run the country, Gove must be kicking himself for being adopted by a fishmonger. A man capable of Shakespearian plotting and who appears to be a version of Iago turned inside out in the wash, the best that could be hoped of Gove is that he is a Snape-like double agent secretly working to save us all. But the Queen would abdicate before agreeing to watch him slurp tea every week. Tory MPs would freeze to death, Vladimir Putin would be allowed across the threshold and once Gove had access to the nation\u0027s blood banks they\u0027d be sucked dry.   If Brexit has been cocked up, it wasn\u0027t Theresa May who did it. She\u0027s arguably had a near-impossible task to implement a vote about a dream, extract a nation from 40 years of custom and legislation, and find a way to control our borders when our only land border with the EU has previously voted not to have any controls on it.  Brexit was rendered a disaster by the very same headbangers on the run from sanity who are currently chanting Theresa must go, and who campaigned for a thing without any idea about what to do once they actually got it. And we have all been able to see that, once they had the thing they wished for, they started to eat each other. They have spent two years gorging themselves on each other\u0027s soft entrails and are now raising their gore-smeared faces to notice, with alarm, that they are surrounded by DNA evidence and eyewitnesses.  With 6 months to go until a Brexit which, mercifully for most of us, may well not make our lives much different, the vultures have begun to circle above the heads of those who wasted millions and caused chaos for very little purpose. They\u0027re now engaged in a scramble for survival, slipping through each other\u0027s bodily fluids in a struggle to shift the blame onto someone, anyone, else. But if the definition of insanity is doing the same thing repeatedly in hope of a different outcome, then Tories Not Having Any Sensible Plan At All is like watching them hold a fireworks display in the Parliamentary basement - a party everyone else will avoid.  Now, wouldn\u0027t this be a great time for Labour to come up with a plan instead?

The Tory Environment Secretary had raised hopes of an outright ban in April by launching a consultation with all options on the table. But despite the \u0027call for evidence\u0027 closing in May there is still no final decision. And asked three times directly about a ban today, Mr Gove repeatedly avoided using the word ban - using the word restrict instead. It comes despite more than a million people signing petitions across Europe calling for an outright ban on the practice in the EU.  More than 380,000 sheep, 10,000 cattle and 8,000 pigs were exported alive from the UK to EU for slaughter in 2016. Government documents admit all forms of transport may have negative effects on the animal\u0027s welfare. Mr Gove was questioned about the policy on BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme. He eventually insisted a ban was still possible and all options are on the table. But asked if Britain would see an end to live exports, he replied: We\u0027re going to see restrictions on live animal exports, certainly, and we\u0027re consulting at the moment. Asked if he was minded to ban them, Mr Gove replied: I\u0027m minded to restrict them, yes. And I\u0027m looking at the evidence to see how we can take appropriate steps. We\u0027re gathering evidence at the moment and we want to make sure that we can do this in the right way.  Asked again if he was minded to ban the exports, Mr Gove replied: I\u0027m minded to take every step we can in order to ensure that we restrict animal exports and safeguard animal welfare. The interview came days after the Compassion in World Farming campaign claimed a ban was looking like a more remote possibility. The campaigners wrote: [The government] have now passed the consultation over to the Farm Animal Welfare Committee  for advice on how best to proceed. However, rather than asking the FAWC to review a possible ban, Defra have instead asked for recommendations on improving conditions during live transport.  Whilst this does not necessarily mean that live exports will continue, it is worrying that the focus is on improving conditions, rather than banning this cruel and completely unnecessary practice. Campaign spokesman James West said today: We are concerned that Mr Gove appears to be back tracking on his live export commitment. On numerous occasions, Michael Gove has spoken about how the government are considering stopping live exports for slaughter. This morning, when pressed, he repeatedly used the word ‘restrict’.

Rachael Casella realised her little girl\u0027s photographs had been stolen from her profile and, worse still, were being used to scam money out of clueless social media users. Mackenzie was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy in March 2017, when she was 10 weeks old, and her parents\u0027 happy, blissful world was cruelly ripped away from them. Rachael and her husband Jonathan were told the condition - a rare neuromuscular disorder - would cause Mackenzie to lose her ability to move, swallow and eventually to breathe. It was terminal, and their baby girl wouldn\u0027t live to see her first birthday.  In October, Mackenzie fell ill and died in their arms aged just seven months and 11 days. The mum, from Sydney, told  she has used Instagram as a \u0027form of therapy\u0027 - a place I could talk about our little girl to whoever wanted to listen, to celebrate her. The couple also wanted to raise awareness of SMA and change how genetic testing is done in Australia in order to save other children\u0027s lives. But this has been exploited by cruel trolls who have stolen the images for their own financial gain. Rachael posted on Instagram yesterday to share her disgust, saying: For the past three weeks I have been fighting off despicable humans who have stolen Mackenzie’s story and identity to scam people out of money.  They call her Sophie and ask people for money to help her. Many people have lost money believing they are doing something kind. She also scared screenshots containing all of the photos stolen from her account, and claims she has reported the fake profiles to Instagram more than 50 times. The profiles Rachael listed are no longer visible on the site, but she says even when the social platform has taken action and deleted the accounts, they have been reactivated or had a name change the next day. Since Australian media covered the fake Instagram accounts, Rachael says she made the mistake of reading the comments - and found people were blaming her. The comments primarily focus on calling us idiots for putting photos of Mackenzie on Instagram.  They blame us, the victims. They call us narcissistic for telling our story and for wanting sympathy. They tease our need for money to under go IVF. Rachael and Jonathan have been desperately trying to raise awareness of the disorder and to improve genetic testing in Australia. She said: For a year we campaigned, we met with prominent people, with politicians, with scientists who agreed with our aims and we raised awareness through my Instagram @mylifeof_love, my blog www.mylifeoflove and slowly we built an army, Mackenzie’s army.

They had lit the room using candles, including tea lights on the floor. But as Crystal Turner-Brightman, 17, struck a pose, the flame of one of these candles caught her dress – setting the youngster on fire. There are no words that can describe how painful it was, said Crystal, from Southampton.  I panicked as I really didn’t know what to do. I remember being extremely hot but adrenalin is a very powerful thing, I just knew I needed someone to help me so I started screaming and ran downstairs to find my friend’s mum. I found her and she ripped the dress off me. A neighbour immediately called an ambulance whilst her friends covered Crystal in wet blankets as they waited for paramedics to arrive. She was rushed to Southampton General Hospital where medics confirmed she had third degree burns to her stomach, arm and shoulder. She was quickly transferred to the specialist burns unit at Salisbury District Hospital. Fortunately, because I hadn’t fully hit puberty, the doctors at Salisbury left me to heal naturally instead of having skin graft surgery, she said. After three days the doctors ruled out infection and discharged Crystal.  She had to go back every other day for two weeks to change the dressing on her wounds but it soon became her mum’s responsibility as Crystal returned back to school after just two weeks. But as Crystal’s physical wounds began to heal it was clear the trauma of the event was still haunting her. She had recurring nightmares about fires and seeing a fire would set off a panic attack. Crystal was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder , a condition defined as ‘essentially a memory filing error caused by a traumatic event’. ‘I was so focused on my physical recovery that the mental recovery never occurred – and it hit me like a tonne of bricks,’ she said. ‘When I was first diagnosed I had a lot of nightmares which involved fire and bad things happening to me – I couldn’t sleep. ‘When I saw a fire in real life I would have intense panic attacks and get extremely upset.’ Crystal admits her emotional state was very ‘black and white’ she was either very happy or extremely depressed but desperately wanted to find a way to control her feelings.  After the incident, she was placed on the CAMHS cognitive behavioural therapy  waiting list, but it took over a year for her to receive the additional support. ‘At first I didn’t want the therapy because it was so long after my accident and I just wanted to put everything behind me and forget about it,’ Crystal said. ‘But I had a brilliant therapist and step by step I learnt how to deal with my PTSD and manage it so it doesn’t affect me as badly anymore.’ Now, two years after the traumatic event, Crystal has teamed up with Fixers – the charity that gives young people a voice – and made a film titled ‘Road to Recovery: Surviving Trauma’ to help encourage other PTSD sufferers to become ‘survivors instead of victims’. I think you have to have a reason to get better. As a young person I was thinking about my future and I had to think about my ambition and what I wanted to do but I wanted to get better for people, for my family – I wanted to stay strong for them.

Rosanna Sanderson was 14 weeks pregnant when she suddenly died at her home on Sunday. The 22-year-old had picked out baby names and was supposed to go for a gender scan in just a few weeks.  Her devastated mum Jacqueline told the Daily Record that she\u0027s asked to find out if the baby was a boy or a girl when a post-mortem is carried out so she can get the right colour of flowers at the funeral.   The post-mortem was due to be carried out on Wednesday to find out what caused the death of the seemingly fit and healthy hairdresser from Clarkston, near Glasgow. Jacqueline, 49, said: “Her baby was due on March 8 and we were supposed to go and get the gender scan soon. She had a big balloon for the reveal. “If it was a girl, she wanted to call her Lilly, and Oscar for a boy. “I have asked them to tell us after the post-mortem if the baby was a boy or a girl because I want to get the right flowers.  “She was in her prime and said, ‘This baby is going to be the making of me’. She said, ‘This baby is going to make me feel complete’. She would’ve made the best mum ever.” Rosanna was expecting with her former partner of four years Oliver, 28. The pair were both excited to become parents. Rosanna proudly posted a picture of her 12-week baby scan on her Facebook page last month and told friends how much she was looking forward to becoming a mum. In the early hours of Sunday, she had woken up and texted her mum and spoken to Oliver on the phone. They found her dead just an hour later. Jacqueline said: “I got a message at 4.30am. She said she had been sleeping. She had spoken to Oliver and was really happy talking to him.  “She wasn’t ill but she had previously complained of pins and needles in her arms and sore legs. “Everyone was saying they couldn’t get hold of Rosanna the next morning so I went around to her house and all the curtains were closed. “I was banging on her bedroom window really loud and there was no answer so I started to panic.” Jacqueline called Oliver, who came to the house with a key and the pair went inside together. She said: “I lifted the cover off her and knew she was gone. Her fingers were blue. I threw myself on top of her and told her I loved her. “She just looked like she had been sleeping. My heart breaks for Oliver having to see that.  “All she ever wanted was to be a mum. We went for the scan on August 27. She had been really worried before it, saying, ‘Mum, what if we go there and the baby’s not there?’ “When the baby came up on the screen, she burst out crying with happiness.” Rosanna – who had no known health problems and was a cheerleader at school – was unemployed but had been helping out at the Hair Lounge in Newton Mearns at weekends. Rosanna’s sister Angelina, 27, and brother Paul, 24, have been left devastated by her death. Jacqueline said her daughter had looked on her ex-partner Gordon Milligan, known as Spike, as a father figure and his parents Mabel and Ian as grandparents. She added friends, relatives and neighbours had been pulling together to get organised for the baby and knitting clothes. Jacqueline said: “She wanted a blue or pink teddy after the gender scan with the baby’s heartbeat inside. I so wish I had that now so I could keep it forever.

Prior to her divorce to Charles in August 1996, but during their separation, Diana took a string of lovers as she broke away from the royal family. Yesterday it was revealed one of those lovers, Oliver Hoare, had died from cancer aged 73. It\u0027s thought married Oliver, a father-of-three, began an affair with Diana in 1992. He was 16 years older than the princess, and the affair ended when his wife threatened him with divorce. Oliver, a close friend of Charles, was said to have been hounded by 300 malicious calls from Princess Diana after he ended the affair. Other lovers Diana took included protection officer Barry Mannakee, rugby legend Will Carling and cavalry officer James Hewitt.  The married close protection officer was a police officer with the Royal protection Squad and bodyguard to Diana. He was eventually transferred from his role as her protection officer following what was described as an inappropriate relationship between the two. In tapes recorded by Diana\u0027s voice coach, she admitted that in 1984 through to 1986, she had been deeply in love with someone who worked in this environment. While not referring to him by name, it\u0027s believed she was speaking about Mannakee. She told friends: He was my father figure and looked after me. Mannakee, 37, died in a motorbike accident in 1987. James Gilby   Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson\u0027s secret plan to leave their husbands and escape royal life  Diana\u0027s friend James Gilby Affectionately gave Diana the nickname of Squidgy. He was caught speaking to her on the Squidgygate phone tapes secretly recorded in 1989. He knew the princess since before her marriage to Charles and the recorded tapes caused huge controversy around how they were obtained. It\u0027s thought Diana\u0027s relationship with James was at its peak in 1989. Will Carling   Clever trick Meghan Markle uses to make sure she doesn\u0027t up-stage Prince Harry  Diana and rugby legend Will Carling met at a Chelsea gym. After an affair, Diana fell out with the sportsman when their relationship was revealed in 1995. Carling, who played for England, was married at the time of the affair with the princess. His wife criticised Diana\u0027s conduct during the fallout, while the princess said he had followed her like a puppy. Hasnat Khan   Princess Diana used clever trick at the gym to try and stop photographers taking her picture  Heart surgeon Hasnat Khan had a two-year relationship with Diana, starting in 1995. She is said to have described him as Mr Wonderful and the pair even considered marriage. Diana is thought to have seen Khan as the love of her life and even visited his family in Lahore, Pakistan. The cardiologist has never sought to cash in on their relationship after her death and has never revealed intimate details of their time together. Diana is thought to have ended the relationship in June 1997.

And the millionaire Old Etonian, whose death was announced on Tuesday, always knew exactly who made them. But he tried to protect his family from learning of his affair with Diana, who made the calls after he dumped her. With his death from cancer at 73, discreet Oliver has taken the full story of their tempestuous relationship to his grave. But he never knew Diana was sitting outside his house making the calls on her mobile. One of her closest friends revealed the extraordinary truth behind the calls, which were investigated by the politan Police in 1995.  They told the Mirror: “Diana was very naughty. She would drive to his house and park up outside and then call his house phone from her mobile. “She’d do it in the middle of the night, so she could watch the lights in the house go on as he scrambled to the phone. She would be there for hours, watching and calling. “She knew she couldn’t be with Hoare, because he was married. And while he might have been a gentleman, and a very entertaining one at that, it was his wife who actually had the money. “Diana would always say, ‘I know he will never leave his wife’. But she wasn’t used to not getting her way. So she would enjoy taunting him and reminding him she was there.  “She even asked her staff to ring his house number for her. She’d say, “Ring that number and then hang up’. Of course, no one knew then what they were doing then. “Diana was playing games in the relationship, but she enjoyed it. He was playing with fire when he started dating a princess, and he should have known he could get burnt.” Now, with Oliver’s death at his home in France, other friends have recalled their tempestuous relationship. Their affair was so passion\u0026shy\u0026shyate that Diana used to dream of running away with him. And Oliver used to hide in a pal’s car boot to get smuggled into \u0026shyKensington Palace for secret trysts. On one infamous occasion Oliver, enjoying a cigar after a night of passion, triggered the fire alarm at the palace. It set off the sprinklers and staff found him naked and sheepishly hiding behind a bay tree in the garden. He was told: “Mr Hoare, I think it’s time you went home, don’t you?” But once Oliver, a wealthy art expert, had decided to dump her, Diana became the ultimate woman scorned.  Fuelled by jealousy and Oliver’s decision to stay with his wife, she launched a vitriolic series of more than 300 nuisance calls to his family home. A friend said: “These calls showed the sheer depth and intensity of their relationship. She was deeply in love with him and could not understand being dropped. Oliver was very cool, and the incident involving the post-coital cigar setting off the alarms has gone down as one of the great anecdotes.” Diana’s friend Lady Elsa Bowker once recalled that she “daydreamed of living in Italy with the handsome Hoare”. Lady Bowker, who was 92 when she died in 2000 and had no children of her own, was a second mother to Diana. She knew Diana was “infatuated” with the married dad-of-three, embarking on a passionate four-year relationship during her failing marriage to Prince Charles, which ended in divorce in August 1996. Diana’s affair with Oliver began after her father’s death in 1992. He was just one of a string of lovers she took during her marriage. They included close protection officer Barry Mannakee, heart surgeon Hasnat Khan, England rugby union captain Will Carling and lifelong friend James Gilbey. Oliver was also a close pal of Charles, who once used his house in France to recuperate after a polo accident.  He was a student at Sorbonne University in Paris, before joining Christie’s auction house and going on to become a specialist in Islamic art. Diana’s friend confirmed Oliver occasionally sneaked into the palace in a car boot, but added: “He was a gentleman, so he would have been less pleased to get in the boot than [lover] James Hewitt or Hasnat Khan. “You knew when Hoare would be coming to visit because it was one of the few times Diana would order in champagne. She didn’t drink, but she’d always get a bottle of Krug on ice for him. “They would love a quiet dinner together. They were quite boring when they got together, but Diana liked that. “She liked having someone by her side, who worshipped her. She would dream of setting up home in Italy, then she wanted a chateau in France. For a while it was America. But when she realised all his toys were paid for by his wife, she knew it would never happen.” Oliver bought Diana a gold bracelet that she kept until she died in 1997. The friend said Prince Charles knew of the affair, adding: “It was an open secret. “And Charles knew. But what could he say? He wasn’t in a position to comment.” COMMENT by Paul Burrell, Diana\u0027s former butler "},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons stop serving jagerbombs swaps","story":"NewsWetherspoons to stop serving Jagerbombs as it swaps European spirits for non-EU equivalentsThe Pro Brexit pub chain is replacing some EU produced products with those from other countriesShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAlan JonesAmy Coles11:59, 12 SEP 2018Updated14:14, 12 SEP 2018NewsJagerbombs will no longer be on offer once the spirit used to make them is replaced \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPub company JD Wetherspoon will stop serving Jagerbombs later this month.

Environmental groups from around the world have voiced their outrage at the proposal, and called for further protection to be given to the animals. Activists claim that in spite of the ban - which has been in place for more than three decades - endangered whales are still being slaughtered in their thousands.  The controversial move comes after widespread condemnation of continued killings by whalers from Japan, Norway and Iceland.  Last month devastating pictures showed a whale foetus being dragged away to the trash after its mother was butchered in Iceland.  Activists have branded whaling - which sees the animals harpooned at least once before they die - as unnecessarily cruel. Officials from the International Whaling Commission in Brazil will this week decide whether the ban - which has been in place since 1986 - should be lifted. Japanese delegates claim many types of whale are not endangered and can be harvested sustainably. Since the ban was brought in, the Environmental Investigation Agency  claims more than 38,500 whales have been killed by whalers from Iceland, Norway and Japan. Japan claims it hunts for dolphins in order to carry out scientific research, which is legal under the 1986 ban.  Hunted whales are impaled with a grenade-tipped harpoon and towed to the shore with a rope so they can be butchered. Critics have branded the slaughter barbaric and called for sanctions against countries which allow whaling to take place. Charity ORCA, which works to protect whales and dolphins, blasted the whalers. Head of science and conservation, Lucy Babey, said: Subjecting them to this indescribable pain and suffering can only be defined as sickening inhumanity it is quite simply heartbreaking. A statement from the EIA said: Despite the global ban, Japan, Norway and Iceland continue commercial whaling.

I think it might be good for both of us.”While Kamara has remained in Scotland this week for treatment, Kallman is off on international duty, though not with the full squad.But while, after winning his first full cap earlier this year, he appears to be dropping a level as he joins the U/21 squad for two vital Euro qualifiers, he’s happy.The 20-year-old is very much of the opinion that his near-certain involvement against Denmark and Poland will be a case of taking one step back to make two forward.The Dens loan signing from Turku doesn’t hide from the fact he would love to have competed at the higher level.For him, though, time on the park is what matters most and that’s why he’s more than happy to be representing his country in the younger age group.“Of course you always want to go forward and I heard back in Finland they were looking to put new players into the team and the manager said I was one of the options,” he said.“However, then again you have to think about that. Now I am in the U/21s and we have two qualifier games.“I’ve played with them all the time and am going to play as the first striker for them. You have to know which are the best moments to go to the first team because, if I go to the U/21s, I’ll get playing time and we have two games to try to qualify with them.“For that reason I think it might be better to be with the U/21s to get playing time. If I got called up to the first team, yes, I would be there but how much playing time will I get, I don’t know.“It’s easier to say afterwards because you don’t know how much time you will get but with the U/21s I know I am guaranteed playing time.”And the benefit to Dundee of his trip back to the continent should be the competitive nature of the action he sees.Not only are the opposition he’ll face of a decent standard, there’s plenty of stake in the fixtures.If the young Finns can win both, they would still be in with a chance of qualifying for the Euro finals, though the history of the group so far does suggest they will have their work cut out.When they faced the Danes at home last year they were on the wrong end of a 5-0 drubbing, so to beat them in the away tie will be a big ask.Kallman, though, is up for the challenge and is determined to do all his can to at least extend Finnish interest in qualification.“These will be a tough two games. They are the deciders for us because teams are four and five points ahead of us in the table with Poland first and Denmark second.“We have to at least not lose these game to still have a chance to proceed.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/06/BrewDog-2-e1496670653794.jpg ","title":"brewdog to hand out free beer in dundee today but you need to be prepared","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBrewDog has announced an international ‘Bad Beer Amnesty’ giving drinkers the opportunity to swap any mainstream lager for a pint of its new headliner beer, Lost Lager, which hits its bars today. 100vw, 3500px\" /BrewDog in Dundee\u0026#8217s Panmure Street will have a designated ‘Bad Beer Bin’ where visitors can dump their unwanted cans of beer in exchange for a pint of BrewDog.They will be accepting cans from midday to closing time on 12th September 2018 in all participating bars.Each person who swaps a can of ‘bad beer’ will be entitled to one free pint of Lost Lager.The initiative to get drinkers to upgrade their lagers will be available in all BrewDog’s UK bars, as well as its Barcelona, Berlin and Brussels bars in mainland Europe.The move is to celebrate Lost Lager being stocked by Tesco and Booker nationwide from today, in 330ml bottles, 330ml cans, and 660ml bottles.BrewDog cofounder James Watt said: “Lost Lager is our best lager to date a crisp, clean pilsner with hints of spice and a zesty lime marmalade character.\u0026#8220To mark its launch, we wanted to give beer drinkers a chance to taste a lager made with soul and passion, rather than the mass-produced fizzy yellow swill that the big breweries have been peddling for years.\u0026#8220So, bin your Budweiser, say farewell to Fosters, and get your hands on a pint of Lost Lager.” “For decades, the craft of lager has been lost and forgotten, bastardised by mega breweries putting profit before flavour.\u0026#8220But brewed right, lager can pack huge flavour and offer a really exciting style with depth and character.

We missed two penalties and we were always in the game until the last two goals went in later in the second half.“So, I think the score was harsh on us in the end but you still don’t want to lose five goals in any game and you want to defend better.”Looking forward, he suspects Alloa will not be much changed from the side that drew with United in the Championship last weekend“I think they don’t have a massive squad so it could be similar to the league game against us on Saturday. They are a good, fit and organised outfit. It will be a hard game.”As was the case in the first-round victory over St Johnstone Colts last month, the United ranks at Tannadice on Saturday are likely to be bolstered by several first-team men.And young midfielder Archie Thomas is back in contention for a starting place.He was injured in the first minute of the first-round victory but returned for half an hour of Monday’s game.United have set the entry price for Saturday’s game at £10.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b618c05b50b5-923x564.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlos new boys are showing some promise at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt remains early days so far as judging new-look Dundee United goes but there is no question Csaba Laszlo’s team are getting to know each other.After a sticky start to the season, there have been definite signs over the last three, unbeaten, Championship outings that the team is coming together.And the Tele takes a look and how the new men have contributed, so far.Matej RakovanAfter joining up on the same day as fellow-goalie Benjamin Siegrist, one of the big questions going into the campaign was which of the pair would get the nod. It was the Slovakian and, so far, he’s justified the faith shown in him with a string of impressive performances. He did make an error for the goal lost against Partick, but by then the game had been comfortably won.Frederic FransThe Belgian was added to the squad to provide steel in central defence and the fact he had experience of the Scottish game from a spell with Partick made him a sensible addition. So far he’s lived up to expectations and looked a strong and calming influence.Paul WatsonProbably the most low key signing, at first it seemed doubtful if the man who was a squad player at Falkirk would feature too often. Given his chance at Queen of the South last month, the powerful centre-half grabbed the opportunity and impressed in each of his three league games to date, scoring three goals in the process. With the arrival of Rachid Bouhenna, he still faces a challenge to keep his place.Christoph RabitschThe Austrian has had a robust start to his United career and a couple of rash tackles when he was already on a booking have seen him subbed to prevent the team being reduced to 10 men. The 22-year-old was publicly slapped down by Csaba for that. He appears to have taken it on board and there’s no question his ability to get in about opponents is an asset.Adam BartonCaptured from Partick Thistle just before the Betfred Cup games kicked off, the tall Englishman has added to United’s new-found aerial strength. Most of his appearances so far have been in midfield, so he’ll face a challenge once skipper Fraser Fyvie returns from injury, but he’s also been used in central defence and that versatility has given the manager more options.Fraser AirdOne of the first signings of the summer, the Canadian has added pace in the wide areas. He earned his move on the strength of performances against United for Dunfermline last term and, so far, he might just have been the best of the new bunch.Yannick LoembaThe winger was an unknown quantity who hadn’t had much football in the last year or so. However, there’s been no evidence of that and he’s made a lightning start to his time with United. The 28-year-old always wants on the ball and his eagerness to get forward has made him a fans’ favourite.Pavol SafrankoThe loan signing from Aalborg marked his debut with an excellent goal in the win at Queen of the South and has looked the part since. Well-known to the manager from their time together in his native Slovakia, Safranko looks to be the centre-forward United have been crying out for.Craig CurranA dead leg picked up in pre-season delayed his involvement until the opening league game when Dunfermline won at Tannadice. As his fitness has improved after that injury, Curran has shown himself to be a hard worker and chipped in with a goal against Partick.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b92a037afa2f.jpg ","title":"dundee council set to net seven figure sum for sell off of waterfront land","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA residential site at the Waterfront is set to be snapped up for a seven-figure sum this week, the Tele has learned.Councillors are to meet on tonight to discuss a number of land sell-offs to allow further development in Dundee.Among the areas that will be discussed behind closed doors is the newly-approved residential block to be built on Site 6, across the road from the V\u0026ampA.Ediston Real Estate, which submitted the planning application to build the flats, was among the bidders for the land, the deed for which still rests with Dundee City Council.It has reportedly submitted a bid of £1.45 million.However, the Tele has learned that Robertson Capital Projects has come in with a higher bid which is likely to be approved tonight.Robertson Capital – part of the Robertson Group, which is also building the office block on Site 6 – is understood to have submitted a bid of £1.6m for the right to build on the site.A source said: “The meeting will decide on the sale of the area which will have the block of flats built on it. The council still owns the site at the moment.“The architects and developers who lodged the application said they wouldn’t buy the land until they were given planning permission.“Ediston Real Estate put in a bid but it has been outbid by Robertson Capital, which has submitted a bid of £1.6m.“It is very likely that it will get waved through on Monday.”Discussions on the deal are to be held in private, with few details of the meeting publicly available.The plan to build 99 flats on Site 6 were approved by councillors last month following Ediston’s application. The block will sit on the north-eastern corner of the site, away from the office block currently under construction that overlooks the V\u0026ampA.A total of eight plots have been earmarked for Site 6, with a central courtyard in the middle.At last month’s planning committee, councillors disagreed over the decision not to require planners to include parking spaces at the complex for residents.Conservative West End councillor Donald Hay had attempted to stop the development but could not find a seconder to enable his motion to be put to a vote.Mr Hay said he was concerned at the number of flats being built without parking in the city centre.However, former city development chief Mike Galloway said people would be able to apply for the residents’ parking scheme, which would give them access to city centre multi-storey car parks.He added that the council could build further parking facilities in the city centre if demand was identified but there were as yet no plans to do so.The nearest car park is the Greenmarket multi-storey, a few minutes’ walk away.The city council declined to comment.The Robertson Group and Ediston Real Estate had not responded to a request for comment at the time of going to press.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b8e4d427df01-507x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united must win dirty games laments csaba laszlo","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn the wake of Saturday’s 1-1 draw at Alloa, Dundee United boss Csaba Laszlo still cuts a frustrated figure.The Terrors, and Csaba, had been on a high after comfortable wins over Queen of the South and Partick Thistle saw them, seemingly, turn a corner.United controlled and managed those matches well but all their good work came undone as they laboured to a point at the Indodrill Stadium at the weekend.Csaba had spoken at the start of the season about his side’s need to start grinding out results if they want to win the Championship.And his disappointment and anger was evident as they couldn’t dictate what he called a ‘dirty game’ in Clackmannanshire.“It was a dirty game but one which really, if you want to make the top league, you have to manage all the time and finish,” he said.“This is not about dominating the game, it’s about winning the game.“It is clear for us that this was an artificial pitch and even it was seven, eight yards shorter than usually.“So I wait for my team and it’s clear, in this case, you have to circulate the ball quicker, you have to move the ball out quicker to have the possibility to move up the pitch.”United had opened the scoring in the second half through a Paul Watson header on 71 minutes, his third goal in two games, and it could have been more.Yannick Loemba had what would have been his first strike for the Tangerines ruled out for offside and Csaba felt 18-year-old Declan Glass could have played in fellow-sub Callum Booth to put the game beyond doubt.As it transpired, the kid gave away possession and Alloa broke to win the free-kick which Iain Flannigan curled home on 82 minutes to earn the Wasps a point.It was no less than the home side deserved but Csaba couldn’t help scrutinise his team’s game management.“We were in front, you have just to keep the ball and keep the result,” he added.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b9788f30af25-609x564.jpg ","title":"ex dundee midfielder kevin mcdonald believes scotland are good enough to top nations league group","story":"\t\t\t\t\tKevin McDonald believes the Uefa Nations League has allowed Scotland to find their spirit.The former Dundee man insists the new competition, brought in to replace mid-season friendlies, has given a competitive edge to international football the Scots thrive under.Evidence of its effect on the national team came on Monday night as they ran out 2-0 winners over Albania at a rain-drenched Hampden Park.Alex McLeish’s side dominated most of the 90 minutes, with the visitors only really threatening on the break, and took control in the second half.A Berat Djimshiti own goal on 47 minutes, which many in attendance thought was a Steven Naismith goal, and one on 68 minutes which was no doubt the Hearts man’s, saw Scotland rise to the top of Group C1.And 29-year-old McDonald was delighted with the result and performance.“We dominated most of the game and never really felt under too much pressure and it was a real solid performance,” he said.“Right from the first minute we set our stall out and it went on the full 90 minutes that way.“The gaffer wants us to try to play and build up a bit but when we lose the ball he wants us to press straight away.“That’s exactly what we did and it worked fantastic.“You could hear the crowd were happy with the performance and we really stuck together out there.“On another day it could be 5-0. We won 2-0 and I was buzzing for Naisy to get a couple of goals.“It was a positive night.”When asked about whether the squad find the new Uefa Nations League beneficial, the Carnoustie-raised midfielder added: “Friendlies are different, it’s hard with friendlies being so laid back.“Now the chance of the Nations League – it’s fantastic for everyone involved.“Those competitive games are fantastic to play. There was a real spirit among the boys and we looked good.”Ahead of their next group clash away to Israel next month, McDonald hopes an attractive style of play and positive results can bring fans back.Just 17,455 were at Hampden on Monday night to witness Scotland’s first win under McLeish as the future of the national stadium remains shrouded in doubt.“To get the fans back on our side they want to see some good football and they want to see us winning and we can only do that by putting in performances.“I’m sure if we continue to do that the fans will come back.“Regardless of if it’s home or away we want to go out and win, it’s that simple.“We’re going to try to win every single game we can and putting in performances like Monday night then, if we continue to play that way, I’m sure we’ll be close to winning that group.”And McDonald hopes to continue to be involved in a dark blue shirt, as long as he can stay in the Fulham starting line-up.After making the step up to the Premier League this season, the West London club have invested heavily in their squad.However, McDonald believes the competition for places can only benefit himslef and fellow-Scot Tom Cairney – not included in the latest squad.He added: “We’ve brought in some high-quality players and we know there’ll be a lot of rotation this season which is probably what we need.“We’re all aiming towards the same goal to stay in the Premier League and I want to play as much as I can.“It’s good the manager lives that way, he lives not far from Fulham, so that can only be a positive especially with the football we’re playing. He’s been impressed with myself and Tom so, hopefully, it stays that way.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"i was looking to see if i could go elsewhere ex celtic kid paul mcmullan back from the brink at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWinger Paul McMullan has revealed there was a real chance of him leaving Dundee United before the transfer window closed a week ago.And the former Scotland U/21 international can’t rule out being on the move when the next window opens in January.However, between now and then, the former Celtic kid, who was brought to Tannadice by Ray McKinnon before the start of last season, insists his only focus will be on winning back a regular first-team place.That fight will continue in today’s Irn-Bru Cup second-round clash with Alloa, a game McMullan concedes he might not have been involved in.“The speculation last week, it was true. I was having a look to see if I could go elsewhere because the playing time here has been limited,” he said.“In the end there wasn’t anything that I felt attracted me more than Dundee United did, so that’s why I’m still here.“The club had made it pretty clear to me that, if I wanted to move on, they weren’t going to stand in my way, they’d let me go.“Between now and January I’ve got to get my head down and try to get time on the park.“And when it comes to January I will re-evaluate because I will only have six months on my contract left. I will have to look at it.“Right now, though, I’m just doing my best to try to get back into the team and see how that works. I’m not looking at anything else, I’m just focused on getting in the team and contributing.”With that in mind he is not looking at tomorrow and the Irn-Bru Cup, a competition United have made clear is not a priority this term, with any sense of disdain.He sees it as another chance to show manager Csaba Laszlo, who’s likely to be watching from the stand as reserve manager Craig Easton takes charge of the team, he should be in the starting line-up every week.For fans turning up, history suggests McMullan’s presence could mean they will be in for another late show.When the teams met at the same stage this time last year, he and Willo Flood struck deep in injury time to earn United victory.And in the first round this season, it was McMullan’s last-gasp strike that secured a remarkable comeback win over St Johnstone Colts, who’d been two up late on. This time he’d settle for the winner to come a little earlier than that.“I’ve done that a couple of times with late goals in this cup,” he added.“Hopefully, we don’t leave it until that late again and the boys can do well and get into the next round.“It would be nice to have a more straightforward victory but it is going to be a hard game and we saw at the weekend how tough it is playing against Alloa.“We just have to take it as it comes and see how we get on.”With Alloa expected to be along the same lines as when they lined up against United in the Championship last Saturday, McMullan knows making the third round could be a big ask.“I wouldn’t think they will make too many changes but it’s an opportunity for us to show what we do and we will try to take it.“It will be a good learning process for the younger ones in our team and a good test against seasoned pros who know what the game is all about.“For me, it’s an opportunity to show what I can do and that’s what I have to keep on doing.“I feel I’ve done OK, it’s just the chances haven’t been there for one reason or another and there’s not a lot I can do about that.“All I can do is stay patient and, if an opportunity comes, do all you can to make sure I take it as best I can.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b963815b248d-769x564.jpg ","title":"return of fraser fyvie provides fizz as youthful dundee united exit irn bru cup","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Irn-Bru Cup might not matter to Dundee United but Saturday’s second-round clash with Alloa at Tannadice might just prove to be one of the most significant days in their season.Craig Easton’s mix of kids and fringe players showed guts and character but just fell short as they lost the lead late on before exiting on penalties.As was signalled by less than 1,000 home fans turning up, however, few connected with the Tangerines will be bothered about that.What was both important and a massive positive, was the sight of club captain Fraser Fyvie making his long-awaited return from injury.Fyvie hadn’t been seen on Tannadice since two days before Christmas when a serious knee injury ended his season.Given the difference in results with and without him last term, it could be strongly argued the minute he went down clutching his knee also effectively killed off the campaign for the team as a whole.Now he’s back, manager Csaba Laszlo will be hoping he has the same influence as during his opening months at the club.Encouraging as the sight of him running on was, he will, of course, still need time to get up to speed in terms of match sharpness.Accordingly, the plan is for a few reserve outings to build strength and stamina before he returns to the full first team for the all- important Championship action.For Laszlo and the fans that time can’t come soon enough but those who turned up on Saturday were at least given glimpses of just how much he has to offer.There were a couple of passes from deep that turned defence into attack in an instant and a thunderous free-kick that provided the final action of game time and would have seen his return capped with a dramatic winner had it not be for a fine save from Neil Parry in the Alloa goal.Indeed, in a strange 90 minutes that saw the visitors dominate possession at times, but for Parry, Easton could have been looking forward to the third round.Over the piece, Alloa did more of the attacking but lacked the quality up front to finish off the good approach work.Often hitting on the break, United were able to create clear chances but found Parry in top form.After a crisp Matty Smith strike had given United the lead against the run of play on 15 minutes, Parry was soon denying the same player with an excellent stop, though somehow Greg Aitken failed to spot his touch and awarded a goal kick.Parry’s ability was recognised before the interval when he then made a superb stop to touch a Paul McMullan free-kick round the post.And he was the hero in the opening minutes of the second period as he plucked a Declan Glass 18-yarder out of the air, then did very well to beat away an Archie Thomas strike.For all that, Alloa continued to look a threat and when they were finally given a clear chance, from the penalty spot, Alan Trouten made no mistake, sending the ball past Benjamin Siegrist for the equaliser.If Jim Goodwin’s team fancied their chances of going on to get a winner in 90 minutes, they had further cause to be grateful to their goalkeeper as he denied Thomas and Fyvie in injury time to take the tie to a penalty shootout.It saw nine of the 10 spot-kicks expertly despatched via the use of power, only for the otherwise excellent Thomas opting for placement instead, giving Parry his most routine stop.It was the deciding moment, but for once a defeat included a bigger positive than the negative of losing.That came on 70 minutes when Fyvie strode out on the pitch.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b45cc3d57c90-e1531308229935.jpg ","title":"revealed these are the men dundee fans want in charge if neil

Artwork for Dennis the Menace stripThe Beano was first published by DC Thomson in 1938 and its style went on to define the look and tone of British comics. This artwork by David Law was made for publication on April 30 1960. Hand-coloured and with pencil annotations, the speech bubbles were made separately and have been glued on.3. Valkyrie tiaraMore than 2,500 diamonds were used to create this headpiece, the last of its type ever made by Cartier. The fashion for Valkyrie tiaras originated on the stage before being adopted by fashionable aristocrats at the start of the 20th century. This one was commissioned by Mary Crewe-Milnes, Duchess of Roxburghe, in 1935.4. Costume worn by Natalie Portman in Star Wars: Attack of the ClonesStar Wars fans will delight in seeing one of Padme Amidala\u0026#8217s intricately-designed gowns up close. The embroidered dress and cloak were created by Glasgow designer Trisha Biggar, who said around three-quarters of all Padme\u0026#8217s dresses \u0026#8220have got a touch of Scottish vintage on them somewhere\u0026#8221. The costume is on loan from The Lucas Museum of Narrative Art in Los Angeles.5. The largest remaining fragment of the TitanicFound floating in the Atlantic, the detailed wooden panel fragment is from an over-door in the first-class lounge of the doomed liner that sank in 1912. The museum says: \u0026#8220Executed in Louis XV style with Rococo motifs and forms, it demonstrates the extraordinary quality of the decoration on board the Titanic.\u0026#8221 On loan from the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b9787de217c4-846x564.jpg ","title":"va dundee opening weekend stomping start to 3d festival","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFive hundred young people from across the city are set to bring a stomping start to the opening of V\u0026ampA Dundee on Friday.The youngsters will perform a dance alongside a cast of nine professional contemporary dancers and three guest dancers from Scottish Ballet.Rehearsals for the specially commissioned performance, part of the 3D Festival, have been taking place at Dundee and Angus College and the University of Dundee’s playing fields.

with launch of new service that stops off at all city centre attractions","story":"\t\t\t\t\tLocal bus firm Xplore Dundee is ready to take a “leap of faith” next week when it launches a new city centre service on a three-month trial.The 360 City Circle bus will link all of the centre\u0026#8217s tourist attractions in a single 20-minute route, connecting the bus and train stations along the way.Christine McGlasson, managing director of Xplore, said the firm was stepping into the unknown with the new route.But she hopes tourists and locals alike will embrace the service during its trial run.“This is the right time to run a service like this,” said Christine.“We want to help people get around the city centre easily and folk have been calling out for a service like this for years.“It really is a leap of faith though – we’re just taking a chance on something we think people will use.“And if ever there was a time to try it out, it’s now.“Hopefully, we can get make a big success of it – we need people to get on board for that.”Xplore has secured the loan of a £220,000 demonstrator bus from Northern Irish firm Wrightbus for the three-month trial.Tourists boarding the bus – which has eye-catching electric green livery featuring graphics of city landmarks – can pick up a brochure showing them the full route, as well as links to other services to places further afield, such as Broughty Ferry.The all-electric bus can operate all day without having to be charged, running from 8am-5.30pm at a fixed price of £3 for adults and £2 for children.Should the trial be considered a success, Xplore hopes to either extend its lease of the bus or find money to buy one of its own.Christine added: “The fact is there is a need for this service.“If it is successful, then brilliant – but if need be, we will look into subsidies such as low emission grants and tourism grants to keep it going.“It will all depend on how people use it.“We’re looking into things such as a recording played over the speakers telling people about their next stops, and tying it into tickets like Plusbus, which you can buy when you buy a train ticket to Dundee.“It’s trying to cater for all – local people to give them the connectivity, and people coming in to discover the city.”The Tele joined the 360’s inaugural run around the 2.65-mile route, taking in the Waterfront, Overgate, Verdant Works, McManus and Foxlake.The eco-friendly bus – which can recapture energy lost during braking to keep the battery charged – is zero-emission, apart from a tiny diesel generator used to heat the interior.Among the passengers on the City Circle’s first run were city council development chief Mike Galloway, North East Labour MSP Jenny Marra and local B\u0026ampB owners Barrie and Olwyn Jack. Mr Galloway said: “With the Waterfront coming to fruition and becoming a reality, a service linking everything together is another piece in the puzzle.“I hope it is really successful and does well.”Ms Marra said: “I think it’s great – the more public transport in Dundee the better it is for getting around.“It’s also really important that they’re using an economical bus. It’s great for the environment and I would like to see even more environmentally-friendly buses in the area.”Barrie and Olwyn, who run Duntrune House north of the city, say they think the 360 is a “great idea”.Olwyn added: “It’s excellent for people who come into Dundee that don’t have their bearings, linking everything up.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"                          POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"book-your-christmas-party-venue-at-one-of-these-five-festive-spots","story":"                          Whether you can believe it or not, the time for festive planning is here.

It has been handed in to the council.A spokeswoman for the Highland LGBTI forum, which is organising the rally, said Mr Morrison was entitled to his opinions,\"I have no problem with him or the people who have signed the petition holding their views and I totally respect that but there are a lot of other people who don\u0026rsquot hold those views,\" she said.\"You will always get people who don\u0026rsquot like LGBT stuff.\"Referring to his comments about people frolicking on rainbow-coloured floats, she said: \"Basically this is a celebration and if he doesn\u0026rsquot like people dancing and enjoying themselves, I could see that would be a problem for him.\"She said there was nothing illegal about the proposed parade.\"Obviously, nothing untoward will be happening during the march,\" she said. \"It will be totally family-friendly.\"He has a moral objection which is his personal objection and he is perfectly entitled to that. He should not try to enforce his moral objection on everyone else.\"Eastgate Shopping Centre has given its permission for the march to start at Falcon Square.The main event hub will be at Eden Court

been looking at the possibility of introducing a gift card which can be used at Bid member businesses and encourage more people to support their local economy.Bid manager Mike Smith confirmed the idea was under consideration and he would be reporting to the board on the proposal within the next few weeks.He said: \"There is a fair degree of investment involved and risk attached because you have to meet the cost of setting the whole thing up and there are different ways of doing it.\"But it is something we will have a look at because we need to encourage engagement with our businesses.\"A gift card scheme was launched in Elgin earlier this year by the town\u0027 own Bid, known as Elgin Embrace, and has attracted interest from Inverness.It is one of more than 20 towns and cities around the UK using a gift card developed by former Highland resident Colin Munro and his company Miconex.Perth, the West End district of Glasgow, Sheffield and Cardiff are among the locations which have set up their own schemes.Some 70 businesses, including national chains and local independents, have signed up to the Elgin gift card.However, Elgin Embrace manager Gill Neill warned that a successful gift card scheme required a large initial investment.\"We did it on behalf of all our members because it is an incredibly expensive programme to put together,\" she said.\"Set up costs are in the region of \u0026pound20,000, so you will find that most of the town gift cards are being run by business improvement districts on behalf of their membership.\"The businesses in the town have been really, really responsive and really positive, but I think a big part of that is we are covering the costs.\"I strongly suspect that if we had not and had been asking people to pay, you would not have had the same uptake.\"The initiative has also been well received by shoppers in the town.\"The public see it as a very positive thing,\" she added.\"Rather than being given a specific gift card that they use in one shop, they get an Elgin Gift Card that they can used in one of the 70 places in the town.\"They can use it to buy clothes, get their hair done, have a meal or put it towards a holiday or buying furniture.\"People are still very positive about embracing the Shop Local message and we hope this will encourage people to perhaps visit businesses they have never used before.\"From the point of

not many people bought wedding dresses brand new in the 1980s, so she felt she was doing a good turn by selling it.But she was speechless when it turned up again after so many years.\"I actually

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live life as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them. Throughout September, headline partner M\u0026ampS will be selling a selection of limited edition coffee morning products \u0026#8211 including lots of cakes, biscuits and two exclusive mugs \u0026#8211 with 10 per cent of proceeds going to Macmillan.Homes, workplaces and communities from the Shetland Islands to Land’s End will be hosting coffee mornings this year readers in Argyll and Bute can find events nearby using the interactive map on the Coffee Morning website www.macmillan.org.uk/coffee.Thank you to everyone who gets involved.Joanna Lumley, actress and Macmillan supporterSir,The SNP announced it is starting up a new \u0026#8216fact-checking\u0026#8217 service to monitor the accuracy of research and political statements.Many people in Scotland will be wondering if the SNP will be fact-checking the cost of its new independence blueprint.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most individual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary.

Joe Chapman, 23, is taking part in this September’s Great Scottish Run following the tragic death of his pregnant wife, Holly Chapman, to cystic fibrosis when she was just 23 years old. Holly was aged just one and a half when she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and although she was in and out of hospital regularly, it was something she kept very private to those around her. Joe said: “Holly and I met at the school we both attended down in England. “We started going out in 2010 and got married in August 2015. “I only found out she had the condition after about eight months of us being together. It wasn’t something she really spoke about, she just dealt with it. “It was probably around 2012 that we noticed her health slowly deteriorating. “She would be in hospital around two to three times a year for a two-week period to go on an IV drip to boost her immune system and clear chest infections. “Every year since then she would be in hospital more and more.” Due to Holly needing IV drips more frequently, Joe and Holly’s Mum received training to give Holly IV drips from home, rather than being in hospital for long periods at a time. On November 27, 2017 Holly found out she was pregnant, but at the same time her health was beginning to deteriorate at a much faster rate. Joe said: “Holly was needing to be in hospital for around six to seven weeks at a time. “I remember her being let out for six days at Christmas but she really couldn’t do much herself, she got too out of breath. “I had to carry her up and down the stairs and help her get dressed. She was also permanently on oxygen.” This continued through until March 8 this year, where Holly had a fit at home and was taken away in an ambulance to Ayr Hospital. She was transferred to a specialist unit in Glasgow, where her health got slightly better over the next couple of days. Joe added: “The specialist advised if she didn’t improve, that we should consider aborting our baby. On March 13, Holly became so ill that we decided it was time to let her be at peace and we made the decision to turn off her ventilator. Holly left the world far too young due to this horrible disease. “Cystic fibrosis is a really common disease but not many people know much about it which I why I decided to take part in the Great Scottish Run, to raise awareness and also raise vital funds for the trust.” You can sponsor Joe via his JustGiving page: https:www.justgiving/fundraising/joe-chapman9Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr HospitalCystic FibrosisCharityAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrs station hotel undergo 24","story":"NewsAyr\u0027s Station Hotel to undergo 24 hour rescue operation aimed at re-opening platforms to ScotRail trainsThe crumbling building is the subject of a large exclusion zone which has rendered much of Ayr station a no-go zone.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:43, 11 SEP 2018NewsStation Hotel in Ayr \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA painstaking mission aimed at re-opening parts of Ayr railway station is to get underway. Safety teams will work 24 hours a day to try and get the hub moving again. Work, which begins this Saturday, is expected to last until mid-October. Council bosses hope their move will reduce the extended exclusion zone which has paralysed the town\u0027s train station. Services to Glasgow Central are currently restricted in size with all six carriage trains halting at Prestwick Town. All trains south of Ayr are cancelled. Contractors are now set to move in with the aim of reinstating those lost services. Council chief executive, Eileen Howat, said: The extended exclusion zone at the train station – and its impact on rail services – is far from ideal, but we’ve had to take this action to keep people safe and that’s something we cannot, and will not, take any chances with. Our priority right now is to do what’s needed to allow the extended exclusion zone to be reduced when safe to do so and for rail services to get back to normal, and that’s exactly what we’re doing.  Once that has been achieved, we will continue to progress the wider programme of public safety works as well as the works to complete a structural survey, which will help inform the next steps with regards to the building’s future.   Andrew Mackie, Transport Scotland’s Head of Rail Franchising, added: In the longer term, any solution identified must contribute to the economic prosperity of the town centre and the communities south of Ayr currently without a train service.  This means we need to explore all the available options for dealing with the Station Hotel property which, in its current state, presents a significant safety risk not only to the railway line but also the immediate vicinity.  Only by continuing to work in close partnership with the relevant agencies and the local community can we reach an effective solution for everyone concerned - particularly those passengers, the local community and businesses directly affected.   ScotRail Head of Service Planning, Dave Smith, said: The beginning of the works to remove the extended exclusion zone is a fantastic step forward and until then we are working flat out to keep our customers moving.

Debby McKenzie had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis with a future that looked downhill all the way. She admits not in her wildest dreams could she have imagined her life now. Debby, who turned 50 on Tuesday, is just back from a three-month odyssey to Uganda. It was her first visit after setting up the charity McKenzie Clinic which focuses on children with the worst medical conditions. Some remote parts of the country she went to were a 10-hour drive over pot-holed dirt roads from her base in the capital Kampala. And she found herself packed in the back of overcrowded people carriers, with chickens running loose at her feet. Debby, who grew up in Prestwick but now lives in Ayr, said: “It is not very nice to be perfectly honest. It is a country with nothing. “It was always my dream to go to Africa and do some volunteer work, but it has escalated into a full blown charity which I registered in May 2017.” She has used her networking skills to bring volunteers together and they fund operations and aftercare for the children. Uganda was declared independent from Britain in 1962 and is landlocked, though you would not realise it, as the vast Lake Victoria straddles half its southern border. The great lake is 85 per cent the size of Scotland. The population is about 42 million and seems to attract dictators – Idi Amin during the seventies the most notorious. And it is dirt poor, says Debby, with lost of aid going to line the pockets of the rich. She flew into Entebbe and then headed to her host family in the capital where she stayed. From there, she visited ious organisations in all parts of the country. Debby, a divorced mum-of-one, revealed: “The roads are a nightmare and I always went by public transport. You get chickens at your feet and chickens on the roof. “It is very backward and for a couple of years I had been supporting charities there and they invited me over, so I decided I would go.” It is estimated some of the charities Debby was donating to were only able to get 30 per cent of funds to the people who needed them, the rest going to buy luxury goods for the elite. Debby said: “The aftercare is so important, I didn’t want them to be operated on then we walk away. “They have no life, no food and are malnourished. So I find sponsors to get them food weekly, mattresses and try and get them schooling. “We have just enrolled a girl into college who wants to be a hairdresser and we have paid the first year’s fee and accomodation. “People are joining the charity all the time as they want to help and I have been able to build a medical team on the ground in Uganda. “I have a huge online team of volunteers.” Debby was an independent financial adviser but eventually had to give up the business when she was diagnosed with MS 19 years ago.  She said: “I spent years not being able to see out of my right eye, I couldn’t speak, I lost my  co-ordination and I was paralysed down my right side.  “I was bed-ridden for a good couple of years.” She buried herself in research, went on to natural medications, exercised and changed her diet. Combined with a positive mental attitude it actually worked – and she is now sympton and fatigue free. Debby went on: “I really thought my life was over. But it is not, and it is now my time to help others.” The charity has seven acres of ground and the next project is to build a medical village and eco farm. Volunteers pay to get themselves out to Africa, but the charity pays for accomodation, transport and food. Debby added: “My big thing at the moment is we dont just want to operate or treat the children, we want to make sure they are going to be ok. “Everywhere you go you see horrific surgical cases, some of it is mind-blowing. “Most of the time I just have to step over them and walk away because I cannot help everyone. That is the hardest part.” Debby’s daughter Jessica,28, said: “Mum found an African surgeon, Dr Allan Lubiite, who also was deeply concerned about the conditions that Ugandan families were living in. “Mum’s work has helped save many children already and is funded solely from 15,000 people who are part of her Facebook groups. “She calls herself the voice of the voiceless and I am so proud of her.” A fundraiser is being held at the Berkeley Hotel in Barns Street, Ayr on Monday September 17 in the shape of a psychic and BBQ evening. It is being held to cover the expenses of volunteers while they are part of a dentistry team heading to Uganda at the end of the year. Just turn up at the door at 6.30pm.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsFacebookSocial mediaCharityPrestwick"},{"url":null,"title":"people given say regeneration ayr","story":"NewsPeople are to be given a say on regeneration of Ayr town centreAn \u0027Olympic\u0027 class swimming pool earmarked to replace CitadelShare\u0026nbspBySarah Hilley12:46, 11 SEP 2018Updated09:50, 12 SEP 2018NewsCitadel Leisure Centre Ayr\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn “Olympic” class swimming pool is earmarked for Ayr High Street to replace the aging Citadel, writes Sarah Hilley And the recently cleared Riverside block will become a public square, radical new council proposals reveal. A museum in the Town Hall and a drive to convert empty shop units for housing have also been put forward. It is all part of South Ayrshire Council’s answer to save the ailing High Street and politicians are launching a consultation to get feedback. Revealing the masterplan, council leader Douglas Campbell said: “The Citadel is coming to the end of its useful life. We would like to speak to people about moving the swimming pool into the middle of the town.” Deputy council leader Brian McGinley said: “There is potential for an Olympic style swimming pool. We need Ayr to be a destination. “If we move it to the town centre we will have other businesses coming in because of the increased footfall.” Replacing the High Street with an easy clean surface to get rid of chewing gum and other grime is another proposal to clean up the town. Council offices have been ruled out for good at the Riverside site after public protest over designs. Instead council staff would work at the newly refurbished old Clydesdale Bank building, other existing offices and a new archives base at Ayr Academy. Councillor Campbell said: “It will be a large public square and we want to ask people if they think it is a good idea.” Planning rules are to be changed so empty ground floor shops can be transformed into homes. Councillor Campbell said: “We need to reduce the number of shops in Ayr. One way to do that is to move residential accommodation down to the ground floor. We want to encourage residential development at the bottom of the town. We want the High Street to work 18 hours a day instead of eight. The town centre is dead at night. It is off putting. People go to Prestwick for the buzz.” Councillor McGinley said: “Retail is dead. The town centre needs to be re-invigorated.” It is hoped the empty former bridal shop at the Town Hall could house a new museum. Councillor Campbell said: “We have some fantastic artefacts hidden away. Let’s get them out in the open.” All ideas have yet to undergo public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnMuseumsSouth Ayrshire CouncilPrestwickAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"prestwick airport could used free","story":"NewsPrestwick Airport could be used as free parking base for ScotRail passengers on Ayr to Glasgow Central lineGovernment officials have pledged to examine the possibility of using the airport - which they own - for free parking relief to help ease the pain of commuters.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:08, 6 SEP 2018NewsPrestwick Airport could be used for free parking \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrestwick Airport could be used as an unlikely saviour in the ongoing crisis at Ayr Railway Station. Government bosses are examining a plan to utilise the flight hub - which they own - for free parking. A number of services on the Ayr to Glasgow Central line will start and terminate at Prestwick Town from next Monday. But with concerns over a lack of parking in the town, transport chiefs have begun scrambling for other options. Ayr MSP, John Scott, led calls for the move to be considered during First Minister\u0027s Questions today in Holyrood. After raising the issue with Nicola Sturgeon, he told the Ayrshire Post: This is now a crisis situation and we should be looking at all available options. Parking in Prestwick is at a premium as it is, so if the airport can provide free spaces until this situation is resolved, it is something we should look at. Responding to Mr Scott\u0027s idea in parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: It strikes me as a very good suggestion and I can\u0027t think of any immediate objection anyone would have. We know the pressure this is putting on commuters. The First Minister has pledged to explore the option with her officials. Four carriage services will continue to operate between Ayr and Glasgow, but six carriage trains will be halted at Prestwick as part of ScotRail\u0027s plan to combat overcrowding on the line. It comes as crisis engulfs Ayr station with the crumbling overhead hotel, owned by a private Malaysian businessman, subject to a large exclusion zone.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnNicola SturgeonPrestwick AirportScotrailGlasgowAyrTransportAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"stagecoach accused turning ayr street","story":"NewsStagecoach accused of turning Ayr street into \u0027deathtrap\u0027 as double deckers thunder down back roadNeighbours say double decker buses accessing the Waggon Road depot in Ayr are thundering along quiet Green Street at all times of the day and night after a route change.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson13:59, 7 SEP 2018NewsResidents protest outside the bus garage \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFurious residents claim a bus giant has turned their back street into a deathtrap.

It\u0026rsquos subjective.\n\u0026ldquoThe officers and the consultees have expressed reservations, even though they might not have objected.\n\u0026ldquoI think when you join together all these different aspects, of the reservoir, of the William Ogilvie cairn, the cumulative and residential impacts, in my view that makes this application unacceptable.\nA report put to the committee found that 75 comments had been submitted to Scottish Borders Council regarding the project, and all but one of those were objections.\nThe council also received objections from six community councils that would be within sight of the wind farm, and Hawick councillors David Paterson and Watson McAteer also voiced their objections.\nThe latter wrote to his fellow councillors, imploring them to reject the wind farm: \u0026ldquoThis application is a test and should this authority grant the application it is in danger of sending a signal to all developers that rejection is simply a temporary set back and that after some fine tuning reapplication is likely to be successful.\n\u0026ldquoThis approach is debilitating for fragile communities who are being worn down by commercial enterprises that bring financial muscle to a process destined to create over proliferation, landscape desecration and wind turbine blight to a naturally beautiful area of the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoMembers, those I represent can see no valid reason why the previous rejection is not equally valid today and it is your responsibility to ensure that this community is listened to.\n\u0026ldquoIt is quite ridiculous that those who live and nurture this area are once again being called to fight to protect a precious environment, that includes a perilous roads network, from a profit centred business who have no interest in the effect their development will have on such a historic rural community.\nNot all councillors opposed the development, however, with East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing proposing a motion to support officer\u0026rsquos recommendations and approve the application, which Tweeddale East councillor Eric Small seconded.\nCouncillor Laing said the revised plans were a big improvement on the 2012 application: \u0026ldquoI think there has been a significant change to what they have proposed.\n\u0026ldquoI do have my concerns, particularly around the impact on nearby properties, but on balance I am supportive of the officer\u0026rsquos recommendations. There are lots of advantages to this.\nDespite councillor Laing and councillor Small\u0026rsquos support for the bid, the remaining five members of the committee voted to reject the proposals.\nSpeaking after the meeting, ABO Wind\u0026rsquos head of development, Clark Crosbie, said: \u0026ldquoWe are extremely disappointed by the decision of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee.\n\u0026ldquoWe have worked very closely and collaboratively with a wide range of stakeholders over the past few years to develop this project and we believe very strongly that it complied

councillors voted to allow its demolition.\nSt Aidan\u0026rsquos Church, in Gala Park, is set to face the wrecking ball after the owners, Cumbria-based Book Development, concluded that renovating the B-listed Gothic church would be uneconomical.\nAt a meeting of Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday, principal planning officer Barry Fotheringham said demolition was the only economically viable option left.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoThe building is not physically incapable of repair, therefore the overriding principle that needs to be satisfied is one of economic viability.\n\u0026ldquoThis application is supported by feasibility reports and valuations which estimate the building is beyond the point of economic repair.\n\u0026ldquoVarious options have been explored, including the conversion of the church into residential properties, though this would incur a loss of \u0026pound700,000, based on 2018 costs.\n\u0026ldquoAn alternative scheme for a development which would retain the front facade of the church and the spire was also evaluated, and this would potentially result in a loss of around \u0026pound1m.\n\u0026ldquoThe applicant provided subsequent figures that would need to be invested in order to make a profit. \u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoThese assessments conclude that in order to make a reasonable profit, 29 units would be required on site, with 24 units behind the facade and five on the site behind the church.\n\u0026ldquoIt is accepted that not all options have been explored, but it is reasonable to assume that the applicant has demonstrated that a substantial and likely inappropriate development would be required to make the scheme viable.\n\u0026ldquoI am satisfied that the viability argument has been met.\nSpeaking in favour of allowing the demolition, East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: \u0026ldquoI just think this is really, really sad to lose this fabulous building. It depresses me, but I can\u0026rsquot see any other option but to approve this as pretty much all options have been reasonably explored, so it\u0026rsquos with a heavy heart that I vote with the officer\u0026rsquos recommendation.\nGalashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison also supported the recommendation to allow the demolition but said he would be sad to see it go, adding: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a huge emotional issue in terms of buildings and things which are of historic significance.\n\u0026ldquoI worry about the future of built environments.

Before the official opening, our reporter Hilary Scott met up with Susan Meikle and Hazel Millen, owners of the Allotment, who stepped in to save the day following the closure of the previous Post Office on the High Street.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot ever their dream to be postal mistresses. Susan and Hazel were content running their successful store, which has been selling fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, wholefoods, jams and chutney since 2011.\nThey had always been open to suggestions from residents on new products and ideas \u0026ndash creating a monthly cheese tasting evening, and a popular home delivery service.\nWhen news hit the town of the Post Office closure in February last year, the community fought a hard campaign to see its full-time service return.\nThe impact of the closure was felt by the Allotment and other High Street businesses. Susan explained: \u0026ldquoWhen it closed, a lot of people who previously used the Post Office started going out of the town and naturally doing their shopping elsewhere. It hit Innerleithen hard.\nThe pair had previously laughed off any suggestions by locals that they could house the Post Office within their store.\nBut one evening in late December, something moved Susan to click a link online to find out more information \u0026ndash and from this very moment, the revival of the Post Office began.\nNo-one had officially approached them to take on the Post Office, so when asked what moved them to send the application, Susan and Hazel looked at one another and mused: \u0026ldquoYou could call it insanity!\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot easily signed, sealed and delivered. There were many loop holes to jump through, including applications, interviews and trips to Glasgow for training, before they could start running Innerleithen\u0026rsquos new service from their premises.\nAnd although Susan and Hazel say they will not financially benefit by taking on this new responsibility, they feel the gain is retaining a vital service for the people of Innerleithen.\nVariety is the spice of life, and for the Allotment owners and their two hardworking members of staff Leanne and Susan, they\u0026rsquoll be juggling more than apples and pears on occasions. \u0026ldquoI hope people give us a chance. It is going to be a challenge running the Post Office and serving our valued customers, added Susan. \u0026ldquoThere are going to be times that there will be a queue and we would appreciate people\u0026rsquos patience. We are new to this.

increase in funded early learning and childcare from 600 to 1140 hours.\nBy 2020 the additional hours should be available across the whole Borders.\nEducation bosses at Scottish Borders Council believe Langlee Nursery is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a significant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be significantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see if there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by the inspectors.\nBut the inspectors also found problems with the turnover of staff and the need for bank workers to fill in.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"There were acknowledged challenges in the staff team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite significantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the children\u0027s needs could be met and this was being addressed.\"\nWhile previous inspections of Langlee Nursery by the Care Inspectorate led to gradings of either \u0027very good\u0027 or \u0027good\u0027 the latest inspection found the quality of environment, of staffing, and of management as only \u0027adequate\u0027 with only the level of care and support still deemed \u0027good\u0027.\nA spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: \"The council has already taken significant steps following the care inspectorate visit and has addressed a number of the matters raised, for example improving lunch routines.\n\"SBC takes very seriously any recommendations made during these inspections and regularly monitors progress.\n\"We are confident that the

non-governmental organisations.\nIt is the first time in EU history that the European Parliament has initiated and approved such a motion, which needed a two-thirds majority to pass and was approved by 69.4% of MEPs.\nHungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called the vote \u0026ldquopetty revenge against Hungary for its tough anti-migration policies.\nHe also claimed that the vote involved \u0026ldquomassive fraud since abstentions were not counted into the final tally, which made it easier to reach the needed majority.\nThere were 48 abstentions, so the 448 in favour exceeded the

formerly of Ardmaddy Estate, near Oban.The items, including a dummy shell, gas goggles, badges and medals, a uniform and original airship banners and propellers, were collated, over the course of a year, by Eleanor McKay, bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son Charles.\u0026#8216He said he had \u0026#8216one or two

now.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s one of the best collections from the First World War that we have seen.\u0026#8217There are parts of shot-down airships, a parachute, fragments of a radiator from a zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal life and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to

Cornwall, attended the exhibition\u0026#8217s Campbeltown opening to find out more about the Cornish history, and found it \u0026#8216fascinating\u0026#8217.During her opening speech, Eleanor said: \u0026#8216I think this is an area of World War One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think

Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a different pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang returned, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924. In 1925 a christian name is inscribed for the first time, when, Bella Strang, taking her third win, was partnered by  Mr C. MacTaggart.Mrs W. McKersie and Mr C. McTaggart won in 1926 and Miss S.

Consequently, it has not been possible to derive much pathological information from these cases, which is a pain, as this is information we need to identify possible causes of death.\u0026#8216Cuvier’s beaked whales  are native to both British and Irish waters where they occur in deep waters, typically greater than 50 km offshore.

Loud noise can damage the sensitive hair cells in the ear, rendering the animal functionally deaf, or cause gas bubbles to form in the tissues leading to the equivalent of the bends.\u0026#8216Unfortunately, many of the pathological indicators left by excessive exposure to underwater noise are rapidly lost after death, so in most of these cases we won’t have much to go on based on examination of the carcases alone.\u0026#8216The more cases we find, the more chance we have of being able to triangulate a possible origin for these deaths.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"charity putting match on sunday","story":"It will be a fun day for all the family, with ladies, gents and junior prizes, teas, coffees and baking, and there will be a bouncy castle to keep the kids entertained.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.

Duo Gymnastics, based at the Aubigny Sports Centre, Haddington, is keen to buy a new vaulting table, which costs about \u0026pound1,000.  Jane said: \u0026ldquoWhat I have been really impressed with is the way the club and coaches have adapted to him.  \u0026ldquoThere is mainstream gymnastics but they have adapted lessons for his needs.  \u0026ldquoIt has made him not feel different and he still feels part of the club \u0026ndash he really enjoys it.  \u0026ldquoCameron\u0026rsquos disability comes under Global Development Delay.  \u0026ldquoHe has a real difficulty with comprehension and understanding what is being asked of him, following instructions.  \u0026ldquoHe is also very sensitive to noise and sudden loud noises.  \u0026ldquoThat is what they have managed to do really well, break it down into small parts for him.  \u0026ldquoThrough time, it becomes a routine and he understands what is being asked of him.  Jane, who lives near Gifford, has been a keen swimmer for a number of years and represented Scotland in the 1994 Commonwealth Games, in Canada.  However, after a break from swimming she returned to the pool at the beginning of the year before swapping the pool for the sea earlier this summer.  She said: \u0026ldquoI kept swimming as a hobby and to keep fit.  \u0026ldquoI have always swam but it has always been indoor swimming.  \u0026ldquoI started looking about and had always had an interest in open-water swimming but never did it.  \u0026ldquoI came across the Firth of Forth swim and that quite appeals to me and thought I would give it a go.  The mum-of-two signed up in March for the swim, which sees swimmers head off from Hawes Pier and swim alongside the Forth Bridge towards North Queensferry.  Swimmers set off at 2.10pm and have an hour to complete the 1.4-mile swim.  In preparation for the fundraiser on September 22, Jane has taken to the waters off Dumfries and Galloway\u0026rsquos coast and has also linked up with the Bass Rock Swimmers, who are based in North Berwick.  Despite being an accomplished swimmer, Jane said there were still challenges.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe currents are certainly a big factor.  \u0026ldquoIt is just your awareness and you can go off track very easily and just that anticipation of what is below you and what you are swimming over.  \u0026ldquoI have enjoyed the challenge and it has certainly put me out of my comfort zone.  \u0026ldquoI have really enjoyed it and met some really lovely people.  \u0026ldquoMy thanks go to my husband, Garry, and family for support and encourage to take on the challenge and to Duo Gymnastics Club for the support and help they have given Cameron.  Pamela Fletcher, from the gymnastics club, said: \u0026ldquoThanks to Jane undertaking the swim, the club can purchase a new and much needed vaulting table for the gymnastics at Aubigny Sport Centre. Due to local support we have now met our target however donations continue meaning we can hopefully purchase some more equipment. Our club trains twice a week however classes are ran Monday to Friday through enjoyleisure so the equipment is well used by over 200 local gymnasts.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-councils-conservative-opposition-steps-down-after-health-issues","story":"  Councillor Brian Small, who has held the position since being one of seven Conservative councillors elected in May 2017, stood down for a brief period last year following a severe bout of sepsis before returning to the post.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational significance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as if it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.

The cake was made by food artist and cake sculptor Michelle Wibowo and was featured on Channel 4\u0027s tea-time programme Extreme Cake Makers.  The cake was 3\u00274\" wide, and 8\" high, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.  She then printed the exterior of the shop onto edible paper, placing it onto the skeleton on the building.  For the finer details, Michelle used a sugar paste which she sculpted by hand.  The cake itself was crafted in Hayward\u0027s Heath, West Sussex, and then driven to Brighton, where Tranent-born George works.  \"He wanted to help revive the centre of town, so he\u0027s taken on a derelict building, and he\u0027s totally restoring it,\" said Sharon.  George bought the building on the corner of the High Street in late-2015, and planned to renovate it into a mixture of shops, cafes, and a Post Office - as well as refurbishing The Fraser Centre.  Upon seeing Michelle\u0027s creation, she exclaimed: \"It\u0027s exactly what I wanted. It\u0027s got total wow factor. I think it\u0027s absolutely incredible.

Then I realised it was actually a cake, and to see the level of detail and quality in doing something like that, it\u0027s quite fantastic,\" said George.  \"I could take it home, put it in the building, and people would actually think it\u0027s an architects model.\"  Sharon confirmed: \"George was absolutely blown away by the cake. He didn\u0027t want to cut it and was desperately trying to find a way to get it back to Scotland. We pointed out it wasn\u0027t possible because we wanted to eat it.  \"Michelle totally delivered on the cake, so she\u0027s probably the first person in George\u0027s life that has actually managed to do something to surprise him.\"  The show is available on Channel 4\u0027s streaming service All 4.

Some members of the European People\u0026rsquos Party bloc \u0026mdash which Hungarian PM Viktor Orban\u0026rsquos Fidesz movement belongs to \u0026mdash voted against their ally in Budapest.  Mr Orban has for years faced international condemnation over Hungary\u0026rsquos electoral system, media freedoms, independence of the judiciary, mistreatment of asylum seekers and refugees, and limits on the functioning of non-governmental organisations.  It is the first time in EU history that the European Parliament has initiated and approved such a motion, which needed a two-thirds majority to pass and was approved by 69.4% of MEPs.  Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called the vote \u0026ldquopetty revenge against Hungary for its tough anti-migration policies.  He also claimed that the vote involved \u0026ldquomassive fraud since abstentions were not counted into the final tally, which made it easier to reach the needed majority.  There were 48 abstentions, so the 448 in favour exceeded the two-thirds needed only because it was based on 645 votes. If the abstentions were counted into the final tally, there would have been a total 693 votes, so the 448 in favour would not have reached two-thirds.  Mr Szijjarto said Hungary was considering legal options to appeal against the result because of the way the vote was tallied.  But Judith Sargentini, who presented the report prepared by the European Parliament\u0026rsquos Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, welcomed the outcome.  \u0026ldquoViktor Orban\u0026rsquos government has been leading the charge against European values by silencing independent media, replacing critical judges, and putting academia on a leash, Ms Sargentini said. \u0026ldquoThe Hungarian people deserve better. They deserve freedom of speech, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice and equality, all of which are enshrined in the European treaties.  \u0026ldquoThis is a historic result for Hungarian citizens and for European citizens everywhere, that the European Parliament has voted by a large majority to stand up for the values we all hold dear, Ms Sargentini said.  EPP leader Mandred Weber, who earlier was supportive of Mr Orban and is seeking to become the European Commission president next year, said he had voted for triggering Article 7.  \u0026ldquoI have always been in favour of building bridges and I want to continue to do so, but yesterday  I didn\u0026rsquot see any readiness from the Hungarian PM to make a move towards his EU partners and address our concerns, Mr Manfred tweeted."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8674126.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"why-were-mps-wearing-wheat-on-their-lapels-at-pmqs","story":"  The Prime Minister raised eyebrows during last year\u0026rsquos general election campaign when she told how her most mischievous exploit growing up had been to \u0026ldquorun through fields of the crop.

It is important you put this behind you.\"  McIntosh was driving a coach full of Celtic fans which crashed into a car in a road rage incident on the A9. He then parked and got out to punch Mr Wall, from Uphall, in the face.  Mr Wall told the court: \"My wife Alexa was asleep. The bus sped up as I was braking. The chevrons were coming up and the lanes were merging.  \"The bus was driving right behind me. I saw him gesticulating at me. I thought it was some sort of road rage about something.  \"He was hooting his horn and flashing his lights and my wife woke up. I thought I should slow down in case anything happened.  \"I was frightened. My wife was frightened.\"  He said the bus pulled out into the oncoming carriageway to overtake but cars appeared travelling towards them and McIntosh swerved the football coach back in.  \"The bus pulled over and hit the rear of my car. I was trying to keep the car straight on the road. The car bounced. I felt it shudder.  \"It was quite clear we had been hit at about 50 miles per hour. My hands were shaking,\" Mr Wall said.  He pulled into a layby and was followed in by the bus full of Celtic fans returning from their match against Ross County in Dingwall.  As the supporters got out and urinated, McIntosh stormed past Mrs Wall and punched her husband in the face and knocked off his glasses.  Mr Wall said: \"I looked up to see the bus driver standing over me. There was a look of anger and the fist came down like a hammer. I saw his raised fist above me and he banged it down on my temple.  \"I hammered backwards into the car. I saw a white light.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"face-to-face-with-philip-long-the-director-of-the-new-va-dundee-on-building-the-citys-future","story":"  And what an institution. The V\u0026ampA Dundee, as well as being a show-stopping piece of architecture courtesy of the Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, is also a keynote building in the future of the city in which it is based, part of Dundee\u0026rsquos long-term plans for the waterfront .  As a result, it\u0026rsquos difficult to imagine a building in Scotland that will open with more hype, hope and razzmatazz.  \u0026ldquoThe opening of the V\u0026ampA Dundee is a big moment, agrees Long. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a big moment for the institution, but it\u0026rsquos a big moment in the life of Dundee. And I get a sense that there\u0026rsquos excitement about the project much further afield than that. So, we want to make sure that it\u0026rsquos celebrated in a pretty spectacular way.  Over and above the celebrations that will accompany the opening , the museum is also tasked with creating an economic uplift for the city, in effect Dundee\u0026rsquos very own \u0026ldquoBilbao effect. No small task in a city that has been hit in recent decades by all the typical problems blighting post-industrial cities.  When we speak the opening is still a few weeks away. Long is sitting in a Portakabin across from the museum\u0026rsquos staff entrance, discussing the past, present and future of this project. When he first came to Dundee in 2011 the city\u0026rsquos waterfront had a long way to go. Where we are sitting, he points out, was the site of the city\u0026rsquos brutalist swimming pool. He used to go himself and be \u0026ldquohorrified and exhilarated by the fumes, he says.  All change. Across the way the museum remains sealed off from prying eyes but the fit-out is complete, the installation of the exhibitions and displays very advanced and the restaurant and caf\u0026eacute ready to go. It\u0026rsquos a Thursday in mid-August. \u0026ldquoOn Monday we have all our visitor assistants starting. That is exciting, says Long.  \u0026ldquoAbout two years we sat down as a team and said what needs to be achieved by the opening day and worked back from that to see exactly what needed to happen in relation to everything else that needed to be done and who needed to do it. And we are on track with that plan.  As you would expect, Long is an articulate spokesman for his museum. Married with two boys, he\u0026rsquos a young-looking 52, who\u0026rsquos been working on this project since 2011. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom a little greyer than I was seven years ago, he says. \u0026ldquoI need a haircut. But I\u0026rsquove been busy.  Well, indeed. The construction of the museum has been a huge financial and technical challenge. Kengo Kuma\u0026rsquos original plans had to be reined in when the tenders for the building came in much higher than expected almost double the original \u0026pound45m. And though more money was found for its construction  it still proved a complex and testing build.  Not that Long was ever in any doubt that it would be completed. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos been developed in quite a small city, comparatively, in difficult years of political complexity and economic uncertainty. And I think the prospect of a new V\u0026ampA here was such an exciting prospect that I never thought it wasn\u0026rsquot going to happen.  Now it is on his shoulders to make it a success, of course. Is he ready for the challenge? The size of it is certainly clear to him.  \u0026ldquoPreviously, I was a curator at the National Galleries of Scotland with a responsibility for managing elements of that. But I think there is not much that can prepare anybody for the scale of this project, he admits  But that, adds Long, is also the thrill of it. \u0026ldquoTo have the responsibility to develop a new design institution in Scotland that will take very seriously its role to help people understand why design is important, that is going to look at the amazing design creativity of this country, that can bring international exhibitions to Scotland in that wonderful building, and be part of the V\u0026ampA family, then that is an amazing prospect.  The question might be what does that all entail? Or, to put it more bluntly, what does a director do? He breaks his answer into pre and post opening. \u0026ldquoThe responsibility of the director during the development phase is to develop a sense of ambition and vision for the project. What is it? What is it going to be?  And, having done so, he adds, get that vision across to the people working on the building, its stakeholders and the general public.  His job will now change, Long says. \u0026ldquoThe role will be to make sure that it does fulfil those ambitions and its intention to be an institution that helps make people understand why design is important in all our lives is fulfilled, that it creates opportunities to get more people involved, and that it makes a contribution not just to Dundee but to the country more widely.  What he wants is a building that is welcoming to everyone in Dundee. \u0026ldquoMuseums can be intimidating places or seen as places for an elite. We have developed V\u0026ampA Dundee to challenge that.  In what way? Outreach programmes, talks, forming young people\u0026rsquos groups, he explains. \u0026ldquoWe have engaged with over 100,000 people since 2012 and many of those are here in Dundee.  In a parallel universe Long could have been exhibiting in the museum rather than running it. Or even building the thing.  \u0026ldquoI almost became an architect when I was at school. I had a place to do architecture so maybe doing V\u0026ampA Dundee is fulfilling some of these early ambitions, he says.  Having grown up in Edinburgh\u0026nbspLong actually studied sculpture at art school. \u0026ldquoI trained as an artist, but I very quickly became interested in museums and galleries and how they could make a difference to people.  After studying in England, he returned to Scotland where he worked for the Fine Art Society in Glasgow, before getting a job as a junior curator at the National Galleries of Scotland. He then worked his way up to a senior position.  \u0026ldquoI had a chance to create exhibitions and work with artists and get involved in some major projects, like the development of the former Dean orphanage into the Dean Gallery, now Modern Two. I also looked after the development of Charles Jencks\u0026rsquos Landform and I worked on the development of the Artist Rooms project specifically so it could be shared across the country.  The V\u0026ampA Dundee is of a different order, it must be said. Because there is so much riding on it. But Long reckons it will deliver because the city wants it to. Needs it to, even.  \u0026ldquoWhen I came here what I sensed was there was a real enthusiasm and energy for making a change. But in terms of the physicality of the city there was much to be done on that. The V\u0026ampA Dundee is a complete new development contributing to the economic future of the city.  \u0026ldquoBut what I\u0026rsquove also seen is a sort of change in energy and sense of being able to get things done. Dundee applied to be UK City of Culture. It lost to Hull. It came a very close second, but it didn\u0026rsquot sit back and commiserate. Shortly afterwards it was successful in being awarded the title of Unesco City of Creative Design.  \u0026ldquoWhat I\u0026rsquove seen here in the city is one success leads to a greater ambition. There\u0026rsquos that sense in the city of: \u0026lsquoWe get things done here.\u0026rsquo I think that is really building confidence here.

The decision follows a lengthy process that saw Hampden Park competing with BT Murrayfield to be the home of Scottish football following the Euro 2020 finals.  The Scottish FA will now work with Queen\u0026rsquos Park to complete the agreement, which will see the ownership of Hampden Park transfer to the Scottish FA for a cash price of \u0026pound5 million.  Queen\u0026rsquos Park will adapt Lesser Hampden to become its new registered licensed ground for all its matches.  Ownership of Hampden Park will enable the SFA to control the future of the stadium.  It will open up opportunities to continue to develop the infrastructure and create a national stadium that will inspire the next generation of football fans.  The SFA expressed their gratitude to Lord Willie Haughey, who has pledged half of the total cash commitment .  SFA president Alan McRae said: \u0026ldquoToday\u0026rsquos announcement has been the conclusion of a four-year process to review our national stadium beyond 2020.  \u0026ldquoIt was a hugely difficult decision and I would like to place on record our thanks to Scottish Rugby for their professionalism throughout the process.  \u0026ldquoThey made a truly compelling case to move to Edinburgh and gave us a very difficult decision to make.

It is about the future of football in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoI would also like to thank everyone who has been part of this process and to recognise the enormous generosity of Lord Haughey.  \u0026ldquoFinally, it has also been a hugely challenging time for Queen\u0026rsquos Park, Hampden Park Limited and all of the people who will be directly affected by this decision. We appreciate all their efforts to reach an agreement today and look forward to working with them to shape the future and continue to develop a national stadium that we can all be proud of.  SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell said: \u0026ldquoI would first of all like to offer my thanks to Dominic McKay and his team at Scottish Rugby. They have been impressive throughout the process and I would like to continue to build that relationship. There is a lot we can learn from each other.  \u0026ldquoToday is a big day for Scottish football. Hampden Park has been the spiritual home of Scottish football for over 100 years it has been central to our sport\u0026rsquos identity in this country. But today\u0026rsquos decision is about the future, not the past.  \u0026ldquoOur mission is to inspire a nation to love the game and having a home that we can call our own is an important part of that. It will enable us to drive investment into the game and give us the best chance to improve football in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoWhile we are now committed to Hampden Park we also recognise that it needs to change. We have heard the fans\u0026rsquo views throughout the process and agree with them that we need to improve access, transport links and the overall experience. We are committed to doing that.  \u0026ldquoWith all the commitments that have been made to the Scottish FA and Hampden Park Limited throughout this process, taking ownership of the Hampden Park site will create the potential to transform the home of Scottish football for the benefit of Scottish football fans. Ownership really will change the game.

This compares to 32% in England.  The \u0027State of Maternity Services\u0027 report found that 51% of pregnant women in Scotland in 2017 were obese or overweight, the first time the proportion has exceeded 50%.  This puts them at greater risk of gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, and premature birth.  Meanwhile, a total of 158 babies were born to women aged over 45 last year - the highest number to date, and up from 29 in 2000. The number of births to women aged 40 to 44 has increased 68% over the same period.

At the same time, the vacancy rate for midwives has increased from 1.3% in September 2013 to 5% in March 2018 - equivalent to 127 empty posts.  Recruitment problems are toughest in Grampian, Highland and the Western Isles.  Looming retirements were also highlighted, particularly in the context of the redesign of Scotland\u0027s maternity services following the Best Start review which will see mothers allocated a named midwife for all their pregnancy, labour and postnatal care.  It could see a shift away from fixed shifts to an \u0027on-call\u0027 model that would see midwives responding whenever a mother on their caseload went into labour.  The report states: \"This model of care has strong evidence of benefits for women, families and, potentially, for midwives.  \"However, the introduction of such a significantly different way of working also brings with it uncertainties for the future workforce.  \"Some older midwives may choose to retire rather than take on a new way of working and it is also not yet clear whether the new model of care will require more midwives.  \"The impact of the implementation of the Best Start review recommendations on the workforce will start to be seen over the next one to two years.\"  Read more: Only two in 300 mothers in Scotland having a home birth  However, the report praised the Scottish Government for maintaining bursaries and free tuition for student midwives at a time whether they have been axed in England and fees imposed for the first time.

Mary Ross-Davie, RCM director for Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThere are some great things happening in our maternity services in Scotland, not least the very ambitious Best Start maternity programme.  \"The Scottish Government has also delivered real increases in the number of student midwives, which we welcome.  \u0026ldquoHowever, pressures on our midwives are increasing \u0026ndash the care needs of the women in our care are rising, while the number of unfilled midwifery posts is also rising.

Mr Cortes has written to the Train Operating Companies, including ScotRail, and to Network Rail seeking assurances they will not support Mr Grayling\u0027s move to impose pay rises which fell below the normal Retail Price Index, which, he argued, would be an effective pay cut.  Noting how morale among overworked rail staff was low, the union chief said they were furious with the Secretary of State\u0026rsquos plan.  \u0026ldquoUnless he backs off or, better still, is booted out, industrial action including strikes this coming winter loom large, declared Mr Cortes.

Mr McDonnell, whose keynote speech to Congress pledged to give workers in the gig economy the same rights as other employees, including sick pay and parental leave, said he recognised there was \u0026ldquoreal anger among rail workers.  Asked if industrial action was something he would support, the Shadow Chancellor replied: \u0026ldquoWe will see what industrial action takes place.

The architect added: \"It is also fitting that the restored Oak Room by Charles Rennie Mackintosh is at the heart of this building as I have greatly admired his designs since I was a student.  \"In the Oak Room, people will feel his sensibility and respect for nature, and hopefully connect it with our design for V\u0026ampA Dundee.  \"I hope the museum can change the city and become its centre of gravity.\"  V\u0026ampA Dundee\u0026rsquos construction and fit-out took three and a half years to complete and is a key part of the \u0026pound1 billion transformation of the Dundee waterfront.

Notably, Mackintosh\u0027s Oak Room has been restored, conserved and reconstructed through a partnership between V\u0026ampA Dundee, Glasgow Museums and Dundee City Council.    It has not been seen by the public for more than 50 years.  The first exhibition - Ocean Liners: Speed and Style - has been organised by the V\u0026ampA and the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts.  Philip Long, director of V\u0026ampA Dundee, said: \u0026ldquoThe opening of V\u0026ampA Dundee is a historic occasion for Dundee, for the V\u0026ampA, and for the very many people who played a vital part and supported its realisation. This is a very proud moment for all involved.  \"V\u0026ampA Dundee\u0026rsquos aspiration is to enrich lives, helping people to enjoy, be inspired by and find new opportunities through understanding the designed world.  \"After years of planning, we are thrilled at being able to celebrate the realisation of the first V\u0026ampA museum in the world outside London.\"  The cost of the building was paid for by the Scottish Government, the National Lottery through the Heritage Lottery Fund and Creative Scotland, Dundee City Council, the UK Government, Scottish Enterprise, University of Dundee, Abertay University and a private fundraising campaign, which is now complete.  The Scottish Government is heavily invested in the museum: it provided \u0026pound38m towards the museum, plus \u0026pound361,000 in 2018-19 to support its first year of activity.  The UK Government also gave \u0026pound5m.

The police and Care Inspectorate have been informed, and an investigation into claims linked to the teacher\u0026rsquos alleged behaviour is now underway.  Details of the precise nature of the complaint have not yet been confirmed, and investigations into the allegations are believed to be at an early stage.  However headteacher Dr Graham Hawley has said they relate to behaviour which is not tolerated at the school.  Loretto School is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos leading fee-paying schools, where parents pay up to \u0026pound33,600 a year to board senior pupils.  It regularly receives top ratings and is particularly renowned for its drama, music, art and sport.  Headmaster, Dr Graham Hawley said: \u0026ldquoAs Headmaster and as a parent, I am deeply disturbed by these allegations and I take them very seriously.  \u0026ldquoThe alleged behaviour is unacceptable and has no place in our community. It is everything that we are not.  \u0026ldquoAs soon as the allegations were brought to us we took action: we alerted the police, we alerted the Care Inspectorate, we instigated an internal investigation, we suspended the member of staff in question.  \u0026ldquoThe school has undertaken extensive work to ensure it is as safe an environment as it is possible for a school to be. We have built a culture in which pupils can feel empowered to come forward, to seek and find the support they need in situations like this.  Loretto School is one of the country\u0026rsquos top private schools, with parents paying up to \u0026pound33,600 a year to board senior children at its 85 acre leafy campus, which features its own golf academy. Around 400 boys and girls attend Loretto Senior School, with around 70 per cent opting to board.  A further 200 attend the Junior School, while the nursery caters for children from birth to five years old.  Former pupils at the school, which was founded in 1827, include broadcaster Andrew Marr, former Chancellors of the Exchequer Norman Lamont and Alistair Darling and motor racing legend Jim Clarke. Movie director Don Boyd, whose films have included Scum, Look Back in Anger and The Great Rock \u0026lsquon\u0026rsquo Roll Swindle, is also a former pupil at the school.  Last year\u0026rsquos Tatler Schools Guide placed Loretto School in the top seven per cent nationally and singled out the \u0026ldquospectacular dance and drama studio for particular praise.  A spokesperson for the Care Inspectorate confirmed a probe is underway. He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been notified by the Loretto School of an allegation involving a member of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe are working closely with the school. Anyone with a concern about a care service can contact us on 0345 600 9527.  Dr Hawley added: \u0026ldquoGiven the sensitivities of this situation, the investigation, and involvement of the authorities, I am limited in what more I can say however, I am committed to ensuring that Loretto is a school where no behaviour of this alleged kind will ever be tolerated."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-faces-fresh-tory-bid-to-outs-her-as-prime-minister","story":"  But it would appear Theresa May\u0027s biggest challenge could be coming from her own side.  It has emerged her premiership is facing fresh pressure after a group of senior Tory MPs spent nearly an hour war-gaming how to oust her at a private meeting.  Around 50 MPs discussed ways and means of getting rid of her at a gathering of the European Research Group .  A number of MPs told how they had already submitted letters of no confidence to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee, and others discussed plans to follow suit.  If 48 letters are handed over a vote of no confidence would be triggered.  At a dinner with the PM\u0027s senior aides, meanwhile, MPs raised \"leadership issues\".  Backbenchers told the Prime Minister\u0027s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, his boss must \"chuck Chequers\" over a dinner at No 10.  The flurry of activity came after former foreign secretary Boris Johnson launched a fresh attack on the PM\u0027s Brexit plan, claiming it would be \"substantially worse than the status quo\" for British businesses.  Speaking after the No 10 dinner, Tory MP Andrew Bridgen did not deny suggestions the PM would face a coup.  He told ITV News: \"I\u0027ve been told that she will get a full appraisal of comments that were made over the dinner.\"  Asked if there would be a coup, he replied: \"I think we will just have to wait and see.  \"I hope that the Prime Minister will take on board what she\u0027s heard and chuck Chequers.\"  Conservative Brexiteer John Baron told ITV: \"We were discussing leadership issues.\"  Downing Street yesterday reiterated that Chequers was \"the only serious, credible and negotiable plan which is on the table which both delivers on the will of the British people and which prevents the imposition of a hard border in Northern Ireland\".  Mr Johnson spoke at an Economists for Free Trade  event on Tuesday attended by a battalion of Tory Brexit big-hitters including Jacob-Rees Mogg, former Brexit secretary David Davis and his ex-deputy Steve Baker, former party leader Iain Duncan Smith and ex-Defra Secretary Owen Paterson.  The ex-minister declined to answer questions from journalists but used a Q\u0026ampA session at the end of the report launch to make a statement himself.  He said leaving the EU while continuing to accept the single market legislation would expose businesses to rules that may go against their interests.  \"That seems to me to be a particular economic risk in Chequers and makes it substantially worse than the status quo,\" he said.  The ERG will be unveiling its own alternative plan for tackling the Irish border issue on Wednesday.  The group has faced criticism from opponents who say it has attacked the Government\u0027s plans without coming up with one of its own on one of the main sticking points in discussions between Brussels and the Government."},{"url":null,"title":"major-advice-centre-brings-in-four-day-week-for-staff","story":"  Advice Direct Scotland has ensured all 68 members of staff in Glasgow and Stornoway will work fewer hours while receiving the same wages as before.  The moves comes as Frances O\u0026rsquoGrady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress , calls for a four-day week which would allow workers to share in the wealth generated by technological advances.  Advice Direct Scotland is a charity that provides free advice and information on a range of subjects including benefits, debt, money worries and consumer issues.  It delivers a full citizens advice service over the phone and online, through live chat, email and social media.  This week, the TUC is calling for people to work fewer hours, with around 1.4 million people thought to be working seven days every week.  David Rutherford, quality and compliance manager at Advice Direct Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a major first step by a large and growing organisation to introduce a four-day working week, and everyone is very confident it will increase productivity and reduce absenteeism.  \u0026ldquoAdvice Direct Scotland is a modern consumer-facing employer, and we want all workers to be positive about their job and look forward to coming to work.  \u0026ldquoToo many people across Scotland and the UK are working excessively long hours, and that\u0026rsquos not good for society.  \u0026ldquoThe four-day working week has given staff more time to do what they love. I used my extra day off to take my six-month-old son swimming and go to one of his dentist appointments for the first time. Everyone in the office is sharing stories about what they did on their day off. It\u0026rsquos created a really positive atmosphere, and everyone loves the better work-life balance.  Research by the TUC found that four out of five employees want to cut their working hours without losing any pay as new technology makes work more efficient.  The TUC believes moves should be put in place to try to cut the working week to four days over the course of this century.  In her to the TUC congress this week, Ms O\u0026rsquoGrady accused employers of making staff work unpredictable or unsocial hours because of an \u0026ldquoalways on culture.  The general secretary said: \u0026ldquoBosses and shareholders must not be allowed to hoover up all the gains from new technology for themselves.  \u0026ldquoWorking people deserve their fair share \u0026ndash and that means using the gains from new technology to raise pay and allow more time with their families."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-unfit-to-govern-and-incapable-of-leadership-blasts-snps-ian-blackford","story":"  Speaking at PMQs, Mr Blackford set out how the last 10 years had been the worst decade for wage growth for 200 years, laying the blame on Tory austerity policies.

And Ms Freeman said the chief medical officer has continued to keep the issueunder review and is listening to the women who have been affected of this.  She said: \"I have today asked the chief medical officer to instruct health boards to immediately halt the use of transvaginal mesh altogether in cases of both pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence, pending the implementation of a new restricted use protocol, that will ensure procedures are only carried out only in the most exceptional circumstances.\"  Holyrood\u0026rsquos public petitions committee has called for the use of mesh implants to stop, citing \u0026ldquoserious concerns over an independent review into their use.

Around 70 representatives from businesses in the east of Aberdeenshire attended the agri-tourism event at Fyvie Castle, where delegates had the opportunity to hear from speakers about current industry trends and network with tourism businesses locally.                                                    In Aberdeenshire, 65% of the population is based rurally – which highlights the wealth of opportunity that exists to continue to build, expand and be entrepreneurial with rural links, to continue to attract visitors to our part of Scotland. Nationally, the value of domestic visitor spend in rural areas amounts to £633 million and equates to 2.6 million domestic trips.                                                    Chris Greenwood, VisitScotland’s Senior Tourism Insights Manager, spoke to delegates about agricultural and rural tourism insights and the impacts and benefits for Aberdeenshire and Chris Foy, Chief Executive at VisitAberdeenshire presented the new destination strategy for Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, detailing how they hope to grow visitor spend to £1 billion per year by 2023.        A new plan to develop food and drink tourism in Scotland – aiming to deliver an additional £1 billion to Scotland’s economy by 2030 – was recently launched by Nicola Sturgeon. At the event, Peter Cook, Director of Food, Drink and Agriculture at Opportunity North East, updated those attending about Opportunity North East’s work within that sector.Jo Robinson, VisitScotland Regional Director, said: “I am delighted that representatives from so many businesses in East Aberdeenshire attended this event, which hopefully gave them real food for thought on the subject of rural tourism.“This region has tremendous assets and strengths that offer visitors a range of great experiences – from food and drink to farm shops, coasts to castles and woods to wigwams. VisitScotland helps to promote these strengths to a global audience.“With 21% of domestic visitor trips being to rural areas and 22% of domestic visitor spend being in rural areas, capitalising on these visitors is so important. Hopefully events like this can help rural businesses to make the most of these opportunities.”                                                                                                        Gillian Martin, Aberdeenshire East MSP, said: “We have one of the most diverse regions in Scotland with an abundance of historical and cultural significance and interest.

He underwent surgery at 18 months old and then went for regular checkups to monitor how his kidneys were functioning.  At a routine appointment in October 2014, doctors delivered the news that his kidneys were failing and Nick started dialysis shortly after.He said: “I’d lived with the condition all my life so hearing that I’d need treatment was a shock. “The doctor told me I’d be lucky to make it to Christmas without being on dialysis but I held on until February 2015.                                                                                                        “By the time I went on dialysis, my kidney function had dropped to eight per cent. I thought I was okay but looking back I was constantly tired and agitated. Things were a bit of a struggle.”Nick was determined the dialysis would not take over his life and kept working throughout.He said: “I was team leader at that time for an oil company – in charge of the onshore group.“I was determined to keep on working and have as normal a life as possible but it meant doing dialysis every night after work.“I’d leave home at 7am and not get back until 10pm or 10.30pm every day                                                                                                         “Dialysis was hard. I felt like my life had been put on hold but I knew the treatment was the only thing keeping me alive. “Some days were better than others the staff at the hospital got me through some difficult times.”Despite that, Nick decided to propose to Philippa and booked the wedding at the Winter Gardens in the hope she would say yes.“I left flowers by the kettle one night – happily she said yes,” said Nick.“We’d been together for ten years and she saw me through everything.“She had to put up with an awful lot – the mood swings, not going out because I was too tired all the time – but she still said yes.”The couple got married last August and were on honeymoon when Nick got the call that would transform their lives.He said: “I was really lucky – I was only on the transplant list for two and a half years.“But I didn’t get my hopes up too much until I was taken down to theatre and knew it was going to happen.“I was building myself up for disappointment until that point. It was a really surreal experience.”Happily, the transplant went ahead and Nick woke up to a whole new life.“As soon as I woke up from surgery I instantly felt better,” he said. “Nothing could have prepared me for the difference it made.  “I’d just got married and then I got the gift that I’d waited over two years for.  “To have a life free from dialysis was the best feeling and I felt amazing. I didn’t realise how ill I’d been until I had the transplant and started to feel 100 times better. It was fantastic.”Nick, an electrician by trade, has made the most of his donor’s incredible gift – enjoying life to the full and setting up his own business.He said: “It was something I always wanted to do but would never have been able to achieve on dialysis.“I now have my own electrical business and am working all over Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.“It’s made a massive difference to Philippa and me too – we can go out and enjoy ourselves now. It’s nice to have that freedom it’s a new life basically.”As for his donor’s family, Nick has written a letter thanking them for his gift.He said: “I know nothing about the person who made my transplant possible but I owe them everything. “They saved my life and are truly my hero. I want their family to know I will be eternally grateful for this incredible gift.”Nick is already on the organ donor register and hopes his story will encourage others to sign up.He added: “It’s quite possibly the most important thing anyone can ever do.”To join the NHS Organ Donor Register, visit weneedeverybody.org                "},{"url":null,"title":"scottish tradesmen it s your call to help children","story":"        Protecting children does not just fall to the police, social workers and professionals who work with them.

The NSPCC\u0027s Childline is on call 24 hours a day to help children who need help.\u0027\u0027      \t         Matt Forde, the national head of NSPCC Scotland, said: “We’re not asking people to spy on families. “But when they see something, in their heart of hearts, they know isn’t right, we’re asking them to report it so that those families can get the help they need.                                                                                                        “The online course both informs and educates about the signs of abuse and neglect and what you should do if you have a gut feeling that something is not right.“We’re not trying to turn plumbers or builders into social workers.“But they do spend a lot of time in customers’ homes and it’s not an unlikely scenario that someone in that situation might gain an insight into a child’s life.“People are often unsure whether they should report it. We would ask them to look at it from the child’s point of view – or their own child’s.                                                                                                        “The police and children’s services are not in the business of getting involved, willy-nilly, when they don’t need to.“In the vast majority of cases, children are not removed from their homes but their families do get the help and support they need.“Often, parents have their own pressures and have lost sight of their child’s needs.“They’re overwhelmed with their own difficulties and have a strong instinct against asking for help.“It’s very often a burden that is lifted when they get a chance to talk about something they have been struggling with on their own for far too long.”                                                                                                        On the flip side of that coin are children who are in imminent danger.NSPCC Scotland asks the public to call its helpline – 0808 800 5000 – or the police immediately in the worst case scenarios.Last year in Scotland, the NSPCC’s helpline referred 2012 calls and emails to local agencies such as the police or children’s services.The majority were from people who were concerned a child was being neglected  followed by concerns about physical abuse , emotional abuse  and sexual abuse .Matt said: “There has been increased traffic to our helpline.“People are often unsure whether to report something – they really struggle with it.“By calling the helpline, they can talk through their concerns and decide whether it’s something that needs to be taken forward.“Our advice would be for people to consider if it was their child in that situation – better safe, than sorry.”As the NSPCC relies on donations from the public to deliver its services in Scotland, the It’s Your Call online course does cost £19 for individual tradesmen, with package deals also available for employers.But Matt is hopeful that it will become a success.He said: “It’s very early days for the It’s Your Call training but we are hoping individuals and employers will take it up.“We are not funded by the government – we raise all our own funding – so a fee is involved to cover the cost of delivering the training. “But we hope people will agree it’s a small price to pay to help children who are potentially being abused or neglected.“It’s about helping to give children a voice when they can’t speak out themselves.”NSPCC Scotland prides itself on providing a voice for children but is also keen that young people, of all ages, are able to make their own voices heard too.The charity holds special Speak Out, Stay Safe assemblies at primary schools in every local authority area in Scotland with that aim in mind.Matt added: “We help children understand what abuse is and what to do if they are affected.“We then go back two weeks later to find out what the children made of it and reinforce the message. “Children often come to Childline when they are aged 12 and above, talking about things that have happened to them for years.“So we wanted to deliver a programme for primary schools in the hope that children would start reporting issues earlier.“Teachers have been very positive about the programme as it’s a topic they often struggle with too.” The NSPCC is the leading children’s charity fighting to end child abuse and protect children at risk in the UK and Channel Islands. Voluntary donations make up around 90 per cent of its funding.Childline open 24 hours a dayThe NSPCC’s Childline service has two bases in Scotland, in Aberdeen and Glasgow.In 2017/18, Childline volunteers delivered almost 280,000 counselling sessions to children and young people across the UK on the phone and online. Based on the population of Aberdeenshire, it is estimated that volunteers delivered around 1800 counselling sessions to children living in that area last year alone.Some of them are going through the toughest times of their lives. They face issues such as mental/emotional health, family relationships and bullying. So it’s vital that they have somewhere to turn. Childline – 0800 11 11 and www.childline.org.uk – is there for them 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.On average, a child somewhere in the UK contacts Childline every 25 seconds.NSPCC Scotland’s Speak Out Stay Safe  service, which helps children learn how to recognise abuse, has now been delivered in the majority of our mainstream primary schools.Sadly, in the average primary school class, at least two children have suffered abuse or neglect.Just £4 pays for a child’s call or contact with Childline and £3 pays for the SOSS programme to reach a child. But the NSPCC relies on donations from the public to provide its services across the UK and volunteers to help deliver them.To find out how you can help the charity or to make a donation, visit the website https:www.nspcc.org.uk/what-you-can-do.

September has a high rate of babies being born.\u0026ldquoStaff morale is already at an all-time low. Several experienced midwives are either retiring or leaving because of the added workload and the burden it is causing.Bill Fernie of the pressure group Caithness Health Action Team said he was not surprised that a midwife felt compelled to speak out.He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a terrible situation for the staff to find themselves in. They should be commended for all their efforts.\u0026ldquoTravelling to Raigmore places more than enough strain on the mums and their families so going to Glasgow would have added to that. I can fully understand why someone at Raigmore would want to whistle-blow as it appears to be a pretty fraught situation.An NHS Highland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoDue to the unpredictable nature of maternity activity, cases are assessed on an individual basis and robust risk assessment and escalation plans are in place to ensure safe service provision.\u0026ldquoTo date, since accepting intrapartum transfers from Elgin, there has been no need for any Caithness woman to be diverted from Raigmore Hospital to deliver elsewhere due to staffing levels or capacity, as is being suggested by the midwife whom you interviewed.Wednesday 12 Sep 2018 3:00 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Bower author helping Norn become the norm","story":"COMMON words and phrases used by Caithnessians may be thought of by locals as slang terms \u0026ndash but, by using them, they may have been reviving a dead language.Bower author Elspeth Grace Hall is doing her bit to revive the language of Norn that was once widely spoken in Caithness.Norn was officially declared a \u0026ldquodead language by world heritage body the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization .However, Grace Hall has been bringing about a revival of the region\u0026rsquos native tongue by writing a series of children\u0026rsquos workbooks to teach kids how to read and write in Norn.If Elspeth is successful in helping to increase the numbers of Norn speakers in Caithness, UNESCO could reverse its death declaration.They had once delivered a similar verdict on Kernowek \u0026ndash the native language of south-west English county, Cornwall.But in 2010, UNESCO announced that its former classification of the language as \u0026ldquoextinct was \u0026ldquono longer accurate.Grace Hall said: \u0026ldquoIf you have ever sat \u0026lsquoO a benk\u0026rsquo, fed the \u0026lsquoscorries\u0026rsquo, told your \u0026lsquomannie\u0026rsquo off for being a \u0026lsquoloon\u0026rsquo or simply popped off \u0026lsquotill\u0026rsquo the shops you have been speaking a second language \u0026ndash one that officially doesn\u0026rsquot even exist.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been intrigued by languages and the Caithness dialect is wonderfully rich.\u0026ldquoI started to investigate the etymology of words unique to Caithness and found that they weren\u0026rsquot part of Scots, English or Gaelic, they were in fact Norn. A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classification of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in if Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo if only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked if they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has over 200 translators making their bilingual books available in languages traditional publishes ignore such as English Igbo in Nigeria, German/Tigrinya in Ethiopia and now English/Norn in

Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Wednesday 12 Sep 2018 3:00 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the individual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Wednesday 12 Sep 2018 3:00 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the lengthy cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it.

Without the support of the Youth Achievement Group I would never have had the confidence to apply for such an important opportunity.”Maureen Herdman  said: “We are delighted for Hope as this is a great opportunity for her to further advance her skills and confidence and represent young people on a national stage.

This has made her challenge to find a way to climb the sea stack all the more unique and has presented a series of challenges in the planning stages.She will take on the climb in aid of the Calvert Trust, which supports people with disabilities through outdoor adventure.Asked why she had picked the Old Man of Hoy, Michelle laughed: \u0026#8220Because it\u0026#8217s the biggest sea stack going. I\u0026#8217d had the idea that I wanted to climb a sea stack before I was injured. It hadn\u0026#8217t really crossed my mind that I would ever be able to climb the old man of Hoy because it is notoriously difficult. I thought one day I would get it done but then I fell and I thought it\u0026#8217d never happen.\u0026#8220A friend came to me during rehab and said I needed to start setting myself goals and challenges but all my interests were based around climbing, which I didn\u0026#8217t think I could do anymore. It felt like that was totally ruled out – how can you climb without legs?\u0026#8220But they sent me some links to some really inspirational paraplegics, who were during climbing but in an adaptive way. Ordinarilly, climbing with two legs is like puzzle solving where you pick a route and decide what will work for you and that\u0026#8217s what I used to love.\u0026#8220When climbing in an adaptive way, you don\u0026#8217t get any of that puzzle solving and when people first spoke to me about climbing in that way I thought it wasn\u0026#8217t really the same so I wouldn\u0026#8217t want to do it. For me it was never about getting to the top of something, it was about the journey and figuring stuff out.\u0026#8220Climbing something in an adaptive way uses a pulley system and you haul your weight up. I thought there was no puzzle to that \u0026#8211 how wrong I was. I\u0026#8217ve not even attempted this climb yet and it\u0026#8217s been the biggest puzzle in the world. Creating the equipment has been the biggest challenge and finding people who have the ideas to make the equipment, it\u0026#8217s a never-ending puzzle.\u0026#8221To donate or find out more about Michelle\u0026#8217s challenge visit the website www.routetothesky\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This year the entries will be narrowed down to 15 finalists who will discuss their ideas with the judges at the finals day on November 22.Last year\u0026rsquos top prize went to former Inverness College UHI student Paul Beaulieu , from Milton, Invergordon, who took home a cash prize of \u0026pound1500 and a combined legal and accountancy package worth \u0026pound2000 for an idea that could revolutionise how pipes are fabricated and fitted together.Dr Carol Langston, head of Create, said: \"Often people have a business idea, but they don\u0026rsquot know what to do with it, or who to turn to for help. That\u0026rsquos where Create comes in. We work with people to encourage them to be ambitious, bold and creative in their thinking, with the aim of encouraging innovation.\"Former winner Anna Renouf of Orrin Equestrian, is encouraging new entrants to take part in the competition.Since winning the most innovative business idea and the best engineering and technology award in 2015, she has gone on to win \u0026pound10,000 from Scottish Edge and received a Smart Scotland feasibility grant, which has allowed her to focus on the development of her innovative saddle design.Anna said: \"The University of the Highlands and Islands Business Competition represented the start of my business journey and it really gave me the confidence to take my idea forward and develop it further.\"Even now, I regularly seek advice and guidance from the Create team about the direction of my business.

When the kirk on the shores of Lochbroom was put up for sale by the Church of Scotland back in 2016, it\u0026rsquos future looked uncertain.A determined local fundraising drive saw it eventually taken into community ownership by locals who see it as a key hub in the beautiful, remote area.Celia said: \"We saw how well Donnie Mackenzie\u0026rsquos fundraiser for Clachan did and the huge boost it gave everyone involved. Sara and I thought we would enjoy getting fitter, seeing more of our country, and help Clachan at the same time. Since our local Trust became owners on June 22 we straightaway saw the difference it has made to our community. It has become a community focus right from the start.\"With the doors open more often we know there\u0026rsquos someone there and stop for a chat. For those of us living on the no-through road on the west shore of Loch Broom, we pass Clachan every time we go anywhere so it is ideal.\"\"When Clachan opened during the Lochbroom Sheepdog Trials, the trust displayed some local produce, from handloom weaving, cards, honey, handmade books and paintings, to show the range of economic activity in Lochbroom. That is the tip of the iceberg. There\u0026rsquos only a small population but there\u0026rsquos a huge number of people producing high-quality goods \u0026ndash having their work displayed in a public building helps everybody.\"Sara and I are confident that Clachan will be an asset to the Lochbroom community for many years to come so we are asking for sponsorship. This can be done at the New Broom hub in Ullapool and by emailing me at celiajcharity@me. Thank you.\"Kenneth Macleod, an interim trustee of Clachan Lochbroom Heritage Trust, said: \"I have seen the benefit that grows from rescuing a building, improving it and making it available for wider purposes. Of course Clachan continues for the usual church occasions \u0026ndash we want everyone to know that! \u0026ndash whilst extending its usefulness for other appropriate purposes.\"Wednesday 12 Sep 2018 3:01 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

He lives at Millcraig Road with wife Jennifer, and has been retired for nine years.The couple have a daughter, Lorna, who lives in Glasgow and three granddaughters, Morgan , Kayla  and Nyah .The eldest followed in her grandfather\u0026rsquos musical footsteps and gave him one of his proudest moments when she performed a senior drumming role in the Army Cadets Pipe Band parade last Easter. Mr Angus is a noted drummer and was back behind the drum kit on Saturday just prior to his accolade, entertaining the crowd.The former Dingwall Academy pupil threw himself into his drumming career ahead of a 26-year stint with North of Scotland Water Authority, which became Scottish Water.

Delivering his \u0027State of the Union\u0027 address in Strasbourg on Wednesday morning, the Commission President underlined the EU\u0027s rejection of any plan that breaks up the key components of the single market, which guarantees freedom of movement for goods, services, people and capital.            His comments come as it was revealed that Brexiteers in the Prime Minister\u0027s party had stepped up their campaign to oust Mrs May, holding open discussions about a leadership coup at a meeting on Tuesday night if the government does not abandon the Chequers plan.

EU chief Brexit negotiator fuelled speculation of a new approach to talks when he told a conference earlier this week that a deal with the UK within eight weeks was \"realistic\".However, Mr Juncker\u0027s address has dampened those hopes, with Brussels remaining firm in its defence of the single market.The EU Commission President also struck a tough line on the issue of the Irish border, the major obstacle to finalising the UK\u0027s exit treaty.

The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the life of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4798577.1536746876!/image/image.jpg","title":"hurricane florence residents flee as category 4 storm heads for us coast","story":"        Millions of Americans are preparing for what could be one of the most catastrophic hurricanes to hit the eastern seaboard in decades.                Hurricane Florence’s top winds dipped to 130mph on yesterday, but it remains a Category 4 storm and is expected to approach Category 5 status as it slows and strengthens over warm water off the coast of North and South Carolina.            The centre of the storm is forecast to meander tomorrow, Friday and Saturday over a stretch of coastline saturated by rising seas, inundating several states with rainfall and triggering life-threatening floods.            “Please be prepared, be careful and be SAFE!” US president Donald Trump tweeted.Mandatory evacuations are under way for parts of three east coast states, and the mayor of Washington DC declared a state of emergency as the US capital prepares for heavy rain and flooding.South Carolina’s governor ordered the evacuation of the state’s entire coastline yesterday and predicted that a million people would flee as major roads reverse directions.Virginia’s governor ordered a mandatory evacuation for some residents of low-lying coastal areas, while some coastal counties in North Carolina have done the same.North Carolina governor Roy Cooper said his state is “in the bullseye” and urged people to “get ready now”.            The centre of that bullseye may be Camp Lejeune, a sprawling Marine Corps training base. Forecast predict 20 inches of rain or more falling there, part of a wide stretch of rainfall that could see ten inches or more over much of Virginia and drench the nation’s capital. Some isolated areas could get 30 inches, forecasters said.Florence could hit the Carolinas harder than any hurricane since Hazel packed 130mph winds in 1954.That Category 4 storm destroyed 15,000 buildings and killed 19 people in North Carolina. In the six decades since then, many thousands of people have moved to the coast.The storm’s first effects were already apparent on barrier islands as dangerous rip currents hit beaches and seawater flowed over a state highway – the harbinger of a storm surge that could wipe out dunes and submerge entire communities. Watches are already in effect for a storm surge that could reach up to 12ft at high tide on a stretch from Cape Fear to Cape Lookout in North Carolina, forecasters said.            A hurricane watch was in effect for Edisto Beach, South Carolina, to Virginia’s southern border, with the first hurricane-force winds arriving late tomorrow.If Florence slows to a crawl just off the coast, it could bring torrential rain all the way into the Appalachian mountains and as far away as West Virginia, causing flash floods, mudslides and other dangerous conditions in places that do not usually get much tropical weather.Craig Fugate, former director of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency, said: “This is going to produce heavy rainfall, and it may not move very fast. The threat will be inland, so I’m afraid, based on my experience at Fema, that the public is probably not as prepared as everybody would like.”National Hurricane Centre director Ken Graham warned that Florence is expected to linger once onshore, downing trees, knocking out electricity and causing widespread flooding.Mr Graham warned that the “staggering” size of the storm means its impacts will be felt far and wide.            The storm’s potential path also includes half a dozen nuclear power plants, pits holding coal-ash and other industrial waste, and numerous pig farms that store animal waste in massive open-air lagoons."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped.

The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notified by letter.\nWednesday 12 Sep 2018 3:02 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117295.jpg","title":"Lack of 999 cover for busy Harley weekend","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nAVIEMORE was covered by only a single-manned ambulance for most of the Harley Davidson Thunder in the Glens rally, it has emerged.\nIt means that a casualty could be attended to but not taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the event of an emergency until a second ambulance crew had arrived at the scene.\nIt is understood the village only had an ambulance with single crew rather than double crew available last Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday until 5pm.\nThere were an estimated 3000 motorcyclists in the area for the UK\u0027s biggest Harley rally.\nGMB Scotland also said Kingussie only had a single manned crew in operation from just after midnight on Thursday until Sunday morning.\nThe union said the situation is simply not acceptable and poses a real danger.\nAlong with the Strathy, the GMB has been calling for the Scottish Ambulance Service to get rid of the current on-call system and to replace it with 24/7 shifts to bring the Aviemore base into line with most other stations in Scotland.\nJohn Marr, GMB branch secretary, said: \"Only a first responder service would have been able to be provided by an ambulance with single crew.\n\"This would have involved looking after the casualty at the location until back up arrived.\n\"We think it is dangerous and we are stepping up our calls on the government to provide the Scottish Ambulance Service with the funds required to give Badenoch and Strathspey the service the area deserves.\n\"At the moment we are going round in circles asking why there is no 24/7 cover despite Aviemore being one of the busiest tourism spots in the whole of Scotland.\n\"We have repeatedly informed the Scottish Ambulance Service that this is a dangerous situation but nothing is happening.\"\nHighland Council convener and local councillor Bill Lobban, said: \"The current level of ambulance cover is clearly completely unacceptable.\n\"Given our population added to the huge number of visitors we see on a daily basis the Scottish Ambulance Service needs to make sure we have sufficient staff on duty to provide a safe and effective service.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold. If the Irish government is serious about joining us in this fight, then they can allocate these two new seats to the north,\" she said. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead Ennis\nThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday 11th, September. \nThousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. \n“Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. \n“The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying:

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

After the Act of Remembrance, Bro Ward laid a wreath at the Herron family memorial plaque which was unveiled on the boundary wall of Dromore Orange Hall in April 2016 and is the only tangible memorial in Dromore to the history of the Troubles.  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTown draper, William Herron , his wife Elizabeth  and daughter Noeline  died in the blaze after an incendiary device was planted in their Market Square drapery store in April 1976. The fire destroyed much of the shop and the family home above it, where the three victims died from suffocation. Bro William Herron was a member of Closkelt LOL 415 in Rathfriland District LOL No 3.\n\n* A series of commemorative events also took place across Northern Ireland last weekend as the Institution marked its inaugural Orange Victims Day. The Loyal Order formally remember the 335 Orangemen and one Orangewoman murdered by terrorists during the Troubles. The day, which will become an annual event, also highlighted the ongoing plight of the injured and bereaved.\n\n\n   \n                 .

It was this love of numeracy that led Timothy to establish Maths Improvement NI, a programme to support good practice in the teaching of maths. This was disseminated throughout schools in Northern Ireland with great success.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTimothy had a love for children and had their best interests at heart. He was able to engage easily with his pupils and use his talents to help them reach their potential. His sense of humour and fun was shared and enjoyed by the children of St Mary’s. Timothy instilled in his pupils many of the values that he held dear respect, good manners, fairness, courtesy and decency, to name a few!\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTimothy was an avid supporter of Gaelic Games. He was an enthusiastic GAA coach in St Mary’s and loved the success his teams achieved at school and county level. Alongside Clann Na Banna, he established the “Gaelic League” in 1991 and its legacy continues today. Due to his influence and encouragement, many were attracted to Gaelic games, who otherwise may not have been.\n\nTimothy left a lasting impression upon all those who made his acquaintance, in both his personal and professional life. He was a true gentleman with a kind and caring heart and had the talent of making others feel at ease. Timothy made time for everyone and was undoubtedly the ‘life and soul’ of many a school outing and staff celebration. His presence will be greatly missed. His colleagues and friends cherish fond memories of the ‘yarns’ and ‘craic’ they shared. He was an inspiration to everyone and the school feels truly blessed to have know him: ‘You will be forever in our hearts.’ \n\n“He kept at true good humour’s mark, the social flow of pleasure’s tide. He never made a brow look dark, nor caused a tear, but when he died.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8629133.1536492348!/image/image.jpg","title":"ulster and ireland rugby star rory best given freedom honour","story":"\nSome of the biggest names from the world of rugby union gathered at the Archbishop\u0026#8217s Palace in Armagh to witness Rory Best\u0026#8217s conferment with the Freedom of the Borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon.\n\n                \nThe lord Mayor, alderman and councillors awarded the honour to the Ulster, Ireland and Lions rugby star – only the second-ever granted - on Saturday to recognise his huge contribution to both sport and the community in the borough.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nRory Best celebrates receiving the freedom of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n The ceremony, hosted by BBC rugby commentator Jim Neilly, saw Rory accept the Freedom Scroll from the Lord Mayor and sign the Book of Honorary Burgesses.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n As well as family and friends of Rory Best and members of council, attendees included rugby stars Conor Murray, David Wallace, Mike Ross and Andrew Trimble, and a host of others.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n Dr Rory Best OBE said: “To receive the Freedom of the Borough is such a great honour, particularly as it comes from the area where I grew up, where I learned my rugby and where I live. This borough has given so much to me over the years and I am thankful to everybody who has helped me throughout my rugby career so far.\n\n “I would like to thank the council for considering me for this honour and for arranging today’s very special event. I have had the privilege to take part in some memorable sporting occasions and today’s will live long in the memory with the best of them.”\n\n Earlier in the day Rory attended a special Festival of Rugby held at City of Armagh Rugby Club made up of teams from clubs across the borough including Banbridge RFC, Dromore RFC, Lurgan RFC, Portadown RFC and City of Armagh RFC, as well as rugby neighbours Dungannon RFC and Monaghan RFC.  Portadown Panthers opened the festival with an exhibition game of tag rugby, of which Rory is the club patron.\n\n Lord Mayor Julie Flaherty said: “Today has been a real celebration of Rory Best’s sporting achievements and the contribution he makes to our borough. He thoroughly deserves the Freedom of the Borough honour and we could ask for no better example for our young people to follow, both on and off the pitch.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n “The fantastic turnout from the world of provincial and international rugby is testament to the regard with which Rory is held in the professional game, as are the tributes from some of the stalwarts of the game.”\n\n Dr Rory Best OBE received the Freedom of the Borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon in recognition of his outstanding sporting achievements of a local man who was raised and educated in Poyntzpass and went to Tandragee Junior High and Portadown College. He played rugby for Banbridge and his wife Jodie teaches in The Armstrong Primary School, Armagh.\n\n Rory has won a raft of honours in the rugby world, including captaining Ulster, Ireland and the British and Irish Lions earning more than 100 caps for Ireland and more than 200 for Ulster leading Ireland to a third Grand Slam and Triple Crown in 2018 also leading Ireland to historic wins over the New Zealand All Blacks, South Africa and Australia and being part of the Ulster side which reached a Heineken Cup final in 2012.\n\n As part of the Freedom of the Borough celebrations, some of Rory’s most memorable items from his playing career are on display in a special exhibition in the Archbishop’s Palace in Armagh\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nItems on display include the match ball from the Ireland rugby team’s historic win over the New Zealand All Blacks in Chicago in 2016 Rory’s shirt from the Six Nations Championship Grand Slam winning game against England in 2018 the boots worn by the hooker on his 200th cap for Ulster in 2017 and his captain’s shirt from the Lions game against the Chiefs on the tour of New Zealand in 2017.\n\nThe exhibition is open until Sunday, September 16 from 10am to 5pm and 7pm to 9pm on weekdays and 2pm to 5pm at weekends, it will be closed on Saturday 8th September and Wednesday 12th September.

However, on Botanic Avenue, which is especially popular with students, business owners begin to feel the pinch as the University term ends in December.\nRichard Walker, owner of The Other Place on Botanic’s thoroughfare, said that extending the Christmas lights would not only improve trade, but also the festive atmosphere in South Belfast.\n“Botanic Avenue is usually a very vibrant and busy area, but what we have discovered over the last couple of years is that when the Christmas lights are put up and the Christmas market comes that a lot of our customers want to go down into the city centre,” he said.\n“They want to be part of the buzz and the festivities. On Botanic Avenue we notice a lull in trade around that time.\n“We are very busy with the students returning around September up until November time. As soon as it gets close to Christmas time there is a massive downturn in trade.\n“People are going into the city centre because they want to be part of the fun. The economy is very poor at the minute and a lot of restaurants are really struggling so we rely on Christmas to help our performance throughout the year, because come January when everybody has spent their money eating out is the last thing they want to do. It puts us under a lot of pressure.”\nHe continued: “Festivals and events like the Christmas market are great for the local economy, but in Botanic Avenue and the Ormeau where we aren’t part of the city festive programme we see a drop in footfall.\n“With the tourist boom that we’ve had over the summer, we’ve seen that a lot of tourists are getting off the train at Botanic train station, and with the opening of the Grand Central Hotel, they are walking up Botanic Avenue, going to the Ulster Museum and Botanic Park. I would like that to be part of the route map for Christmas, so that we can keep that going.\n“I have spoken to a lot of local traders here and they are all very much of the same mindset. We want Botanic and Ormeau to be part of the Christmas spirit –It’s good craic. My staff would certainly like to be coming to work seeing the Christmas lights and getting into the spirit. I think it’s a good idea for local traders and the local residents too.”\nBotanic Councillor Declan Boyle said that bringing the festivities to the area is “great idea”.\n“The Christmas market is  good but I think we need to spread people out to other parts of the city too,” said.\n“The business owners pay rates and they should be given a bit of help and assistance. In Botanic Avenue their market, by and large, is university students and in the middle of December when they go it’s very quiet, so it would do no harm to help out those businesses there.\n“For the rest of the year it’s a thriving place, it has a great bohemian mix, so I think the area should be assisted in the Christmas months. It’s only a small stretch of road, and it wouldn’t have a terrible expense attached to it, so I would be very much in favour of it.”\n________________________________________\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"dont deport us back to iraq","story":"\nTWO junior Iraqi doctors who fled their war-torn nation due to death threats made to one of their lives, say they hope the Home Office will reconsider its decision to imminently deport them due to complications with their visa.\n\nSpeaking from their home off Lisburn Road’s Chadwick Street, Yosra Taleb Abdalla who shares the property with her husband Usamah Ather Ali and two young children – one of whom is aged just 20 months –  explained how she and Ali had been working as junior doctors when Ali, who worked for the Ministry for Defence in Baghdad, received a threat to his life. \n\n“We applied for a visa to Dublin and then went onto Belfast,” said Yosra. “We have been here nearly three years, from the beginning of January 2016.”\n\nYosra continued: “The people here have been extremely kind to us and the children enjoy the multicultural side of life.\n\n“We feel safe here, we are safe here we feel that no-one can hurt us here.”\n\nYosra explained how the Home Office decision, which was made in late July, refused the family’s submission for asylum and to date the family have received no further correspondence as to when they have to leave the country.\n\nAs both Yosra and Ali have not successfully secured asylum neither can work, leaving the family in limbo.\n\n“We fear we will forget all we have learned in our profession,” said Yosra. “It is our hope to work.\n\n“We were doctors in our home country, we were living a normal life, and now we are here trying to live our lives. We don’t know what to expect from the future. Our  youngest is only 20 months old and our son is going to be four in November.\n\n “We want a chance to prove ourselves and return to our normal life as we are very frustrated with the way things are and for our young family. It is a extremely stressful time for us and we would ask the Home Office for further reconsideration.”\n\nSouth Belfast MLA Máirtín Ó Muilleoir, who has been supporting the family, said he would be asking the Home Office to look again at their case and allow the young family to remain in the city where they have been embraced by the local community.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: “Each asylum application is carefully considered on its merits against background country information to ensure that only genuine claims are granted.\n\n“Where a decision has been made that a person does not require international protection, and there are no remaining rights of appeal or obstacles to their return, we expect individuals to return voluntarily to their home country.\n\n“The Home Office\u0026#8217s full range of country policy and information notes  is available at https:www.gov.uk/government/collections/country-information-and-guidance.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"summers bountiful harvest is celebrated in colin","story":"\n\n\nTHE strong green-fingered growers at Colin Allotments celebrated a successful end of summer harvest on Thursday by sharing the bountiful fruits  of their labour with the local community.\nThe Colin Harvest Festival brought people from all over the community together for the celebration. Visitors were treated to displays from traditional musicians, the Colin Men’s Shed, Belfast Beekeeper’s Association, and, of course, the gardeners themselves.\nThis year’s harvest produced a colourful cornucopia of fruit and veg – a beautiful, healthy and tasty reward for all of the allotment owners’ hard graft.\nMichael George, from Colin Neighbourhood Partnership, hailed their success, stating it was “the best year yet” for the allotments.\n“This is all great produce from the allotment holders themselves and we have local honey from the hives on site,” he said.\n“We have all of these different organisations here giving advice and information about growing and sustainable living.\n“This is a very important project for the Colin area because it’s helping local people grow their own vegetables, and stay healthy. We want to promote sustainable living. With Brexit coming along, fruit and vegetables are getting dearer every day.\n“I have a plot here myself and I’ve eaten the vegetables from the plot all summer. It’s a money saver, it’s organic, you can taste the difference and it keeps you healthy too.”\nHe continued: “I couldn’t get over the displays. The last couple of years have been good, but this is the best year yet. The community are really into it – it’s a great celebration.”\nBelfast’s first citizen, Cllr Deirdre Hargey, who came along to judge the stunning displays, said: “It’s a brilliant day. When you’re up here and you see the scale of the allotments in the Colin area it’s amazing. It’s brilliant for the city, it’s brilliant for the community and our young people.\n“It teaches people to grow their own food – healthier food, more natural food – and encouraging people to actually eat fruit and veg.\n“You can see that the demand for this community activity is growing too.\n“It’s particularly important when you look at the health issues in the city relating to diet including obesity. This helps change the culture of unhealthy eating.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the community group that took on a giant","story":"\n\nMONEY\n breeds power, or so the idiom goes, but five years ago when plans were revealed for a quarter-billion pound waste incinerator in Glengormley, it sparked a grassroots community campaign that would go on to take on big capital and even the government.\nThe NoArc21 campaign started when a small group of concerned residents called a public meeting to voice their concerns about Becon Consortium’s plans to build an incinerator near homes on the Hightown Road.\nVice-chair of NoArc21, Charlie Thompson, said the danger posed by the incinerator and the anger caused by it was enough to mobilise the community.\n“The anger was bad because at that stage there was problems with the dump in Mallusk and the smells coming from the incinerator down there,” he said.\n“This area was very much seen as a dumping ground. It was like we were living in the middle of a tip. The actual incinerator would be right outside my windows. I would be looking at it every day if it was to go ahead.\n“We were told lies about the size of it too. We were told it would be all hidden and that we wouldn’t even notice it. This thing is going to be the size of Wembley Stadium or Croke Park and it’s supposed to be less than a half a mile from my front windows – I think I would see the thing.\n“I was very angry at the size and scale of it, but there is evidence out there now that these things cause cancer. The size can’t be underestimated either – it will be the single biggest freestanding building in Northern Ireland.\n“It will have a chimney stack that’s over 90 metres long. The evidence all says anyone living up to a kilometre-and-a-half away will be those worse affected. This thing is going to be pouring toxins over my family, my neighbours and everybody within a kilometre at best, but at worse the catchment area could be 15k. Almost all of the Belfast basin will be inhaling this and it’s already one of the most polluted cities in Europe, in terms of air pollution. This is just going to make it worse.”\nHe continued: “As soon as I got involved there was a small committee set up and we identified all the problems that could be associated with it.\n“After the waste is burned there is a substance left over called fly-ash, which is extremely toxic. If any of the lorries carrying it were involved in an accident, and this is a busy road, then all of that would be released into the air.\n“This is in an expanding residential area. The impact on that is huge.\n“We have evidence as well that it would reduce house prices. We estimated that it would reduce house prices by ten to 20 per cent, but we now have people who have come forward who can’t get a mortgage on their homes because there is a negative equity risk.\n“The evidence is very, very clear this causes lung infections, cancers, and lung conditions. While the incinerator complies with existing legal policies and regulations, they have never ever said it was safe.\n“Any opportunity I have had with Arc21 I have asked them if they could stand up in front of the public and say that the facility is safe. They have never said that – they have said it complies with existing policies and regulations, but those are already out of date, and are being reviewed as we speak.”\nWhile the anger amongst residents was palpable during the foundation of the NoArc21 campaign, Charlie said that channelling those energies and sustaining the group has been “extremely tough”.\n“Because of the threat it was easy at times to get people on board, but the issue is sustaining the campaign,” he explained.\n“We had a problem with apathy. When Mark H Durkan was environment minister he shot dead the application, and people thought it was dead in the water. We then had to go to the Planning Appeals Commission and we lost.\n“That said, in the history of Northern Ireland this has had the most objections to any planning application – over 4,000 people have gone to the trouble of submitting an objection.\n“The other thing that has helped us is that we are cross-community. We have been approached by all parties who have offered us assistance, but we have been very careful that we don’t side with one over another. Our group is mixed in terms of background. It doesn’t just impact on any one side of the community. This has been key to us.\n“We have secured funding through online crowdfunding, and people have been very good on that, people have thrown money in buckets for us – it all helps.”\nBy being able to recruit a legal team, NoArc21 were able to challenge the legality of the decision to grant planning permission for the incinerator earlier this year. The High Court ruled the Department for Infrastructure did not have the authority to grant permission in the absence of a minister. Charlie said that the group were “happy and shocked” by the decision, but said that they still might have a fight on their hands.\n“We’re a small community group, so this is all new to us,” he stated.\n“We didn’t think for a minute that we would win – we were hoping that we would win and we were fighting from every angle. We pulled in experts who were offering free advice and services.\n“When we heard the High Court Ruling we were delighted. We had a very strong legal team, but we were still very surprised. We always knew that this facility was wrong in this area.\n“Fighting it legally for us was a big challenge for us and we may have to do it again. The Department for Infrastructure won’t appeal, but the Attorney General submitted a series of questions that could affect the High Court decision.\n“I’m not going to say that we didn’t expect the decision to have huge ramifications, but we didn’t think that it would stall the governing of Northern Ireland. There are so many things that are held up because of this. With the Attorney General submitting those questions, there’s a chance that this will go to the Supreme Court in London, and that’s something that we have to prepare for.”\nHe added: “We are optimistic, however, if we lose on one issue this could be enough to put this back to a decision for a minister to take, whether that be a direct rule minister, or if Stormont is back up and running.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ballymurphy massacre documentary maker macrae defends film as providing balance to false official narrative","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They included a priest attending to those wounded and a mother of eight.\n\nIn the documentary it heard how that mother, Joan Connolly, lay crying on the ground until she passed away.\n\nAnother man died of a heart attack following an alleged violent confrontation with the troops in the estate.\n\nThe shootings took place as the Army moved in to republican strongholds to arrest IRA suspects in the wake of the introduction of the controversial policy of internment without trial.\n\nSoldiers have long been held responsible for killing the 10 people in Ballymurphy but the accepted narrative became clouded earlier this year when former UVF members came forward to claim their organisation was also involved.\n\nInquests into the deaths are due to open in November.\n\n\n \nDate set for new inquest into Ballymurphy massacre\n \n\n\nFilmmaker Callum Macrae, rejected criticism the piece did not tell \"the whole story\" in that it did not go into the context of the major gun battles around the time or give the \"full context\" about the actions of paramilitaries including the IRA at the time.\n\nHe said: \"The description - which is widely held by people in the UK - that Protestants and Catholics were at each others throats, the Provisional IRA was an incredibly dangerous force rushing around killing people and the British Army was sent in as the patsies, the guys in the middle, trying to restore order and peace - that is the official narrative, it is accepted by almost everybody in Britain - and it is simply not true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelfast IRA men with a drogue bomb in 1987\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I tell people the Provisional IRA did not exist until several months after the Army arrived, they are astonished. Because there is a false narrative. \n\n\"So to describe what I am doing as some kind of false unbalanced narrative is just simply wrong.\n\n\"My film actually is the balance to the official narrative which is fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nMr Macrae said \"of course the IRA\" were active at the time of the Ballymurphy massacre. \n\n\"The British Army described very clearly a \u0027major gun battle\u0027, with upwards of 700 rounds being fired at soldiers. The Army, specifically in a statement to the Belfast , claimed there were 20 gunmen coming down from the top of the hill onto the Whiterock Road and the Army fought a two-hour battle involving Thompson sub-machine guns, pistols and rifles.\"\n\nHe said the reports from the time - based on what the British Army had said happened - although \"well-intentioned\" were \"transparently untrue\".\n\n\"They talk about wiping out a \u0027hardcore IRA unit\u0027,\" he went on.\n\n\"Now I have been looking into this for four years and there is not a shred of credible evidence I can find to say any of that is true.\"\n\nHe added: \"Let me be clear - I am no apologist for the IRA. \n\n\"No one can say there was no IRA present - I am certainly not saying that. \n\n\"What we can say for sure is no one can say for certain there were no armed paramilitaries present. And we do mention the UVF claim.\n\n\"We said most of the IRA had been tipped off and most of their members had left, that\u0027s what the IRA claimed.\"\n\nQuoting Gerry Adams who claimed a \"small number\" of IRA remained to offer \"token resistance\", Mr Mccrae said there were no guns found, ammunition or shells and two of those killed had been shot in the back.\n\n\"Not for a second do I deny the IRA were there,\" he added.\n\n\"What the army claim is \u0027a large number of IRA were involved with sub machine guns\u0027. I have looked very hard for four years and can not find evidence of it. \n\n\"Nonetheless - even though I can\u0027t find evidence of it, does not mean it didn\u0027t happen.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast road is most clamped street in northern ireland drivers spend 34k to","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

in Belfast is the most clamped street or road in Northern Ireland, new figures have revealed.

road is in Belfast is the most clamped street or road in Northern Ireland, new figures have revealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nDepartment for Infrastructure statistics show 16 vehicles were clamped on the Lisburn Road between the start of 2016 and the end of June this year.\n\nIt was almost double the number of clampings carried out on Chichester Street, Northern Ireland\u0027s second most clamped street.\n\nBotanic Avenue, Great Victoria Street, and King Street all had eight clampings each.\n\nBetween January 2016 and June of this year Northern Ireland\u0027s motorists paid out £34,581 to have clamps removed from their cars.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u0027s 10 most clamped roads and streets were all in the Belfast City Council area.\n\nIn 2016 there were 254 cars clamped in Northern Ireland, 305 cars were clamped in 2017, and 91 cars were clamped in the first six months of 2018.\n\nIn Northern Ireland there are two reasons to clamp a car.\n\nAction can be taken for an unpaid penalty charge notice, or against vehicles parked in urban clearways and bus lanes.\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Infrastructure said clamping had been an effective measure to prevent traffic offences.\n\nClamping was introduced for cars parked in urban clearways and bus lanes on March 5.\n\nBetween that date and the end of June 35 cars were clamped and removed for that reason.\n\nThe rule was introduced to stop motorists blocking the main arteries into Belfast by parking illegally.\n\nEnforcement is carried out for the Department for Infrastructure by contractor NSL Services Group.\n\nDrivers are required to pay a charge of £40 to have a clamp removed if the car has been removed to a nearby street, or £105 if the car has been taken to the vehicle pound .\n\nSpeaking at the time of the launch of the measure, Ciaran de Burca, Department for Infrastructure director of transport projects, said: \"Vehicles parked in urban clearway routes and bus lanes during operational hours cause significant delays and congestion for commuters and other road users, particularly during the morning and evening peak traffic hours.\n\n\"For drivers who choose to ignore urban clearway and bus lane regulations, this specially designed enforcement vehicle will carry out the removal and clamping of illegally parked vehicles, leaving main routes unobstructed during these key times and allowing other road users to continue on their journeys without the unnecessary delay caused.\"\n\nEarlier this year the issue of clamping was in the headlines after footage emerged of Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly removing a clamp from his car, raising questions about the legality of clamping a vehicle in a private car park.\n\nSpeaking after the incident, legal expert Joshua Rozenberg said clamping legislation had not been updated in Northern Ireland since the 1970s and differed substantially from other parts of the UK.\n\nClamping on private land in England and Wales became an offence in 2012 under the Protection of Freedom Act, with the same law having been in place in Scotland since 2002.\n\nHowever, it remains legal in Northern Ireland.\n\nCompanies here can still hire contractors to clamp private cars on their land, although companies able to do this must be licensed by the Security Industry Authority  and are regulated by the British Parking Authority.\n\nThe maximum fee private contractors can charge to free a car from a clamp in Northern Ireland is £100.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"final recommendations for northern ireland electoral boundary changes published","story":"\n Hi

Under the proposals, published on Monday, Northern Ireland will have 17 constituencies down one from the current 18.\n\n\n\nPlans to split a town into three voting zones dropped\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland electoral boundary changes - what constituency are you in?\n\n\n\nInteractive map: Northern Ireland electoral boundary changes\n \n\n\nThe changes would see two constituencies relatively unchanged, namely Foyle and Fermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone. There would be four new constituencies - Sperrin, Causeway, Mid Antrim and Mid Down.\n\n\nFlashback to 2017 General Election results: \n\nEast Belfast\n .... \nNorth Belfast \n\n\n.... \nSouth Belfast\n \n\n.... \nWest Belfast \n\n\n.... \nEast Antrim \n\n\n.... \nEast Londonderry \n\n\n.... \nFermanagh \u0026 South Tyrone\n \n\n.... \nFoyle \n\n\n.... \nLagan Valley \n \n\n.... \n\n\nMid Ulster \n \n\n.... \nNewry \u0026 Armagh \n\n\n.... \nNorth Antrim \n \n\n.... \nNorth Down\n \n\n.... \nSouth Antrim\n \n\n.... \nSouth Down\n \n\n.... \nStrangford \n \n\n.... \nUpper Bann  \n\n\n....\nWest Tyrone  \n\n\n....\n\nEleven remain with the same name, although their boundaries are altered. They are the four sets in Belfast, East Antrim, Mid Ulster, Newry and Armagh, North Down, South Antrim, South Down and Upper Bann.\n\nAnd effectively disappearing - because there would be no obvious successor in the new plans - would be North Antrim, Lagan Valley, Strangford, East Londonderry and West Tyrone.\n\nA previous proposal to reduce Belfast to three constituencies has disappeared.\n\nThe iations in the number of people living in each constituency would be reduced - meaning they would be closer in size in terms of people represented.\n\nCurrently the smallest constituency is East Antrim with 59,658 electors on December 2015, while the largest is Upper Bann with 80,218.\n\nUnder the Boundary Commission plans the smallest would become Upper Bann with 69,795 people eligible to vote and the largest, Mid Down, with 77,767.\n\n\n\nThe Boundary Commission has been working on the changes since 2013 and the final recommendations come after a large scale consultation process. Almost 10,000 petition signatures and letters were received by the organisation.\n\nThe matter will be put to parliament and debated before new legislation is put in place to enact the changes, if a vote approves the changes.\n\nDeputy Chair of the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland, Madam Justice Denise McBride DBE, QC said: \"The Boundary Commission has determined its final recommendations after careful consideration of all the evidence collected during three stages of open and transparent public consultation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final recommendation proposes 17 constituencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Commission is grateful to all those who took the time and trouble to respond. We have sought, where possible, to try and accommodate the wide range of views and proposals presented whilst remaining within the constraint of the statutory criteria imposed upon the 2018 Review.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland citizens assembly set to meet next month","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It will give ordinary people a real voice on the future of social care – an issue that impacts us all, but especially those already most vulnerable. \n\n\"It’s such a complex and emotive topic that the space for careful deliberation on the values we want our social care system to embody is badly needed.\"\n\nIn recent years, the citizens\u0027 assembly in the Republic, known as the Constitutional Convention, has made recommendations which acted as a precursor to referendums on changing the Irish Constitution\u0027s stance on abortion and same-sex marriage. \n\nFunding for the event is provided by Building Change Trust, which gives backing to voluntary sector organisations in Northern Ireland, with £100,000 given to public-participation charity Involve to run the event. \n\nThe Citizens\u0027 Assembly will meet over two weekends at a hotel in Belfast on October 26-28 and November 16-18. \n\nIn a statement on the official Citizens\u0027 Assembly website, it says those taking part will be: \"taken through a facilitated process of learning, dialogue and deliberation. The process will be designed to ensure participants receive the evidence they require to make informed recommendations.\"\n\nParticipants will discuss Northern Ireland\u0027s social care system, looking at the roles that the health service, communities and individuals play in it. \n\n\"The output from this process will be realistic recommendations to bring the social care system into the 21st century, and future-proof it to cope with the needs of the next generations within the context of limited resources,\" the statement reads. \n\nAlthough it is hoped the Assembly will be a fresh democratic instrument, any recommendations it makes will be advisory and it has not legislative or statutory decision-making powers.  \n"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures rory mcilroys swanky florida pad on the market","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

almost 3m more than he paid for it in 2013.\n\nBuilt in 2010, the sun-soaked deluxe pad boasts six bedrooms, a fully-equipped gym, nine bathrooms, a swimming pool and a private jetty that serves a nearby lake.\n\nThe 10,500sq ft home has been tastefully decorated in greys and beige, with a pool table in one of the leisure rooms.\n\nThere\u0027s even a putting green in the grounds where the Holywood-born golfer could take out the clubs and get in a little after-hours practice if the mood took him.\n\nRory and his American wife Erica Stoll - who hails from the same area of Palm Beach where the house was sold - have now moved into a new home once owned by golf legend Ernie Els in nearby Jupiter.\n\nRory and Erica married in April last year at Ashford Castle in Cong, Co Mayo.\n\nThe couple first met when the stunning New Yorker was working manager of championship volunteer operations for the Professional Golf Association of America.\n\nShe famously woke McIlroy up after he had slept in during the Ryder Cup in 2012.\n\nThe new owner of the former McIlroy mansion, which the golfer originally paid £7.2m for, has not been revealed.\n\nIn 2013, McIlroy sold a five-bedroom house with its own golf driving range and putting green at Moneyreagh, Co Down, for £2m. \n\nThe 14-acre estate also boasted five bedrooms and a gymnasium.\n\nIn 2014 the golfer bought a property in Holywood through Simon Brien Residential estate agents.\n\nHe also snapped up a three-storey building there, described as having been sub-divided into five apartments.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"things karen bradley never knew viral trend after secretary of state admits lack of northern ireland knowledge","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Parties split on ERG blueprint\n \n\n\n\nIn a new paper, they propose the Government should agree equivalence of UK and EU regulations for the safety of agricultural products and allow EU inspectors into Northern Ireland to check on their implementation.\n\n\n\nThe EU will be able to maintain the integrity of its internal market without erecting a hard border along its border with Northern Ireland.\nEuropean Research Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland and the Republic would be maintained as a Common Biosecurity Zone after Brexit, allowing the smooth movement of these goods across the border.\n\n“Since UK and EU standards are identical and will remain identical at the point of departure, determining equivalence after Brexit should be straightforward,” said the document.\n\nFor other goods, the ERG said existing simplified customs procedures could continue to be used to avoid the need for checks at the border.\n\nLarger companies would use “trusted trader” schemes to clear their goods for export and import, and other declarations would be incorporated into the existing system used for VAT returns.\n\nThe ERG paper said that Brussels had made “a major error” in listening almost solely to the warnings of Leo Varadkar’s government in Dublin on the potential for the border issue to disrupt the peace process, contrasting his administration’s stance with the “co-operative and practical” approach of predecessor Enda Kenny.\n\nWarnings that manned checkpoints at the border would become a target for terrorists fail to recognise that checks are already conducted for tax, VAT, currency, excise duties and security without the need for any physical intervention at the border, said the group.\n\nThey cited customs chiefs from the UK and the Republic who have said they do not expect new infrastructure to be needed after Brexit.\n\nThey argued the Withdrawal Agreement proposals on the border are themselves a “clear breach” of the Good Friday Agreement, which requires decisions on the future of the border to remain a matter for the people of Northern Ireland.\n\n“The key obstacle in the negotiations is the EU’s concern that goods could enter into the Single Market area through the Irish border without being compliant with EU standards or tariffs,” said the ERG paper, launched in Westminster.\n\n“The question for the EU is whether this risk to the integrity of the Single Market is so serious that it could block a Free Trade Agreement with the UK.”\n\nAnd it added: “In the debate over solutions to the Northern Ireland border issue, a proper sense of scale, perspective or proportionality has been lost.\n\n“The EU’s objections are political not practical. The Government has failed to set out what can be done to provide for customs compliance without physical checks or infrastructure on the Northern Ireland border.”\n\nThe document said that, under the ERG’s proposals, “the EU will be able to maintain the integrity of its internal market without erecting a hard border along its border with Northern Ireland.\n\n“At the same time, the United Kingdom will be able to develop a fully independent trade policy rather than remaining a rule-taker.”\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg arrives at the Royal United Services Institute in Whitehall to discuss the group’s proposals \n\n\n\n\nAnd it added: “This allows the United Kingdom to conduct an independent trade policy without threatening the integrity of the EU single market.”\n\nThe ERG shrugged off the prospect of an open border in Ireland becoming a route for illegal immigration into the UK.\n\nIn practice, immigration is prevented not at the border, but by measures to make it difficult for illegals to obtain work, accommodation and welfare, said the paper.\n\nIn response to EU concerns that goods that do not meet its standards – like US genetically-modified crops and chlorine-washed chicken – might enter its markets via Northern Ireland, the ERG said that such breaches could be handled in the same way police on both sides of the border currently tackle smuggling of drugs, fuel or alcohol.\n\n“Law-enforcement agencies on both sides of the border co-operate to suppress smuggling without anyone suggesting that border posts and checks would make their efforts more effective,” said the ERG.\n\n“If they can tackle trade in drugs, fuel, tobacco and alcohol without infrastructure at the border, they can prevent non-compliant goods from the UK reaching Irish retail outlets in the same way.”\n\nThe ERG said its proposals could be delivered without weakening North-South co-operation.\n\n“There is nothing which would reduce our commitment to the Belfast Agreement, or which might jeopardise peace in Northern Ireland,” the group said.\n\n“Harnessing the latest developments in international best practice can deliver continued co-operation and prosperity in the best interests of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"favourite for welsh first minister backs second brexit

He will be replaced by non-executive director David Daly.\n\nMr Hellawell, a former West Yorkshire Police chief constable and government drugs tsar, fielded criticism after allegations of poor working conditions at the retailer’s warehouses came to light.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nKeith Hellawell narrowly survived a re-election vote \n\n\n\n\nHis approach to corporate governance has also come under fire and at last year’s AGM he narrowly survived a re-election vote when 47% of investors voted against him.\n\nSteve Turner, assistant general secretary of union Unite, said: “It’s about time he resigned. During his tenure he has presided over shocking working conditions at the Shirebrook warehouse.\n\n“The question now is will his replacement stand up to  Mike Ashley in the interests of workers and shareholders?”\n\nInfluential advisory groups had urged shareholders to oppose Mr Hellawell’s re-election, arguing he had lost investor confidence and failed to appoint any female directors to the board.\n\n“Having overseen significant improvements in the working practices and corporate governance of the company, which includes a refresh of the board, now is the right time for me to step aside,” Mr Hellawell said on Wednesday.\n\n“I have every confidence that the group will continue to go from strength to strength. I have enjoyed the challenges of Sports Direct and the support of Mike Ashley, many major investors, members of the board and senior staff, and wish them much success for the future.”\n\nA total of 9.8% of investors voted against Mr Ashley’s re-election at the Sports Direct AGM after shareholder advisory groups criticised his “excessive influence” over the company.\n\nSports Direct said it is on track to meet expectations in the current year, as the retailer gears up for its annual meeting.\n\nThe sporting goods group is set for between 5% and 15% growth in underlying earnings, excluding the recent £90 million acquisition of House of Fraser.\n\nShares in Sports Direct were 3.7% higher in afternoon trading on Wednesday at 353.6p.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"why were mps wearing wheat on their lapels at pmqs","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Opponents say they are too hard to put into effect and might lead to filtering or even greater control over the internet.\n\nIf the parliament has its way and the changes are endorsed by EU member states, online platforms would be liable for copyright infringements.\n\nThat would include “snippets” where only a small part of a news publisher’s text is displayed.\n\nMEPs believe the text contains provisions to ensure that copyright law can be respected without limiting freedom of expression. Wikipedia and open source software platforms would not be affected.\n\n“We have addressed concerns raised about innovation by excluding small and micro platforms or aggregators from the scope,” Mr Voss said.\n\n“I am convinced that once the dust has settled, the internet will be as free as it is today, creators and journalists will be earning a fairer share of the revenues generated by their works, and we will be wondering what all the fuss was about.”\n\nThe European Magazine Media Association praised the move as “a great day for the independent press and for democracy,” saying it would modernise the rules without stifling online competition.\n\nBut the Computer and Communications Industry Association said it would “undermine free expression online and access to information”.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"meps back action against hungary for undermining eu values","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

If the abstentions were counted into the final tally, there would have been a total 693 votes, so the 448 in favour would not have reached two-thirds.\n\n\n\nThis is a historic result for Hungarian citizens and for European citizens everywhere.\nJudith Sargentini\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Szijjarto said Hungary was considering legal options to appeal against the result because of the way the vote was tallied.\n\nBut Judith Sargentini, who presented the report prepared by the European Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, welcomed the outcome.\n\n“Viktor Orban’s government has been leading the charge against European values by silencing independent media, replacing critical judges, and putting academia on a leash,” Ms Sargentini said. “The Hungarian people deserve better. They deserve freedom of speech, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice and equality, all of which are enshrined in the European treaties.”\n\n“This is a historic result for Hungarian citizens and for European citizens everywhere, that the European Parliament has voted by a large majority to stand up for the values we all hold dear,” Ms Sargentini said.\n\nEPP leader Mandred Weber, who earlier was supportive of Mr Orban and is seeking to become the European Commission president next year, said he had voted for triggering Article 7.\n\n“I have always been in favour of building bridges and I want to continue to do so, but yesterday  I didn’t see any readiness from the Hungarian PM to make a move towards his EU partners and address our concerns,” Mr Manfred tweeted.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"alex odonnell appreciation","story":"\nThe death occurred on Wednesday, August 23 of veteran Derry Republican, Alex O Donnell, from the Shantallow area of the city.\n\nAlex was a committed lifelong Republican and a founding member of the John Starrs Sinn Féin Cumann in the Branydwell area, which was formed in memory of Vol. John Starrs, who was shot dead by the British Army on May 13, 1972.\n\nLike many other republicans in the early 1970s, Alex was at the forefront of protests and opposition to internment and British rule in Ireland, and when other work needed to be done Alex was never found wanting. \n\nWhen Alex came to live in the Shantallow area he immediately made himself available to the local Republican structures\n\nHis house was always open to republicans no matter what their problems - making sure those on the run had a bed when needed. \n\nHis work on behalf of political prisoners and their families was always at the top of his priorities. \n\nAlex never shied away from his responsibilities and ensured that the Republican struggle continued at a time when many might have faltered. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nHe took a leading role in protests during the Hunger Strikes and was a regular with the late Barney McFadden and other Republicans at Waterloo Place supporting the political prisoners’ struggle in Long Kesh \n\nHe was involved in the first Assembly Elections when Martin McGuinness won a seat in 1982. and was a strong supporter of the Peace Process and the Good Friday Agreement.

Only five players attended a pre-season meeting and Down took the field for their National League opener with barely 15 players.\n\nHowever, Rooney\u0026rsquos infectious enthusiasm has transformed Down and three months later the girls find themselves preparing for an All-Ireland showdown.\n\nSport is such a conundrum. All who have been involved in sport at any level can testify to the many frustrating and heartbreaking defeats sporadically interrupted by moments of sheer elation.\n\nIt\u0026rsquos these infrequent moments that keep players and coaches going year in year out in search of just one more. A half, a game even a season can be changed on a block, tackle, score or win and the momentum gathered can be infectious.\u0026nbsp\n\nA group, seemingly going nowhere except deeper into the abyss are suddenly galvanised, working for one another as if their lives depended on it. Success is like a lightning bolt. It can strike when you least expect it and you must keep the energy and drive going. You have to strike when the iron is hot.\n\nYet, as we all know, fairy tale endings only become fairy tale endings when the underdog performs to their very best and leaves the field of play with no regrets.\n\nOn their day the Down girls are a match for anyone as they have proved a number of times this year and they have also shown that when their backs are against the wall they can and have turned games around.\u0026nbsp\n\nDown have talented players all over the park. They will be led by Clonduff sisters Sara Louise and Fionnuala Carr, who were both on the side that won the All-Ireland Junior crown at Croke Park in 2014.\n\nThrow in in Bredagh\u0026rsquos Catherine Rocks, Liatroim\u0026rsquos Aimee McAleenan and Dearbhla Magee and you have the nucleus of an attack-minded side.\u0026nbsp\n\nHowever, Portaferry\u0026rsquos twin terrors Niamh Mallon \u0026mdash skipper of the 2014 side \u0026mdash and Saoirse Sands are the jewels in the Down crown and they have the potential to cut any defence to shreds and no better place to do that than Croke Park on Sunday.\n\nThere were plenty of raised eyebrows when Down got the better of Tipperary thanks to a 58th minute goal from Sara Louise Carr to reach the Liberty Insurance All-Ireland Intermediate final for the first time in 20 years.\n\nIt may have been a surprise, but there were indications that the Mourne girls were making real progress as the summer evolved.\n\nAdmittedly, the league was a disaster, as they lost all five outings, but then they got the better of Derry in the Ulster final. They followed that up with a draw against the much-fancied Oak Leafers in the opening round of the All-Ireland Championship.\n\nThat laid the platform for the rest of the campaign and they defeated Laois to bag the runners-up spot in Group 1 behind Cork, who had overcome all before them.\n\nTipperary topped Group 2 and were six points clear at half-time in the semi-final, but with the experiment of deploying Fionnuala Carr at full forward dispensed with, there was an immediate improvement as the Clonduff colossus began to exert greater influence from centre back. Nicole Kelly put the shackles on the dangerous Nicola Treacy too.\n\nMeanwhile, Niamh Mallon was busily keeping the umpire busy as she racked up nine points, seven from placed balls. That brought Down in touch and Sara Louise Carr, who got married earlier this year, pounced for the definitive goal to go with her earlier two points from play.\n\nCork will be desperate to get over the line having lost the last two deciders, including last year\u0026rsquos to Meath after a replay.\u0026nbsp\n\nMuch like their senior counterparts, they have cruised through to the final, finishing the group phase with a positive scoring differential of 65 points, compared to Down\u0026rsquos -2. Indeed, the Rebels were 12-point victors when the teams met in P\u0026aacuteirc Esler in July.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe Leesiders possess a lot of firepower with Finola Neville, Caroline Sugrue and Katelyn Hickey well able to hit the target. Minor star Cliona Healy came off the bench to have a big impact in the semi-final win over Galway, scoring three points in as many minutes soon after her second-half introduction to edge the Leesiders clear and finishing with four.\n\nHealy wasn\u0026rsquot involved when the Leesiders garnered the Division 2 League title, but she and a handful of other colleagues from the All-Ireland-winning Minor Championship side have made the step up and with that sort of ability to be called upon, they will be hard to beat.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Arts Centre launches new programme  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWN Arts Centre has announced its latest arts programme.\n\nThe new-look autumn guide, covering September to December, is brimming with a huge range of exhibitions, music, theatre, comedy, talks, classes and workshops.\n\nA ied season of live performances gets off to a comedic start with Owen O\u0026rsquoNeill\u0026rsquos new one man play, \u0026lsquoTen Songs To Die For\u0026rsquo.\u0026nbsp Also billed for the autumn are local comedians Shane Todd with his hilarious brand new stand-up show \u0026lsquoHero\u0026rsquo and Kevin McAleer \u0026mdash a comedy apparition not to be missed.\n\nMusical highlights include celtic and country classics including the Leading Ladies, charismatic singer songwriter Grainne Duffy and the ever popular Illegals with Niamh Kavanagh.\n\nNew to Down Arts Centre is local musician Tony Wright who will provide a unique night of story and song with a killer sound track.\u0026nbsp\n\nAlso not to be missed is The \u0026lsquoLegend of Luke Kelly\u0026rsquo, a spectacular tribute to the greatest folk artist of the 20th century, a definite must-see for all fans.

field, but Chloe and her dad, Kenny, have been unable to find it after it was taken a second time several weeks ago and have appealed for its return.\n\nChloe raised \u0026pound1,000 for the Hospice last summer after opening a pop-up tuck shop at the driveway of her home and raised an additional \u0026pound1,000 this July and August when she opened her camp site in support of the charity which

toilet facilities, helping make it a little home from home.\n\nVisitors from as far away as France and Canada stayed at the camp site with Chloe handing out pens and flyers donated by the Hospice so people were aware of how their money was being spent to help others.\n\nDad Kenny said in addition to the banner being stolen, small signs placed along the side of the road to direct people to the facility were also stolen.\n\n\u0026ldquoChloe has been left disappointed at what happened but I have explained to her that there are more good people in the world than bad and that the money she

community service dedicated to eighth century replica monument  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA REPLICA of St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross at Down Cathedral has been formally unveiled following a cross-community dedication service.\n\nThe replica eighth century cross \u0026mdash which stands an imposing 12-feet high and weighs five tonnes \u0026mdash is located just yards from where the patron saint is buried on the historic Hill of Down, with the Mournes in the distance providing a stunning back.\n\nBishops from the Church of Ireland and Catholic communities took part in last Friday afternoon\u0026rsquos service and they were joined by local clergy and monks from the Holy Cross Monastery in Rostrevor.\n\nFriday\u0026rsquos ceremony had been pencilled in for earlier in the summer but had to be postponed following the discovery of medieval human remains while contractors were preparing the ground for the installation of the cross, carved from Mourne granite excavated from Thomas\u0026rsquo Mountain high up in the mountain range.\n\nThe intricately designed structure was manufactured by the Kilkeel firm of McConnell Brothers and representatives from the firm were joined by Church of Ireland Bishop Harold Miller, Down and Connor Bishop Noel Treanor, the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, and members of the Cathedral Chapter.\n\nDean Hull, who led the short service of dedication, said the ceremony marked a very special day and was delighted a number of people heavily involved in the project were present, including Dr Mike King from the Down County Museum.\n\nDean Hull explained that Dr King played a key role initiating the replica cross project, financed by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.\n\n\u0026ldquoMike worked hard along with others to bring about the cross which replicates one that was in place around 800AD. Inside Down Cathedral, there are some old stones and through research, Mike discovered they were in fact part of the original St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIn some old drawings of the cathedral you can see broken portions of the cross which marked nearby St Patrick\u0026rsquos grave. Obviously this old Celtic cross had fallen down and was broken with some pieces placed inside the church.\n\nDean Hull said Dr King, with the help of Philip Armstrong, redesigned the replica cross based on drawings and sketches and eventually, through the help of McConnell Brothers, the imposing replica cross was produced.\n\nThose in attendance at the dedication ceremony were told that the source of the granite used to make the replica cross was most probably the same as that from which the original was made, Dean Hull said the cross is at the heart of the Christian faith and that because Jesus died on the cross, people are reconciled to God and find forgiveness.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are reconciled to God but through the cross we can be reconciled to each other, with the cross reminding us of our common faith as Christians. It is lovely today that Christians from different traditions are able to stand around this cross today because the cross is a symbol of Christian unity and it reminds us that we have one faith, he continued.\n\nDean Hull said when people look at the cross and reflect back to Patrick and to the days of an undivided church, they are reminded that despite all has happened, \u0026ldquowe are still one in Christ with the cross a symbol of what people have in common\u0026nbsp \u0026mdash Christian unity.\n\nConcluding before the start of a short religious dedication service, Dean Hull thanked the Lecale and Down Historical Society which helped with the restoration project and the former Down Council and current Newry, Mourne and Down Council for their support.\n\nDean Hull\u0026rsquos words were reflected by Bishop Miller, who said a prayer as part of the dedication service along with Bishop Treanor.\n\nThe clerics then gathered at the base of the sculpture where they placed their palms over the imprint of a hand in the cross\u0026rsquos base and were joined by Bishop Grant Le Marque, former Anglican Bishop of the Horn of Africa, who was visiting the Down and Dromore Diocese.\n\n\u0026ldquoHere we have Christian hands together, said Bishop Miller, encouraging other people from all over the world to visit the cathedral to make the same gesture.\n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoThe cross is never just something at a distance it is the very heart of our faith in Christ, our relationship with Christ and our salvation in Christ.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Delight after new Translink bus service is extended to Clough  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA NEW bus service is operating in Clough.\n\nThe Downpatrick to Ballykinlar service is being extended to Clough from this month.

A super effort. The only other male junior, Oliver Robinson,\u0026nbsp did a double. The U-13 boys 100m in 15.15 and a strong run in the 1500m saw him finish in 5\u0026rsquo40.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\nA promising start to his career as a Year 8 athlete. The sole senior of the night was Davy Foster in 1,500m running a fast 4\u0026rsquo50. Maybe Davy will stick to these faster shorter distances to try and keep up with his daughters.\n\nGirls galore\n\nTwo of the aforementioned Foster girls competed in the U-11 girls\u0026rsquo 1200m. In a competitive race Jodi hit the finish line in 4\u0026rsquo17 then not far behind was the always-smiling Kari in an impressive time of 4\u0026rsquo43. They both also tried the long jump.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn the U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 100m EDAC had three runners. Heat one saw Kara Trainor finish well in second place in 15.01. In heat three we saw Lauren Madine win in\u0026nbsp a new PB time of 14.16 and Anna Gardiner come home in 15.67 with Lauren taking the overall win and gold medal for the distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nKara\u0026rsquos time placed her sixth overall. It was pleasing to see them follow the lead of the younger girls by trying a field event as well, in this case the discus. Commendable enthusiasm!\n\nFab five females\n\nThe U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 1500m saw a large field of 14 athletes, five of which were EDAC runners and which also included the top class City of Lisburn athlete Katie McCleery, who is ranked in the top 10 in the UK for her age category over this distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nMcCleery made her intentions clear from the start as she immediately hit the front. Lauren decided to track her run and see how she went and was closely followed by Anna Gardiner, Lucy Foster, Kara Trainor and Emily Burns.\u0026nbsp\n\nAll five EDAC athletes looked superb over the three and three-quarter laps. On the last bend McCleery tried to hold on, but Lauren moved up another gear waiting and cruised past to take first place with 100m to run and crossed the line in a superb time of 4\u0026rsquo57 which is a PB by 18 seconds and puts Lauren 8th in the UK for her age for 2018. That was an outstanding performance.\n\nAnna Gardiner was the next EDAC athlete to finish in 5\u0026rsquo05 which is also a significant PB.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\n\nThe PBs were coming thick and fast as Lucy Foster came home in 5\u0026rsquo17 which was 12 seconds better than her previous best. The ever-improving duo of Kara Trainor and Emily Burns battled it out to the end and almost needed a photo finish to separate them \u0026mdash their times were\u0026nbsp 5.41.34 and 5.41.90. This race was really exciting to watch with brilliant efforts from all the girls. By filling first, third, fourth, seventh and eighth places, in the field of 14, there is surely cause for celebration at the depth of talent within the EDAC ranks.\n\nIcing on the cake\n\nLast girl to race was U-15 rising star Kirsti Foster in the 1500m. The girls were mixed with a strong U-15 boys\u0026rsquo field and Kirsti did not take the race lightly, despite carrying a slight niggle from hockey.\u0026nbsp\n\nShe dominated the girls\u0026rsquo field and beat some of the boys too in her race to finish a strong 5\u0026rsquo12 to provide a fitting finale to the night and to the track season.\n\nLaganside 10k\n\nPaula Radcliffe was obviously the star of the show, but EDAC had a few sparkling performances themselves.\u0026nbsp\n\nPaul Lloyd led the troops home and despite narrowly missing out on the elusive sub 40, he felt that he had given his all in the fast-paced race. His time of 40.08 is tantalisingly close and his consistency has to be commended.\u0026nbsp\n\nPhillip Vint, another man who rarely misses a weekend race, came next in 41.10 with Liam Keenan not far behind in 41.36. Gavin Hynds in 41.45 had plenty to celebrate as this was a PB and proves that marathon training doesn\u0026rsquot always slow you down and must be great morale booster for him.\u0026nbsp\n\nDeirdre v Paula?\n\nDeirdre Weatherall finished in 42.08 and was slightly disappointed with that. However, she was cheered up by the fact that Paula Radcliffe had decided to run in the pack and was seen in chat with ious folk en route.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis gave Deirdre the chance to have a sprint finish to the line with the women\u0026rsquos marathon world record holder.\n\nPaula also has European and World Championship medals too numerous to mention as well the accolade of four times Olympian. Many would defer to such greatness, but Deirdre is well known for her fresh-faced enthusiasm and took no time to decide that having a result sheet with her name one place ahead of Paula\u0026rsquos was an opportunity unlikely to be repeated.\n\nAfter reading on Wikipedia that Deirdre is described as the foremost tragic heroine in Irish legend and probably its best-known figure in modern times, she could probably argue that Paula should have been in awe of her rather than the other way round.\n\nThis is the spirit that is key to Deirdre\u0026rsquos rise in the ranks and long may it continue.\n\nLiam Smyth \u0026mdash veteran in terms of longevity in these events clocked up a respectable 44.42. Behind him another historic event was unfolding.\n\nGavin McConvey came in to the finish line in 53.51 declaring that the last time he saw a sub 54 minute 10K was in 2004. Not bad going Gavin, keep it up.\u0026nbsp\n\nRoisin Gaffney, another reliable EDAC runner, finished in 54.09 and for once found, despite her love of the sun, that the heat was oppressive and was glad to be done.\n\nDonal at the double\n\nDonal Smith headed to Kildare on Saturday to take part in an a 5k run in aid of the Injured Jockeys\u0026rsquo Fund - but having discovered that there was a 10K race nearby he decided in true horse lovers\u0026rsquo form to hedge his bets and do both. He did say afterwards that it was a lot for one day and he may need a few rest days, but knowing Donal, that won\u0026rsquot last for long.\n\nNo one from the club made their way to Derry on Sunday morning for the Waterside Half Marathon which this year was also the NI and Ulster Half Marathon Championships.\n\nWhat\u0026rsquos ahead?\n\nThis will probably come too late for regular readers of the weekly papers, but Tuesday is the night for the annual trek to Castlewellan for the lung busting, for some, Mill Hill Mile Challenge.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis is a race that is, or should be, on everybody\u0026rsquos bucket list so if you\u0026rsquore going don t\u0026rsquo forget you must register online beforehand.

They were freed on bail later that evening.\n\nAiring last November, the Alex Gibney-directed documentary was a hard-hitting examination of claims of state collusion in the murders, which broke new ground by publicly naming alleged suspects.\n\nThe six men killed in Loughinisland were Adrian Rogan, Barney Green, Dan McCreanor, Eamon Byrne, Malcolm Jenkinson and Patsy O\u0026rsquoHare.\n\nClare Rogan, wife of Adrian Rogan, said the families would not be deterred in their search for truth and justice.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are shocked and appalled at the arrest of two journalists related to the No Stone Unturned documentary, which exposed the extent of state collusion between the state and loyalist paramilitaries in Loughinisland, she said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe British government have systematically denied and continue to cover up its role in the murder of six people in the Heights Bar.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThese arrests show the lengths of desperation that the British government and state forces are prepared to go to, in order to stifle the truth about what happened in Loughinisland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Police Ombudsman\u0026rsquos report into Loughinisland murders was one of the most damning expositions of state collusion in mass murder ever published.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoOur families, and many other families across the island, some of whom have been denied the basic right to an inquest, have campaigned for many years against state collusion and for truth and justice for our loved ones.\n\nSouth Down Sinn F\u0026eacutein MP Chris Hazzard has thanked those who came out to stand with the Loughinisland families on Friday night.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe arrests of two leading investigative journalists who helped lift the lid on collusion following the 1994 Loughinisland murders through \u0026lsquoNo Stone Unturned\u0026rsquo has re-opened many wounds for the families of those murdered, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThat truth would never have been possible without journalists like Barry and Trevor who acted always with integrity.

The boys stumbled on a giant puff-ball while holidaying at Cargagh Lane, Ballyculter, and since then they have discovered that it makes good eating.\n\nIndeed, they have already munched their way through half of the puff-ball, a perfect example of Calvatia Gigantea, which is very rare.\n\n\u0026ldquoAt first we had no idea what it was, said 14 year-old Michael. \u0026ldquoWe thought it had come from outer space.\n\nSixteen year-old brother Peter said: \u0026ldquoCuriosity forded us to taste it and we have now eaten more than half of it.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt is delicious when you try it in egg and breadcrumbs \u0026mdash it tastes like mushrooms.

He was 80. A native of Ballyronan, Derry, he moved with his family from Belfast to Shrigley after the outbreak of the last war and began his business in Killyleagh Street, Crossgar.\n\nHis conscientiousness at work meant that 12-hour days were common place.

Hopefully this movement will be able to grow and put some pressure on the politicians to get back, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoA lot of people have said that maybe we should do this again and last week I encouraged those in attendance to take photographs and send them to their MLAs to show the support there is for them to get back to work.\n\nJoan said the simple message from last week\u0026rsquos meeting to the politicians was: \u0026ldquoWe elected you, get back to work.\n\nShe added: \u0026ldquoThe politicians are in effect our employees, we elected them to do a job for us and at the minute they are not delivering.

It is something they want to try and address to make the town even more attractive to holidaymakers in particular.\n\nMournes councillor Laura Devlin said that due to the force of nature there was no way of maintaining a sandy beach, which was why s he believed a pop-up beach on top of the promenade was an alternative worth pursuing.\n\nShe believes the move would provide Newcastle with that beachy summer feel and was pleased council officers were to examine if a temporary beach could be provided and the costs involved.\n\n\u0026ldquoTourism is the district\u0026rsquos biggest economic driver so let\u0026rsquos see what more we can do to improve the product we have to offer and provide a new outdoor amenity for people in the resort as well, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Environment Agency has determined, along with other coastal erosion experts, that due to the construction\u0026nbsp\n\nof the promenade, sand is naturally depleted from Newcastle beach and there will never be enough of it to form a usable beach.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, diversity in the church, compassion for the complexities of life and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own life journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by individual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, difficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a return for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully functioning calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots.
