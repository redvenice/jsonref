But a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States had yet to see any appreciable change in Russia\u0027s nuclear posture.As far-reaching Western sanctions on Russian banks and other institutions took hold, the ruble plummeted, and Russia\u0027s Central Bank scrambled to shore it up, as did Putin, signing a decree restricting foreign currency.But that did little to calm Russian fears. In Moscow, people lined up to withdraw cash as the sanctions threatened to drive up prices and reduce the standard of living for millions of ordinary Russians.In yet another blow to Russia\u0027s economy, oil giant Shell said it was pulling out of the country because of the invasion. It announced it will withdraw from its joint ventures with state-owned gas company Gazprom and other entities and end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project between Russia and Europe.The economic sanctions, ordered by the U.S. and other allies, were just one contributor to Russia\u0027s growing status as a pariah country.Russian airliners are banned from European airspace, Russian media is restricted in some countries, and some high-tech products can no longer be exported to the country.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit US Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 57.3 in February, from 55.5 in January and only slightly lower than the ‘flash’ estimate of 57.5.  The headline figure was below the peaks seen in 2021, but signalled a stronger upturn in the health of the manufacturing sector, with sharper output and new order expansions contributing to overall growth.

Here is a round-up of today’s stories: This threatens to push global food prices, which were already surging before the war in Ukraine, even higher. RBI has operated in Russia through its Moscow-based subsidiary since 1996, a few years after the Soviet Union collapsed. That business is one of the biggest banks operating in Russia, the 10th biggest by assets, and contributed almost a third of the Austrian banking group’s net profit of €1.5bn last year. A decision to quit Russia (and Ukraine) is not imminent but could be triggered if RBI’s businesses in those countries need further cash or capital, one of the sources told Reuters. The other source said RBI could exit Russia and Ukraine by handing over ownership to another entity, or temporarily suspend activity. Russia’s prime minister Mikhail Mishustin has said Moscow would temporarily stop foreigners selling assets, complicating any attempts to quit the country. Putin was speaking in January, days after the country’s central bank proposed a blanket ban on cryptocurrency trading and mining. In the case of bitcoin, the cornerstone cryptocurrency, mining is the energy-intensive process by which computers verify new bitcoin transactions – putting them on a virtual ledger known as a blockchain – and generate new bitcoins as a reward for that work. The Bank of Russia was emphatic in its warning, saying that cryptocurrency mining entailed “significant risks for the economy and financial stability.”. One week later, Putin appeared to be less sure, pointing that Russia had advantages in cryptocurrency mining due to its huge energy wealth and expertise in the field. The first round of talks that took place near the Belarus-Ukraine border on Monday ended after about six hours with no breakthrough, but both sides agreed to a follow-up round in the coming days.

More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports.

Photograph: Ben WaddamsIrish scientists have published the first record of a noble false widow spider feeding on bats having ensnared them in their web.It is the first time for any species of false widow spider to be recorded preying on mammals. In this case, its prey was a protected species of pipistrelle bats.The scientists based at the Ryan Institute at NUI Galway said their recording further demonstrates the threat the spider posed in undermining native species.It is the first time a member of this family of spiders – called theridiidae – has been recorded preying on a bat anywhere in the world or on any vertebrate in Britain.The extraordinary discovery was made by wildlife artist Ben Waddams at his home in north Shropshire, England. On two consecutive days, bats living in the attic were found entangled on the spider’s web below the entrance to the roost.The first bat, a young pup, was immobilised with its limbs pinned tightly to the torso with silk. It was slightly shrivelled and discoloured from the spider feeding off the remains.A second, much larger adult bat, was also captured and entangled in the web but as it was still alive, the bat was rescued from the web and released. Such grisly events are not as uncommon as people might expect three years ago the noble false widow spider was reported feeding on a protected species of native lizard in Ireland.Originating from Madeira and the Canary Islands it has the potential to become one of the world’s most invasive species of spider. It was first reported in southern England in 1879 and has increased its range and population density in recent decades, spreading northwards to Scotland and westward through Wales and Ireland.CharacteristicsThe species is known for its medical significance, having the ability to cause a range of mild to severe symptoms in people who are bitten, but little is known about its impact on native species.Over the past five years, a team led by Dr Michel Dugon in NUIG’s venom systems lab, have been studying a wide range of characteristics specific to the species including its venom ecology and behaviour.Dr Dugon said: “We have been working on the noble false widow for the past five years, and have learnt a great deal about this species – yet, we are still surprised by its ability to adapt to new environments and make the most of the resources available. It is a truly remarkable species.”Dr John Dunbar, the lead author of a study published in Ecosphere detailing the case, said: “In more exotic parts of the world, scientists have been documenting such predation events by spiders on small vertebrates for many years, but we are only beginning to realise just how common these events occur. Now that this alien species has become well established in Ireland and Britain, we are witnessing such fascinating events on our very own doorstep.”Even other, much smaller, species of false widows are known to capture and feed on snakes and lizards, he confirmed. “This study presents yet another example of the invasive impact by the noble false widow spider on native species. We know they are much more competitive than native spiders, and this further confirms their impact on prey species.”They possess a fast-acting neurotoxic venom with similar composition to true black widows that can cause neuromuscular paralysis in terrestrial vertebrates, which allows them to occasionally feed on small reptiles and mammals.“False widow spiders, just as their close relatives’ black widow spiders, have extraordinary prey capture techniques and remarkably potent venom, which allows them to capture small vertebrate prey many times larger than the spider itself with surprising ease,” explained researcher Aiste Vitkauskaite, who is based in the lab.The NUIG team are encouraging members of the public to email them at falsewidow@nuigalway.ie to report sightings of the spider."},{"url":null,"title":"kharkiv bombardment represents escalation of russia s tactics","story":"Footage released by the State Emergency Services of Ukraine showed the moment a Russian missile attack struck the regional administration building in Kharkiv, Ukraine\u0027s second-largest city. Video: ReutersThe central square of Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, was shelled by advancing Russian forces who hit a government building. Photograph: Sergey BOBOK  AFPThe artillery barrage that Russia launched on Monday against the city of Kharkiv is a gruesome escalation of the tactics that Moscow has deployed in its five-day attack on Ukraine, and analysts warned it may only be a foretaste of worse to come.Authorities in the eastern city said heavy shelling in residential areas had killed and wounded civilians. Televised footage shared widely on social media showed a barrage of strikes around apartment blocks, with multiple flashes of explosions and plumes of smoke rising from buildings.The onslaught came after Ukrainian troops repelled a Russian incursion into the city on Sunday and followed intensive exchanges on the city’s outskirts a day earlier, according to the UK defence ministry. Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, is a key Russian military objective, along with the capital Kyiv.A senior US defence official said Russia was trying to encircle Kharkiv, a city of 1.4 million inhabitants, and was using long-range fire in its efforts to take control there. “We do believe their plans are to encircle the city and to try to take it that way because that has really been where the heaviest fighting’s been,” said the official.Pentagon officials said there were growing signs that Vladimir Putin’s forces were taking the same tack with Kyiv. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said on Monday that the country was braced for a crucial 24 hours, as Russian troops stepped up their efforts to encircle the capital.“We’re starting to see the same sort of approach being applied to Kyiv,” said the official, adding that Russian forces had advanced about 5km over the past 24 hours and were now within 25km of the city centre.The US official also said there were growing concerns that Russia’s frustration at the slow pace of its military assault on Ukraine could prompt it to use heavier bombing and missile attacks.EscalationAnalysts said they feared that the escalation of force recalled the early stages of Russia’s levelling of Grozny in 1999. One of Putin’s first acts as president was a bombardment of the Chechen city as part of a war on Islamist separatists that left much of the city in ruins and killed up to 8,000 civilians.“Today’s pictures from Kharkiv certainly look like the beginnings of ‘Groznification’,” said Eliot Cohen, a professor at The Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.Despite Putin’s claims that he wanted to “liberate” Ukraine, Kharkiv lies in a Russian-speaking area of Ukraine, just 40km from the border. “Of course, Grozny was a Russian city too, but that didn’t stop Putin,” Cohen added.In a sign of what may be to come, other videos shared on social media showed Russian SU-34 fighter-bombers flying over the city.Olga, a Kharkiv resident who spoke to the Financial Times by phone, said she saw the rocket strikes while out buying groceries in the north-west of the city. The shelling intensified “and then the shrapnel started flying. We thought they shot a plane down”, she said. “It was deafening.”ArtilleryAnalysts said the use of artillery barrages represents a Russian return to tried-and-tested military tactics after its advance in northern and eastern Ukraine bogged down after the failure of what Russian analysts described as an initial softly-softly approach.“The instructions from the Kremlin were to reduce Ukrainian cities to rubble while liberating them,” said Pavel Felgenhauer, a Russian military expert.But stronger than expected resistance incurred Russian casualties – as many as 4,500 according to Ukrainian authorities – and caused heavier than expected losses of tanks and other equipment. Russia has not provided a figure for the number of its personnel killed and injured.Ukrainian and Russian military claims cannot be independently verified.Analysts and officials have been warning that Russia’s setbacks, while spurring Ukrainian resistance, increased the chance of heavy bombardment and possibly assaults using thermobaric weapons, which use oxygen from the surrounding air to generate an intense, high-temperature explosion.Social media posts on Monday also appeared to show TOS-1 heavy flame throwers positioned outside the besieged southern city of Mariupol. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"this is a mess anxious russians grab cash and plot emigration","story":"Moscow: Some people lined up for hours waiting for dollars to arrive at a branch or ATM, only for the machine to be emptied within minutes. Photograph: Andrey RudakovBloombergFive days into Russia’s conflict with Ukraine, events are moving so fast that Illarion, a 37-year-old Muscovite programmer, has decided he needs to be prepared for the worst – having to flee the country.“A few days ago we were all saying, of course there won’t be any war. Then the war happened. Then we were saying there won’t be a nuclear war, we won’t have to flee the country,” said Illarion, one of hundreds of people standing in line at cash machines across Russia’s capital.Large queues have formed as residents search for US dollars, which are increasingly scarce after the west imposed financial sanctions on Russia that limit its access to foreign currency.Some people lined up for hours waiting for dollars to arrive at a branch or ATM, only for the machine to be emptied within minutes. Others even tried to track cash trucks around the city, they told the Financial Times. Anxiety was only heightened by Russian president Vladimir Putin’s move on Sunday to put his nuclear forces on high alert.“We are now wondering whether the state is going to forcefully convert dollar savings into roubles to take the citizens’ dollars because they are being cut off from the outside. That is a reality we see on the horizon,” said Illarion. “I don’t think it is a joke any more that we may have bombs flying at us and we’ll need to flee the country, which requires having dollars in cash or cryptocurrency.”The Russian rouble fell more than 30 per cent at the start of trade on Monday against the dollar after the US and the EU imposed sanctions on its central bank and cut access to the Swift payments system for some of the country’s banks.Moscow then announced a ban from Tuesday on foreign currency transfers to banks outside the country.More Russians even appear to be considering leaving the country. The search for the word “emigration” has increased fivefold last week, according to Google trends, which analyses the frequency of online searches. Most of the searches come from Murmansk and St Petersburg, a traditionally liberal city, followed by Moscow.Lev Gudkov, the head of independent polling centre Levada, told Kommersant FM radio that the number of people willing to leave the country had increased significantly in February, reaching 22 per cent of Russians and to nearly half among the young.Reasons include limited business opportunities, the “increasingly repressive regime” and anxiety among parents of children approaching conscription age, he said. “Whoever had been in two minds, will now be persuaded to leave as the iron curtain rolls down.”Some have compared the situation to the communist era, when the Soviet Union was in effect shut off from the rest of the world. Others expect a repeat of the 1990s, when a collapse in the value of the currency pushed up the cost of living.“I recall in the 1990s prices were set in dollars, even if it was illegal. The rouble was worthless. And I worry this is what we will see again,” said Alexei, an IT specialist, who had been waiting for several hours at a mall where he exchanged roubles into dollars at the record rate of more than Rbs100 per dollar. Before the war, a dollar bought Rbs70. He too said he was looking for ways to emigrate.Elena, a 29-year-old human resources specialist from Moscow, said she is thinking of following friends who left for the United Arab Emirates before the current crisis as they could not see a positive future in Russia.“We really hope the situation can be resolved with minimal losses, but knowing the policy of our country and where it is headed, I am not positive about the prospects . . . I’m starting to think I’ll be of more use even to my own family, my parents, by being out of here.”Others have lined up to buy iPhones and televisions, spending roubles now in the expectation that their value will continue to fall.In the face of profound uncertainty, Illarion is one of those ready for all eventualities. “I have rouble savings in case everything will be okay, and dollar savings in case things are not okay,” he said. “Anything that previously seemed impossible we have to have a plan for.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Authors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsAbout 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"smouldering ruins childrens clothes shop signs russian desperation","story":"For five fear-filled days, residents of Kharkiv have listened to the rockets slamming into the fringes of their city and prayed that at least civilian areas would be spared. But on Monday, at about midday, the moment they had been dreading arrived. At least 11 people were killed in rocket strikes in residential areas of Kharkiv as both sides readied for a major battle over Ukraine\u0027s second largest city. The city council said 15 soldiers and 16 civilians were hospitalised, and that numbers of both dead and wounded were likely to rise. Interior Minister adviser Anton Herashchenko said \u0027dozens\u0027 had been killed. As usual, it was Telegram social media channels that brought the news. Images and videos posted by local residents showed the rapid thudda-thudda-thudda of multiple rockets raining down on residential buildings in a northern neighbourhood of the city.Grey clouds and clusters of explosions could be seen as the missiles exploded in a pattern of multiple rocket launch-systems. Then came the close-ups of the aftermath. The smouldering ruins of a children’s clothes shop. Cars aflame in a residential block. A man sitting lifeless at the wheel of his shrapnel-holed Hyundai sedan, the airbag stained with blood from his head. Two men lying dead in the street.And an elderly woman and her severed leg, cut off by a rocket that came crashing through the window of her apartment. She died soon afterwards. This was not the first time Russia has targeted civilians in Kharkiv. Cannon shells and rockets have been slamming intermittently into the tall concrete apartment buildings in Saltivka, a working-class suburb overlooking the eastern ring road, since day one of the invasion. On Saturday night, a woman and her daughter posted a sarcastic “thank you” video to Vladimir Putin in front of their burning cottage after it was hit by shelling. “It’s just what we wanted. You’re a real Tsar and God,” they said, mocking his claim to be protecting ethnic Russians. City authorities said on Monday evening that 87 homes and apartment blocks had been destroyed since the fighting began. But on the whole, the huge Russian army sitting just outside the city has not explicitly or indiscriminately targeted civilians. Some of their operations - including a puzzling and ultimately disastrous assault by unsupported troops in light vehicles on Sunday - seem to have assumed that the local population would be supportive, and that therefore it would be wise not to alienate them.  Those tactics have so far failed to deliver, and many are reading it a deliberate signal of a change to more ruthless tactics.American intelligence officials said a few hours after the strike that Russia was now seeking to encircle the city and were employing siege tactics including “long-range fires”.The current belief is that if they can get Kharkiv and then get Mariupol, if you draw the line between those two cities, you can see that that would allow them to section off the eastern part of Ukraine,” said a senior US defence official. That could mean the kind of unrestrained violence unleashed on Grozny in the 2000s and in Aleppo in 2016. It is a prospect many in this Russian-speaking city would find unthinkable. But the Kremlin is showing growing signs of frustration in its failure to take not only Kyiv, but any other major city, and preparations are clearly underway for a more concerted assault.  Large quantities of artillery, including a TOS-1 thermobaric rocket launcher, have been seen moving south from Belgorod to the Kharkiv front in recent days. Fighter jets were seen over the city on Monday. For all its horror and criminality, Monday\u0027s attack was not sustained - it may have been a demonstration of what could be in store if resistance continues, rather than an all-out assault.  In many other neighbourhoods of this large city, life carried on - in a subdued, frightened way - as normally as possible. “We’re fine, it wasn’t anywhere near us. It’s just as usual as it has been around here,” said a resident of another eastern suburb heavily affected by fighting and shelling the previous day. “But they have totally done in our school. And looting is becoming a problem. When it started everyone went shopping and stocked up, but now those reserves are running out.”He was sceptical about the dangers of a siege. They\u0027re not going to turn this city into Grozny. They don\u0027t need that, he said, pointing out the only shells that had fallen near his house appeared to be strays. The charred remains of School Number 234, which burnt to the ground on Sunday night, have become another much-circulated symbol of the battle of Kharkiv. Some sources said it had been damaged by shelling. But the witness, who lives nearby, said it was destroyed in a gun fight after Russian soldiers who took part in Sunday’s botched attempt to storm the city holed up in the building to make their last stand. It wasn’t clear if any of them survived the battle, and troops across the city remained on high alert for any survivors who may have managed to escape capture.  If the battle for Kharkiv becomes a full-scale siege, many more buildings will burn and hundreds, if not thousands, of civilians may die. \u0027Some attacks could be war crimes\u0027Ukrainian officials initially blamed Grads, the work-horse of Russia’s indiscriminate and devastating rocket artillery units. Others insisted it was a “cluster munitions”, probably deployed by Smerch or Uragan rockets that open up to distribute sub munitions while in flight - as if that constituted some kind of special war crime. Russia has certainly used those already in Kharkiv, including in an attack on a civilian blood donation centre on Friday. We know because the blast patterns - which look like miniature mortar craters - are unmistakable, and because the empty container sections of the rockets used crash to earth about a kilometre beyond the target. They have shown up embedded in roads, gardens and playgrounds across the city. But the distinction is academic. Both weapons are indiscriminate, inaccurate, and designed to kill and maim huge numbers of people over wide areas. Amnesty International said on Friday that the Russian military had shown “blatant disregard for civilian lives by using ballistic missiles and other explosive weapons with wide area effects in densely populated areas” and that “some of these attacks may be war crimes”.Whatever happens, Kharkiv is a city readying for disaster. The last train to Poltava, crowded with people desperate to leave, was unable to leave because of shelling on Monday morning. The driver ordered women and children to lie on carriage floors. On the roads out of town, the  witnessed long queues forming at supermarkets and bank machines in Kharkiv in the morning. The  witnessed large numbers of Ukrainian troops and heavy supply lorries rolled up the still-open highways from the south and west.  The battle here may only be beginning. Listen to Roland Oliphant reporting on Chopper\u0027s Politics, The \u0027s weekly political podcast, using the audio player below or on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or your favourite podcast app.More from NewsLatest pictures from Ukraine: Fighting intensifies as Russian column bears down on KyivRussia-Ukraine latest news: \u0026#39Leave your homes\u0026#39, Kremlin warns as Kyiv TV tower hitPancake Day 2022: The perfect mix, alternative toppings and how to avoid a flipping disasterSNP president condemned for ‘crass’ comparison of Ukraine and Scottish independenceNational Offer Day 2022: Uptick in pupils getting first choice of secondary school in EnglandWe will not fight Russian forces in Ukraine, insists Boris JohnsonMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"west sleepwalking even devastating conflict russia","story":"As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine intensifies, the West watches from the sidelines, rooting for a Hollywood ending. That may happen yet. The Ukrainian underdog has put up spirited resistance against a retrograde Russian military machine and President Zelensky – immortalised by the epic phrase “I need ammunition, not a ride”– has become an icon of sovereignty and freedom. The free world has been shamed into matching his heroism, ramping up sanctions and sending weapons. Its action against Russia’s central bank may be a gamechanger, potentially draining Vladimir Putin’s war chest by two thirds.Although Putin has insisted that Russia will never again see revolution, having reached its psychological “limit” for such “cataclysms”, a popular domestic revolt should not be discounted. As the economy goes into freefall, the country’s celebrities are slamming Putin’s war on Instagram. Other elite Russians – from banking tycoons to diplomats – have stuck their necks out, too, to denounce the invasion. Rumours have swirled about the wavering loyalty of members of Putin’s inner circle, including foreign minister Sergei Lavrov.  Still, it may be Xi Jinping who emerges the unlikely anti-hero, compelled to finally twist the knife. Although both China and Russia are united in their hostility to the West, the CCP believes that time is on its side. It is committed to a different gameplan – steadily bending the rules of the liberal order until it breaks, rather than smashing it outright. Beijing has so far refused to openly help Russia to bypass economic sanctions comprehensively. As Putin’s actions become more unhinged and ruthless, Xi may well double-cross the Kremlin.A Ukrainian victory would be a stunning triumph for freedom over tyranny, and show that there is life in Western values yet. Let us hope that it comes to pass. None the less, we ought to consider less positive scenarios. The first is that Putin’s military operation in Ukraine is eventually successful, albeit at astonishing cost. The Kremlin has so far committed considerably less than the full range of forces at its disposal and, despite its evident deficiencies, the Russian military retains an overwhelming combat advantage. Yesterday, we also saw the first indications of what civilians can expect in the coming days: relentless artillery and missile strikes and devastating loss of life. If Putin grows more frustrated with his lack of a tactical breakthrough, he may decide to flatten Ukraine’s resistance as he did the Syrian rebels – including, some have speculated, via the use of chemical or small nuclear weapons. A Russian victory would mark the dawn of a new world order. One in which the glory of empire rivals the sanctity of sovereignty, and sinister ideas of ethnic kinship threaten to usurp modern concepts of nationhood. Pandora’s box would be opened, emboldening China to make a bid for Taiwan and Turkey to formally take chunks out of Iraq and Cyprus. Africa faces balkanisation, as countries erupt into civil war. In an opinion column that has gone viral in China, the social media commentator Zhanhao chillingly asserts: “Many countries will disappear in the coming decades, the inevitable result of unprecedented changes this century... Now it’s alright. There is no medicine for regret. Times have changed.”Such a world would not only be feverish with conflict and empire-building, but ided along new Cold War lines. At best, Ukraine would be “Finlandised”, accepting neutral status, like Helsinki during the Cold War, in return for semi-independence. At worst, it could be partially or wholly absorbed into a Greater Russia. Russia and China would forge closer economic and geopolitical links. Xi has already eased trade restrictions and agreed to increase energy imports from Moscow. Both sides have discussed creating a financial infrastructure to rival Swift. Today, Beijing and Moscow’s mutual solidarity against the West remains largely rhetorical. It could metastasise into a malignant alliance, with the two sides joining forces, on everything from cyberwarfare to the AI arms race.This would be a shock from which the Western world would struggle to recover. But there is an even more catastrophic scenario. One that, at present, remains extremely unlikely, but which cannot be dismissed as impossible either: a direct conflict between Russia and the West. The Kremlin has already raised the temperature. Putin – who may not be of sound mind – not only put his nuclear forces on high alert at the weekend but has radically altered the rules of nuclear war over recent years, by rewriting Russia’s deterrence doctrine. This document asserts that a nuclear war is winnable for Russia, and lowered the bar for deploying atomic weapons, allowing them to be used against non-nuclear strikes.Western politicians, meanwhile, too often treat statesmanship like a social media popularity contest with little thought to the strategic implications of their actions. It is one thing sending defensive armaments to Kyiv, in an attempt to stiffen the Ukrainians’ resolve. It is quite another promising to send fighter jets that might be deemed by Russia to have an offensive purpose, or constitute a declaration of proxy war – as the EU did at the weekend. There is thus the non-negligible risk war might erupt by accident. We also underestimate at our peril the extent to which Ukraine may be a do-or-die issue for Putin. In the mind of Russia’s dictator, empire and survival are one and the same. Convinced that Moscow’s nuclear arsenal is the only thing that has prevented the West from attempting Iraq-style regime change, he is adamant that great power status is the only way that Russia can avoid domination by the West. By his gnarled logic, Ukraine is the key, for which he is willing to risk everything. A Russia without it is doomed to oblivion – diminished, encircled by enemies and slowly strangled by the kind of economic sanctions that the West does not dare level on China. If he thinks victory in Ukraine demands direct action against Kyiv’s allies, can we be sure that he wouldn’t take it?Putin’s nihilistic fanaticism, in short, could alter the course of history not just for Ukraine but the world. The West must urgently respond with less romanticism and more realism.  More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: \u0026#39Leave your homes\u0026#39, Kremlin warns as Kyiv TV tower hitLatest pictures from Ukraine: Fighting intensifies as Russian column bears down on KyivPancake Day 2022: The perfect mix, alternative toppings and how to avoid a flipping disasterSNP president condemned for ‘crass’ comparison of Ukraine and Scottish independenceNational Offer Day 2022: Uptick in pupils getting first choice of secondary school in EnglandWe will not fight Russian forces in Ukraine, insists Boris JohnsonMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mi6s business intelligence not lgbt rights","story":"‘With the tragedy and destruction unfolding so distressingly in Ukraine, we should remember the values and hard won freedoms that distinguish us from Putin, none more than LGBT+ rights. So let’s resume our series of tweets to mark #LGBTHM2022.” Thus tweeted Richard Moore, the head of MI6, the day after Russia invaded Ukraine.Mr Moore is right that one of Putin’s many repulsive aspects is his persecution of gay people. But it is not true to state that LGBT+ rights stand at the pinnacle of all the freedoms that make us different from Putin’s Russia.The central point about Western freedom is that it is a condition of all living. It cannot be boiled down to sexuality, sex, race, region, age, religion etc: it is not a list of specific rights granted to designated minorities, but freedom for everyone.It follows that the most important defences of freedom are general too – the rule of law, habeas corpus, parliamentary democracy, freedom of speech. It is a serious mistake to exalt group rights over the rights of each person.Mr Moore’s tweet trivialises the evil that Putin embodies – a tyranny attacking all human dignity and all human choice. In this time of extreme crisis, “C” should not be counselling his staff to spend any time at all on LGBT+ “History Month”, or any History Month whatever.“C”s tweet is unwise for another reason. The head of MI6, even now that he is publicly “avowed”, should not use his position to make moralpolitical assertions. In our free society, his job should be much more focused than that. His task is to lead the agency that supplies our Government with secret intelligence about threats posed by foreign powers and international terrorist networks, and personally to advise the Prime Minister on such matters.Vauxhall Cross is the headquarters of Britain’s intelligence professionals, not Mr Moore’s pulpit.Fighting each other My friend and country neighbour, Natasha Poliakov, is a very Russian Russian. She fulfils the caricature of what we like about Russians. She is full of fun, life and passion, and is brave to the point of lunacy. Although she has lived in Britain for many years, and has always detested the regime of Vladimir Putin, and although her ancestors were quickly murdered by the Bolsheviks in the revolution, she has a deep faith in her country.A couple of weeks ago, we had an argument. I was saying how worried I was by Putin’s belligerence. She declared that, despite his threats, Putin would not attack Ukraine: “I am absolutely sure that we Russians will never fight our own people.”I saw her again last Saturday. She was distraught: “I had thought we were part of civilised society.” She had been particularly struck by the news story of Vitaly Shakun, a Ukrainian soldier who had deliberately encompassed his own death by blowing up a bridge to stop the advance of Russian tanks in the Kherson region last week.It reminded her, she told me, of the heroic tale of Alexander Matrosov, on which she had been brought up in the Soviet era. In 1942, Matrosov, a 19-year-old Ukrainian private in the Red Army, helped attack a German heavy machine-gun emplaced in a concrete pillbox to block entry to a village.When other methods failed, Matrosov climbed up the face of the pillbox and forced his body into the slot from which the machine gun was firing, thus blocking it. He died, of course, but his action allowed his comrades to rush forward and capture the position. For this heroism, Stalin renamed his regiment after him.“I thought such a thing would never be repeated,” said Natasha, “but now our president has forced a situation in which, to liberate one, you have to kill the other.” He had made the peoples who fought Hitler together fight each other. She has decided, she told me, to go to the Russian embassy and resign her citizenship.The trouble with modern landlinesIn the wake of the lengthy power cuts caused by Storm Eunice (see last Tuesday’s column), readers are writing in to lament the loss of landlines. For 20 years, a project called BT 21 has been removing copper wire phone lines to homes and replacing them with fibre-optic cables. The change greatly improves broadband capacity, but there is a side effect.Unless you have the good fortune, as we do, to live in a backward rural area, you will have found, during the power cuts, that none of your phone lines worked. The old copper wire meant that landline phones (unless on portable extensions) were unaffected by power cuts. All new phones rely on electricity. By 2026 or so, even if you still have copper wire, BT will have migrated calls to Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP), so no call can be made without electricity.A power cut therefore becomes much more serious. Someone working from home can be completely cut off, with no Wi-Fi. A person who is too old, too cold or injured, and is out of mobile phone power, cannot even make an emergency call. BT has always been coy about this.Is there a solution? Only a car-charger, a spare, charged battery for your mobile, or your own generator. Most of us will be completely vulnerable to a national grid which, in the age of Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, could be disrupted by cyber-attack. Such are the paradoxes of progress.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: \u0026#39Leave your homes\u0026#39, Kremlin warns as Kyiv TV tower hitLatest pictures from Ukraine: Fighting intensifies as Russian column bears down on KyivPancake Day 2022: The perfect mix, alternative toppings and how to avoid a flipping disasterSNP president condemned for ‘crass’ comparison of Ukraine and Scottish independenceNational Offer Day 2022: Uptick in pupils getting first choice of secondary school in EnglandWe will not fight Russian forces in Ukraine, insists Boris JohnsonMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"national offer day 2022 uptick pupils getting first choice secondary","story":"School places under pressurePaul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders\u0027 union NAHT, said: This can be an anxious time for families.Choosing the right school and securing a place there is a huge moment in a child\u0027s life, and not everyone will get their first choice today.

Observers went home afterwards, while the troops lived in the fallout at Christmas Island for up to a year Image: MirrorpixopinionByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  Feb |commentsSeventy years ago this October, Britain detonated its first atomic bomb. The  further nuclear weapon trials ious governments conducted over decades are the reason why, today, Vladimir Putin probably isnapost going to irradiate the UK by teatime. And for the past  years, the servicemen who delivered our nuclear deterrent have been saying they got cancer as a result. That their wives miscarried repeatedly. That children were born with defects - deformities, poor plumbing, extra teeth.To every complaint, each government said the same: there is no evidence. Until Thursday morning, when, just as Putin rolled his tanks into Ukraine, officials published an update to a government study into the health of the nuclear test veterans.  Read the full story of Britainaposs nuclear tests at DAMNED And for the first time it said they were right. They are more likely to die and get cancer. Seven decades after developing a weapon always intended to be physically and genetically devastating to any living thing exposed to it, government scientists admitted that a long-term detrimental health effect associated with participation in the tests cannot be completely ruled out.It took a day to digest the -page report, packed with statistical tables, but the figure which jumped out was that test veterans were . times more likely to die from chronic myeloid leukaemia, a type of bone cancer that, the report says, is radiation-inducible. A further  pages of supplementary material establishes % of the crew of HMS Diana, a warship ordered twice to sail through fallout, had died, almost all from tumours. They show that RAF ground crew who washed down planes that had flown through the mushroom clouds were  times more likely to die from leukaemia. Read moreAnd, perhaps most devastatingly for all those governments which twisted reality and logic to deny these men the truth, suicide rates were excessive in every single decade since the tests began. But something wasnapost right. \" target\"_self\" rel\"nofollow\"This study began in , with updates in  and . They backed up the government line to such an extent veterans called them a cover-up and whitewash. The new one was ordered in , after the Mirror launched a medal campaign. The authors say the extra  years made it possible to study in more detail and with greater statistical certainty the potential lelong health impact of test participation. Yet on page , the report compares all this extra information with studies from before : reports which do not have that detail. How was it possible, we asked the researchers, to compare, when this is the first time weaposve seen it  We were told that the previous three reports were summary papers, and published alongside them at the same time were companion reports with extra data. Veterans, families, campaigners, lawyers, and war pension advocates were amazed. This was the first time they had been told the first  studies were summaries, and that there was anything extra. We asked when and where these companion reports were published. We were told they all have ISBN numbers, and were available from government agencies. And they were mentioned in the summaries.With the latest study, all  have now been put online. So we had a look at the first, which was only ever available previously in paper format. It was  pages long, and published in the British Medical Journal on January , . Nowhere within it does it state that there is extra detail in a companion report.What there is, is a footnote. It could be identied as the right reference only because it mentions a code also used on the front page of the companion report. This report could be found onlyyou already had it. This footnote is referenced in the paper just twice, and says merely that the companion report describes methodology and verication checks. There is no mention, whatsoever, of it containing DATA . But this extra information is eye-opening. Spread across  pages, it shows test veterans are . times more likely to die from leukaemia, . times more likely to die from bladder cancer, and raised rates of suicide. And thereaposs a table showing  test veterans dead from chronic myeloid leukaemia, compared to none in the control group, a statistically-signicant figure with a low rate of probability, which means men at the nuclear tests were  TIMES more likely to get a radiation-inducible bone cancer than anyone  in the population.A call to the Stationery Office established that not one copy of this companion report had even been published, not once in  years.  It is entirely possible, therefore, that you are one of the first people in the world to ever see what the British state has known for most of your le: that men ordered to take part in experiments weaponising radiation were more likely to die as a result.Despite knowing that, the state fought every war pension claim and court case. It issued denials to every Daily Mirror story. It sent ministers to the Despatch Box to say there was no evidence. It did it all using millions of pounds of taxpayersapos money - your money.Thousands of test veterans have died, uncompensated and unrecognised, because no-one told them about the companion reports. Hundreds of thousands of children have been born to parents who ask a doctor why, and the doctor just shrugs, because this data was hidden in the footnotes. Decades have rolled slowly by while whole families of men who served their country went in and out of hospital, lost jobs, lost faith, and grieved for those who took their own lives. Ministers were briefed by advisers, who read the reportaposs front page which blames smoking and says that, overall there was no detectable effect on health from the tests. Editors and defence reporters in a once-angry media listened to briefings from the MoD, and shrugged the story away. Read more Even veterans and lawyers, who pored over these documents, had no reason to think there was proof within them that radiation-linked bone cancer could be linked to explosions of plutonium isotopes that have been considered toxic and bone-seeking almost since their discovery. Yet here it is, hidden in the open, unpublished but publishable, something that has never existed in physical form and which can be seen only to those whoaposve seen it already. It takes a special level of deviousness to cover something up while at the same time covering your own arse to effectively hide something in a microdot, so that you can always say it was published at the time.It could be argued that the passage of time has made the test veteran data clearer, and the figures worse. As some of these illnesses are more common with age, there is a clearer comparison with the control group. But it is indisputable that at least those  men who died from radiogenic bone cancer within  years of the tests could have had a war pension from the moment they fell ill. Their widows,they were married, could have had a pension too they could have had faith. Instead they were denied even a medal by a state which puts itself above the people it serves.It would have cost us two things: a fraction of the money spent fighting the veterans, and the pride of an Establishment which is simply unable to admit it ever did wrong. Both would have been worth paying, and weaposd have a finer country for it. One which, perhaps, that would never have let a despot who puts radiation in a pot of tea be in a position to invade anywhere.

The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman said: “I would say that would we would expect restraint on matters like this given current circumstances but beyond that I think it is right that we let IPSA set out the proposals as an independent body.”  Askedthe PM wouldn’t accept a pay rise himself, the spokesman replied: “I’m simply saying they haven’t set out any detail yet so I wouldn’t wish to comment while that independent process is taking place. “Beyond that we would expect to see restraint on these issues.”Richard Lloyd, IPSA’s Chair, said: “This is the first increase in pay for MPs in two years and follows the average of increases across the public sector last year. MPs play a vital role in our democracy and this is reflected in their pay. He added: It is right that MPs are paid fairly for the responsibility and the unseen work they do helping their constituents, which dramatically increased last year. For Parliament to reflect society, it is vital that people from all walks of le can be an MP.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON IspaNational Insurance Company Ltd.Richard LloydBoris JohnsonEnergy billsPublic sector workersPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ukraine will prove the fatal, final mistake by a fascistic gangster who egotistically believed his own invincible propaganda after strategic triumphs in Crimea and Syria, and the  Trump and Brexit blows delivered to the US and UK. Vlad the Invader’s twitchy finger on the nuclear trigger and the offer of Potemkin negotiations are both signs even he fears this is an impending personal Armageddon. This is fuelled by brave Ukrainians fighting heroically and Russians courageously protesting “No to War”, which is inspiring resistance around the world. Supplying anti-tank, helicopter and aircraft missiles strengthens defenders and weakens attackers already suffering punishing losses. Britain, the rest of Europe and the US finally uniting over economic and cultural sanctions will eventually bankrupt the Putin machine and perhaps drive a deep wedge between the tyrant and his billionaire cronies who enjoy opulent luxury wherever they please.  And China abstaining instead of vetoing a UN Security Council motion by the US condemning the brutal invasion emphasised Putin’s isolation, as a new ally quickly distanced itself from an ageing, deranged dictator. The bloody conflict could still belong: reducing Ukrainian neighbourhoods to rubble, inflicting unbearable heartache and costing countless lives. What is becoming clearer, however, is that Putin is also likely to be one of the victims. But let’s not buy charlatan Boris Johnson’s propaganda that he is suddenly an international statesman, a Prime Minister orchestrating the resistance. Johnson let Putin walk all over him and Britain, with oligarchs smirking unconcerned whenever ruling Conservatives, reliant on Russian-linked money, talked tough then acted soft.Charismatic, cool-headed, defiant Ukrainian Volodymyr Zelensky is what a real leader looks and sounds like. Germany’s centre-Left Olaf Scholz is also rising to the occasion, standing up to Putin at considerable financial expense. A European Union that Johnson ripped Britain from as part of a career move was firmer on sanctions until shamed Johnson started running to catch up. Locking out Ukrainian refugees fleeing terror unless they apply to be fruit pickers is disgraceful and inhuman, when Poland, Romania and Hungary open their borders. Why not seize the spacious British properties of Russian oligarchs to house Putin’s casualties  I’ve watched and known Johnson for longer than the  years Putin has misruled Russia. So I’m aware of the cynicism of the great charlatan. From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times. The newsletter is sent out twice daily with the latest UK  world politics news, along with leading opinion and analysis.You can sign up here.  The first casualty of war is Partygate, with Johnson relieved that the shells and missiles are effectively providing a smokescreen. If he’s hit by a fine, the PM will pray it is today. Now wouldn’t be the moment to remove a lawbreaker in Downing Street, his apologists will argue. They’d be wrong, of course. Chamberlain was dumped by MPs to be replaced by Churchill during the Second World War then, before Japan finally surrendered, the country swapped Churchill for Attlee. Labour leader Keir Starmer will inevitably receive less airtime than the PM but should have calculated that he must be constructively critical rather than mercilessly pummelling the Tory rogue. War in Europe might save Johnsonnot an invaded country or Putin.

But in truth, many women with kids struggle to balance the enormous expectations on them to be “perfect” in every way. While mums have always been under pressure to do the right thing in every situation with the kids, some argue that social media has made things worse. A trend of “mum shaming” has emerged on s like TikTok, where some people share their parenting successes, without mentioning the negatives of being a parent. In turn, trolls who comment on videos and photos of mums and dads just doing their best can accuse them of being bad parents - despite not knowing them at all. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here One mum from Aberdeenshire has had enough of being made to feel like she’s not doing enough for her kids - and she’s taking a stand. Natalie Sutherland, , is a mum-of-two who runs a business with her husband Marcus. She admits she isn’t “perfect” and says she has a more relaxed approach to being a mum than some people, but it works for her. She first joined TikTok during lockdown when her -year-old daughter Lucy pestered her for an account. “I won’t allow Lucy to have her own TikTok account,” Natalie told The Mirror.  “It’s one of my rules. I have a relaxed parenting style but when it comes to social media I’m very strict.” To make sure Lucy wasn’t missing out, Natalie made a joint account for the two of them so they could make silly videos and pass the time. But when Natalie started to explore the , she saw examples of mum shaming that made her angry. “It’s a joke in our household that I’m not a ‘mumsy’ mum,” she said. “I feel like you’ve got to perform as this sort of perfect mum. That image that you should be in the playground group chats and be part of that culture.“Going to the school discos and being into arts and crafts - it doesn’t come naturally to me.” Natalie, who has always worked full-time while raising her kids, said she felt “guilty” as a younger mum when Lucy was little. “She was in nursery every day from - while I worked,” Natalie explained. “I felt like a failure because I didn’t spend that much time with her during the week, but the weekends were always set aside for our special time together.” Now also mum to Callan, four, Natalie is much more confident in her parenting style while also running her business, Sweet Tooth oapos Mine - and she’s using TikTok to show others like her that they’re great mums too. She said: “I’d seen some things on TikTok and I thought, ‘hang on, there are other mums like me’. But you never find them in the playground.” Soon, Natalie began making her own TikTok videos to show her le as a “real mum” - who doesn’t always get it right, but loves her kids just as much as any other parent. In her videos, which she posts under the #sh*tmum hashtag, she shares the “real” aspects of parenthood, including times when her kids drive her mad and she needs some time alone - as well as living in a sh*thole because the kids make a mess. She talks about the dficulties of getting everything done as a working mum when people are pulling you in all directions. In one video, she writes: “Where are all my mums at who: Have washing built up like Mount Washmore, frantically search for clean clothes for your kids every morning, don’t like being a mum all the time, let their kids make their own breakfast, survive on - hours’ sleep, don’t talk to mums at school because they are another kind of mum to you, snaps at everyone in the house and then cries about it at night.” She has also made confessions about her parenting style that she says you won’t hear from other mums - including making the kids do the dishwasher “because I can’t be arsed and want a coffee” and sometimes forgetting to brush her son’s teeth before bedtime.  In another video, Natalie jokes she sometimes pretends to go upstairs to put her pyjamas on but hides up there for an hour of quiet time, leaving Marcus to occupy the children. Since sharing her honest account of motherhood on TikTok, Natalie says she’s received overwhelming support from other mums, and some dads, who also feel immense pressure to be perfect. “It’s quite nice to be relatable,” she said. “There’s a place for every kind of mum. I’m not shaming any other types of mum, but when you get pregnant, you become ‘mum’ and have to conform to this whole new personality.” As part of her more relaxed approach to parenting, Natalie encourages her kids to do things for themselves - evenit makes her feel a bit guilty. She described feeling victorious when she managed to finish all the laundry in the basket one day - before Lucy dropped her three-day-old dirty football kit into the pile.  “I said to her, ‘That’s fine, you’ve been lazy, so you can wash it yourself’. I know I’ll feel guilty watching her do that but it’s really important we teach our kids these little things. “There’s no shame in kids helping their parents out.” Natalie also posts about the dficulties of raising Callan, who she believes is on the autistic spectrum. Describing how he has to stick to a strict routine every day, she said sometimes she will let her son eat what he wants or give him extra screen timeit keeps him calm. Callan’s condition has thrown up some challenges for Natalie as a mum - but she’s honest about how dficult it can be. “I’m not a very organised person, I’ve always been a scatterbrain. I’m always running late,” she said. She added it can be “exhausting” to keep things as organised as possible in order to keep Callan feeling comfortable. As Natalie continues to share her “real motherhood” journey on TikTok, she hopes she can be a comfort to other parents who feel like they’re not meeting the high standards set for them. “It can lead to mums having real mental health problems and burnout, asthey’re not good enough.” She added: “We’ve been told we have to do everything for our kids or we’re not good parents. They need to learn to do things for themselves.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON PregnancyMental healthParenting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Even UK holidaymakers were asked to help catch fraudster Sarah Panitzke, , from Fulford near York in a recent appeal for information on the whereabouts of fugitive killers, sex attackers and drug traffickers. Panitzkeaposs more than eight years on the run were said to have reached their end after she was arrested by Civil Guard and sent to to a prison near Madrid ahead of her expected extradition. Respected Spanish news website El Confidencial, which broke news of the arrest, said privately-educated Panitzke was fighting her forcedto the UK. Panitzke was included on the list of Britain’s most wanted fugitives after absconding in May  before the end of her trial as a senior member of a crime group involved in VAT fraud.  She was sentenced in her absence to eight years in jail on August  , with  members of the crime group receiving sentences totalling  years. Police said in an appeal in August  she was responsible for laundering approximately one billion pounds. For a long period of time she was the only woman on the National Crime Agency’s Most Wanted List. There has not yet been any official comment from the Civil Guard in Catalonia to the reports about her arrest there in north east Spain. She is said to have been held yesterday at a gated residential estate in the coastal town of Vilanova i la Geltru a -minute drive south of Barcelona and close to the resort of Sitges. Two UK customs officials asked to attend her extradition hearing according to El Confidencial. The Madrid-based judge she appeared before, and decided to remand her while she fights her forcedto the UK, has been named as Joaquin Gadea. No-one could be reached late last night at the Audiencia Nacional, the court which deals with extradition issues. Panitzke, who went to York College for Girls before moving on to fee-paying St Peter’s School which is the third oldest in the world, came from a wealthy family. Her dad Leo was a residential property developer and insurance broker but was arrested when she was  for buying council houses and selling them on early for a large profit and was subsequently sentenced to four years in prison. She is said to studied ten GCSEs and three A-levels. She studied Spanish at Manchester politan University before doing a master’s degree in Barcelona in Business Management. Sarah was recruited into notorious tax criminal Geoffrey Johnson’s web of  fraudsters located throughout the UK after meeting an acquaintance.  She has been described as the launderer of cash from a mobile phone VAT fraud who travelled to places like Dubai, Spain and Andorra to “clean” the money the gang had stolen. Panitzke was part of a group of companies that bought cheap mobile phones in overseas countries without VAT, then sold them in the UK for a big profit. Operation Vaulter, the codename given to HMRC’s investigation into the fraud gang, led to a trial at Kingston Crown Court. Sarah was handed an eight-year sentence after pleading not guilty. She disappeared before the trial had finished. Her links to Vilanova i la Geltru, a former fishing village, were well-known and she is believed to have been allowed to travel to and from Spain where she had been based during her trial. It was not immediately clear last nightpolice had held her at the same residential estate where she was last known to have been living with two dogs and a long-term partner and did “front jobs” as a hotel worker and property investor. Recent reports said she would face  years’ incarcerationcaught because her non-payment of a £. million confiscation order meant further time had been added to her prison sentence. She remained the only member of the -strong gang on the run because ringleader Geoffrey Johnson was arrested in Dubai in  and subsequently sentenced to  years in prison. In  when she first became Britain’s ‘Most Wanted Woman’ her father, who died in April , told the Daily Mail it was a “shock.” Her brother Leon told Vice magazine last year “the whole saga had been incredibly dficult for everyone involved.” At the time he was described as the director of a communications agency.The Costa del Sol was flagged up as a possible hideaway for Sarah after she went on the run.Police described her in their Wanted Appeal as “cm tall, slim build with mousey straight hair, blue eyes and a Yorkshire accent.She was the only woman on the National Crime Agency most-wanted list - and had been for most of the eight years she was on the run. It had said in an appeal: She controlled the company accounts of many companies remotely via dferent IP addresses. Panitzke travelled extensively to further the fraud to places including Dubai, Spain and Andorra. She was responsible for laundering approximately £ billion.

I joined HMRC as an adminis­trative assistant in  – never in a million years would I have thought I’d still be here  years later. But I worked with people I really admired and made good friends. When I started out it was all about admin tasks like filing and sending the brown envelopes people hate. But I was quickly promoted and I learned so much. In March  I was promoted to my current role as customs fraud lead in the Fraud Investigation Service [FIS]. I only manage four people and we’re never going to be glamorous – there are no dawn raids or exciting seizures. The aim is for our team to use our knowledge to lead the FIS to serious customs fraud. I was lucky enough before the pandemic to be part of a team that travelled to Namibia, Madagascar and Tanzania to share how HMRC approaches customs risk. We were presenting to each country and listening to the experiences of their tax authorities. For me it was an amazing opportunity to see how our counterparts work. I’m also customs race lead in Wales. In the past couple of years I’ve really centred my attention on ensuring equality of opportunity for colleagues. In Cardf we’ve set up mentoring, coaching and sponsorship with help from senior leaders. It’s about  per cent of my job and it’s completely changed my le. I’ve had a lot of support from others and I thought maybe I can support others.aposMy job is just so rewardingapos I was originally planning to study politics at Newcastle, but one day I decided to have a quick browse on the Civil Service apprenticeship website. I’d always wanted to work in government and it seemed such an incredible opportunity. I applied on a bit of a whim and went through the interview rounds, and then did a presentation on why more young people need to get involved in politics – but I never thought I’d get in. At first it was a bit of an overwhelming experience, going into these great buildings. You can’t believe you’re in this position, seeing all these really senior people in this massive government office. It took time to get my head around that, getting off the Tube every day with Big Ben behind me. I’m just a normal person! Now I’ve been working here for three months and it’s been great – although it feels like a lot longer because I’ve learned so much. Being in the centre of the Cabinet Office I get involved in lots of dferent areas, so I’m in the community and engagement team for the central GCS team, working on internal newsletters as well as helping run the social media channels. I get paid a full-time salary and still spend  per cent of my time studying. Before taking the apprenticeship I was worried about not making friends like you do in university. But I am part of a large cohort of apprentices and so have had lots of opportunities to socialise with them. I think about  per cent of apprentices go on to get a job. After this I’d like to do something in climate communications, maybe for another COP [Conference of the Parties]. The apprenticeship is  months and so there’s always the option to go back to universityyou decide that it’s not for you.But I think the vast majority of people decide that it is for them. I think it’s really magical. It’s just so rewarding, knowing that every day you’re working to hopefully benefit people, working to help make changes and save lives. aposNo two days are the sameapos When I tell people I’m a civil servant – in particular for HMRC – I get lots of jokes about being lazy, having nothing to do and can I do anything about their VAT s. I never go into specics about my actual role because I am fairly sure it would leave people baffled, but hopefully my career to date shows the Civil Service can be an incredibly rewarding place to work. I joined the Civil Service in  as a frontline manager for contact-centre advisers dealing with the introduction of tax credits, and also worked in HR for four years. After nearly  years, I gained my G promotion to a senior project manager working on delivering IT projects across the entirety of HMRC. This was followed by a brief secondment to the Northern Ireland Office as a senior policy adviser on EU Exit. I then came back to HMRC and moved across into my current role in January. There’s the opportunity to move into dferent professions, and the plethora of jobs available mean that you can continue to grow and learn from each role. No two days are the same and the people I work with are fantastic.aposIt’s very family friendlyapos One thing that I’ve been pleasantly surprised by is how supportive and inclusive the Civil Service is. Being a working mum to Henry, six, and four-year-old Harriet, I think it’s really important to have some flexibility and bring your whole self to work. It’s very family friendly. I work  hours over a four-day week. My managers were very supportive of my request to work Monday to Thursday. My little girl has some signicant health issues, so having that flexibility is so important to me. Tech is usually male dominated in the private sector, but it’s been a refreshing surprise to find that the balance is much better in the Civil Service. Two female staff above me also do a four-day week, so there’s the opportunity to look at that career trajectory. Here in the government financethere’s a good gender balance, lots of ersity and dferent skill sets that people bring to the team. I think it definitely reflects the people in the country we serve, which is exactly what it should do. The civil service is very good at looking at people’s transferable skills rather than overlooking youyou haven’t worked in the same job before. For me, I like doing a role that adds value in society and I’ll hopefully have a career where I can succeed and get promoted. As a working mother, that’s absolutely possible here. Training opportunities are a real strong point, too – from courses to mentoring. I work hard, but I like having the balance and flexibility. That’s worth more to me than pound notes would be. The Civil Service is a unique organisation and you get to be involved in things that make a dference to people around the country. It’s really quite special.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON HMRCThe TreasuryNorthern Ireland OfficeEducationPensionsSchoolsTaxCivil servantsPublic servicesBenefitsTax CreditsMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"couple given weeks move out","story":"Couple kicked out of home - and ordered to pay landlords £ legal billJohn and Cindy Readman, who live on the Sugar Hill estate in Leeds, were ordered to vacate their property by December , but had to stay because they couldnt find anywhere affordable have been told they vacate their home by April \" content\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES n _John-Readman.jpg\" width\"\" \"\" John and Cindy Readmanhave been told they vacate their home by April  Image: LeedsLive WSByJasmine NordenRyan FaheyNews Reporter:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |comments A couple who have just weeks before theyaposre evicted from their home have are now being ordered to pay their landlordaposs huge legal costs.

But, like many tenants on the estate, they found it incredibly dficult to find somewhere to move to they could afford and were told after eviction day passed that the matter had been escalated to the legal process.  John and Cindy are the first to receive notice of the judgeaposs decision, but other residents on the estate are expecting theirs to arrive soon. Iaposm really worried some people will slip through the net, John added. Itaposs all well and goodwe find a place but the people on this estate arenapost just our neighbours theyaposre our friends. And what scares me is that one person wonapost find a place before theyaposre evicted and will end up homeless or sofa surfing. Everyone is bidding on council houses and applying for private rents and they just never get them. Cindy is on the computer and the phone all day speaking to everyone  trying to help them out and some still havenapost got anywhere. These are vulnerable people and thereaposs a real chance someone might not find a place to stay in time. Residents on the estate have said theyaposve found some private landlords discount them immediately as tenants because of the low incomes or benefits several of the Sugar Hill residents receive. In a previous statement, a Pemberstone spokesperson said: “Pre-fabricated properties of this type are officially designated as defective by design and are now well beyond their projected lespan. Multiple surveys have revealed signicant structural deterioration. Pemberstone has been working for over five years to find a solution and it is clear that replacing them with new modern homes in line with local housing policy is the only viable option. A public Planning Inquiry held in  supported this conclusion. “Redevelopment is not possible while the houses remain occupied and their deterioration means that they are now at the end of the time when they can be occupied. In July  we took the dficult decision to serve notice on those residents in the worst affected properties. “Tenants were given until  December to vacate the properties and have been offered an ex-gratia payment of up to £, to assist with relocation costs. Many have already taken advantage of this and over half the properties are now vacant. Leeds City Council has also offered tenants support in obtaining alternative accommodation. Pemberstone understands that it has provided offers of accommodation to the majority of residents affected.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HousingTown CouncilCity of Leeds Council\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Johan Lequellenec and fiancee Naomi Gilham have been waiting over three years to tie the knot after having their previous bookings cancelled due to Covid. The couple, from St Helens, Merseyside, already had their wedding at Azul Beach Resort Riviera in Cancun, Mexico, cancelled twice due to the pandemic. Now, although they fly to the resort on March , the couple claim they still havenapost been given their actual wedding date by TUI. Former welder Johan, , and health carer Naomi, , have been unable to make basic arrangements for the wedding, such as hiring a photographer. Dad-of-three Johan has now lost faith that the holiday company has even arranged the event after struggling to get anywhere with TUI staff in store and on the phone.Speaking today, he said: We are so stressed right now, itaposs not something we can pay for againit doesnapost go ahead. Weaposve been to the Liverpool store and the woman thataposs been helping us has been great. Sheaposs tried all sorts and is as disgusted as us. The CEOs and directors arenapost bothered and the wedding team just tells us to wait. We canapost afford for it not to go ahead. Weaposve put every penny we own into it. No one at weddings will speak to us directly and no one really seems bothered. Itaposs even caused arguments between us.  We paid for a planned wedding for a stress free experience, a once in a letime trip for us but it has been nothing but stress. Johan hit out at TUI on social media on Sunday by sharing a screenshot of a letter from the organisation saying there had been a problem with their booking. He wrote: So weaposve had a wedding booked for three years with TUIand still have no date of when itaposs going to happen. The store has done its very best to deal with it, but the director, CEOs, and the wedding team couldnapost care less. Before booking your wedding with TUI just think about this post.  When told by a TUI rep to contact the store that they booked the TUI holiday through directly, he responded: TUI they have done. The woman that has been dealing with us has done all she can but no one to complain to at weddings.We leave in less than four weeks after being booked three years ago and no wedding date, nothing has been organised for our wedding at all.A TUI spokeswoman told the Mirror: It can take up to eight weeks from us receiving a fully completed and signed wedding contract and customers receiving confirmation of their wedding date. This is clearly communicated and included in the wedding contract. We received the customers’ contract on January  and can reassure them that our wedding team will be in touch in the coming days, within our standard eight week turnaround.

It comes after clear evidence shows an increased risk to peopleaposs safety when running alongside another participant with a dog, with some becoming tangled in or tripping over the dogaposs lead.A statement reads: We carefully record and review all parkrun-related incidents, and our global incident database allows us to make operational decisions based on the reality of what’s happening in our parks and open spaces.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Over ten percent of incidents at parkrun events involve dogs, and as such we have spent signicant time considering the nature, frequency, and severity of dog-related incidents. Our evidence shows that, when participants use waist harnesses, there is an increased risk of serious incidents, particularly trips and falls, compared to when using handheld leads. These are typically associated with dogs running in front of other participants, and are occurring when people are together in groups, when people with dogs are overtaking others, and when people with dogs are being overtaken. Unfortunately, the nature of parkrunning with a waist harness is such that the lead allows dogs to move from side to side, in front of the participant, which can result in the dog suddenly and unexpectedly crossing in front of other participants on the course.Under the new rules, dogs should be kept on a short, handheld, non-extendable lead by the side of the participant and should remain within reach at all time. As always, only one dog is allowed per participant and care must be taken to avoid tripping other parkrunners. The statement added: Since the earliest days of parkrun, we’ve openly welcomed people participating with their dogs. Paul Sinton-Hewitt, the founder of parkrun, would participate in the Bushy Park Time Trial with his, and we’ve always felt that it was not only something that emphasised the informal nature of our events, but provided an opportunity for dog owners to participate where they otherwise might be excluded. Over the last  years however, we have grown from a single event into a global movement, with hundreds of thousands of weekly participants, across  dferent countries. As such we continually review our processes in order to balance accessibility and inclusivity with the safety of our participants and other park users. Importantly, we remain of the belief that, overall, the benefits of allowing participation with dogs far outweigh the risks of doing so. Our commitment has always been, and always will be, to support participation with dogs wherever it is appropriate to do so. Do you have a dog story to sell  Email paige.freshwater@reachplc.

Anthony Bleakley lives with his family of six in a housing association home in Heywood, Manchester.He told ManchesterEveningNews : We only put this wallpaper up six months ago, it just falls off. But itaposs the hole in the floor below it thataposs the most shocking.We took up the laminate to show more evidence [of the damp]. I was standing on it and it just fell through. Under the floorboards, he says he can see a pool of water.  He added: A lot of the water has gone now but there still is some. When it rains it fills up a lot. Anthony, who has been living in the house for three years, has covered the gaping hole with a playhouse. He said: Iaposm a groundworker by trade so I know whataposs gone on. On their road, the rising damp has affected multiple houses and is a failure of damp proof courses, according to Matthew Condrad, the director of Tenant Claim, who is representing Anthonyaposs family. He says the type of damp proofing the housing association used only has a lespan of around  years - and now it has expired. Two of the four kids in the home have asthma. According to the NHS website,there is mould and damp in the home youaposre more likely to have respiratory problems, respiratory infections, allergies or asthma. Damp and mould can also affect the immune system.Natalie Lake is another resident who lives on the road and fears for her childrenaposs health. Her daughter, Jorja-Maria Lake, has recently been diagnosed with asthma. She said: Sheaposs only three. Her asthma gets so bad she ends up in hospital. Sheaposs very young. Natalieaposs home has many of the same damp problems as Anthonyaposs, she says.  She lted up the laminate in dferent corners of her living room to expose the rotten floorboards. She said: When I walk around the house at night I can feel the floor breaking. Iaposm sure thereaposs water underneath. Itaposs just everywhere. Natalie and Anthony have said that theyaposve both been going to their housing association - Rochdale Boroughwide Housing - for help. But so far, they claim that nothing has been done to properly combat the damp.  Natalie claims that when she had rats, it took them around three years to sort. She added: My mental health went through the roof with the rats. I just feel really upset and angry and frustrated. Anthony said: We keep reporting things but nothing is happening. They keep fobbing us off. They think they can get away with it because we live here and theyaposve got us trapped. The couple had plans to buy their home through Right to Buy in what would be a aposbig savingapos, but are now put off by the aposdisrepairapos of the property. He added: We keep wanting to get the house done up but thereaposs no point.  Lawyer Matthew Condrad told MEN: The properties are affected by rising damp, which is rotting the floorboards, ruining furnishings, and threatening the health of residents. Floorboards are collapsing, and pools of water are visible underneath, from which water is rising into the floorboards, skirting boards and lower walls. This rising damp is due to failure of the damp proof courses. A chemical injection damp proof course has been inserted to alleviate damp, but its approximate -year lespan has expired, meaning that urgent repairs are required in the area. Rat infestations are also a reoccurring problem, causing an additional health risk to residents. A spokesperson from Rochdale Boroughwide Housing said: We received a report of a rat infestation behind one set of homes on Cedar Avenue, Heywood in late . Following a detailed survey, we commissioned extensive drainage work to recty the problem. This was completed in late January . We have not received any further reports of rats in this area. We recently received a report of damp in a home on Cedar Avenue. Our joiner attended on Friday, February , and confirmed that further work is required. We will undertake this work as quickly as possible. RBH tenants who need to report an issue can do so quickly and easily by phone, by e-mail to customerexperience@rbh.org.uk or via the MyRBH online portal.

She was referred to hospital and sent for a brain scan before her vision began to deteriorate and she was eventually diagnosed with Juvenile Batten Disease in January. The rare genetic condition causes loss of sight, speech and mobility skills over time and children who suffer from it are not expected to live beyond their teenage years.Emilyaposs family were shocked by the diagnosis as she had always been perfectly healthy, reports Hull Live.They have now been advised by the hospital to make as many memories with Emily as possible before her illness gets worse. Rebecca Atkin told how the first sign of her daughteraposs condition came from a routine Specsavers appointment in the summer of .She said: Emily has worn glasses since she was four but her vision only sat on the borderline of needing to wear them. During the appointment, upon taking pictures of her eyes, the optician noticed that part of Emilyaposs eye was flat where it would usually be curved and referred her to Hull Royal Infirmary. Due to needing a specialist, Emily was referred to a hospital in Newcastle in October  and she underwent EEGs to determine the issue. Throughout the pandemic, the family said they heard nothing back from the hospital but noticed Emilyaposs vision was deteriorating a lot. Becky described seeing Emily struggling to see the computer screen and holding books very close to her face to make out the words, as she was being home-schooled when schools were closed. In February , Emily was declared severely visually impaired and she is now on the blind register. The family were then referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital for genetic testing and Emily was diagnosed with Juvenile Batten disease in January.  Emily has also started to struggle with her speech which was never the case before.Her family described the youngster as a bubbly girl and have set up a Go Fund Me page hoping to raise £, to give her the fantastic memories she deserves.Parents Becky and Ricky Atkin said: Emily is the kindest, sweetest, most gentle and loving girl that you could ever meet. She does not have a bad bone in her body and her happy nature canapost help but make you smile. She loves to talk. We literally canapost stop her sometimes and she keeps us laughing every day. Her strength and resilience the last few years make us beyond proud, she doesnapost let this disease get her down and always has a smile on her face. Becky said that Emily always had lots of friends, and she has a great relationship with her older brother, Lewis. Perhaps the most defining trait Emily has is that she is a Harry Potter super-fan and routinely asks her mum to call her Harry while dressed in her very own robe and sitting on a broomstick. Becky said that her daughteraposs obsession grew after she visited the Harry Potter Studios on her eighth birthday and was enchanted by all things wizard. The family are hoping to use the donation money to take Emily to Universal Studios in Florida so that she can experience the Harry Potter World there and watch the Cursed Child on the West End before Emily can no longer see. Within four days of the Go Fund Me page being set up, the family have already received almost  donations totalling £,. They said they have been blown away by the generosity of friends and strangers. All I can say is thank you, and I canapost say how much this means to us, Becky added. We set the target really high, with going to America in mind, and really didnapost think it would come close or this quickly at all. We imagined it would be next year that we could think about booking the holiday, but it may be a lot sooner than that, which is great.

The police and legal experts have some good advice for people in this situationThere often isnt anything the police or council can do about a car blocking a driveway Image: Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesByBenjamin LynchTrends Writer:,  Mar |comments For residents on tightly packed and busy streets, a blocked driveway can be a complete nightmare. Not knowing how long it will be until the car is moved and you can carry on with your day, be it the school run, going to work or any other reason can put plans on hold.A blocked driveway may just be an unfortunate part of where a person lives, but sometimes angry residents are justied in their annoyance. Certain conditions under the Highway Code mean that a car should be movedit is blocking a driveway.Unfortunately there is also a legal loophole that means motorists can park in annoying places. So what are the conditions under the code that mean cars can be moved Where in the Highway Code does it say you canapost park in front of a driveway   Rule  of the Highway Code states that people should not stop aposin front of an entrance to a propertyapos. However, this only relates tothe car is also blocking the road. Charlotte Dixon, a solicitor at DAS Law, told The Mirror in : The Highway Code can only helpthe parked car is causing an obstruction to the road but not in relation to private land.  Also, not all Highway Codes are legally binding and there is a dference between you aposmust notapos and aposdo notapos. Rule  comes under the latter and stipulates people should not stop unless forced to do so by stationary traffic. A legal loophole says that any car can park on your driveway and local authorities cannot do anything about it because it is private property. It can be removedthe police suspect it to have been abandoned, butthe car has a valid MOT, is taxed and insured and is not in a dangerous condition then there is little the police or council can do. Someone is blocking my driveway, what are my rights   There are several steps you can takea person is blocking your driveway. You should first checkthe space outside your house is designated parking. If it is not, then strangers have a right to park there just as much as you. If someone is parked in your designated space, you can contact your local authority, but there is always the chance the driver has not realised and the issue may be solved with a polite note or conversation.  Dixon said: The first step with any anti-social parking problem is to contact your local authority or the police however there is little the law can do to support home owners – evena car blocks your driveway. One option that’s available is to pursue a legal claim for nuisance on the grounds that the driver is interfering with your use and enjoyment of your property – but to do so you’d need to know the identity of the offending vehicle’s driver. The Met Police also advises people to contact their local authority first. They said: If someone has blocked your driveway so you can’t drive in, we appreciate this can be very frustrating. If you can find the owner of the vehicle, we’d first recommend asking them politely to move it. If you can’t find them, try leaving a note on their windscreen. After all, they may not realise they have caused a problem.

One reviewer said: Dreadful hotel. We booked it last minute and wished we had done some research. First impressions weren’t great - there was a slurring, swearing woman falling over a sofa in the bar which adjoins the reception then the rooms are pretty grubby and smell of stale smoke. But the real issue is this hotel isn’t just for travellers: there is a huge poster in the reception advertising cheap wedding packages. Half the rooms are directly above theroom and it appears no effort has been made to stop the noise from these cheap weddings travelling. So it is midnight, we have an early morning flight to catch and have zero chance of sleep as there is music blaring up to our rooms from downstairs. The manager on duty couldn’t care less.While this hotel may advertise itself as an airport hotel,you need somewhere to stay before a flight, avoid this place like the plague- it has no interest in meeting your needs. Another TripAdvisor user titled their review aposThe FILTHIEST hotel I have ever stayed inapos. During February this year, Evie Wilman said: Staff were lovely - no complaints there. The entire hotel reeked, to the point we felt sick. Got to our room, opened the door to something that looks like it hasn’t been decorated in  years.   plug sockets weren’t working so couldn’t charge everything we needed to for the flight, had to do this from my car. This is where it gets bad, we weren’t comfortable here so we started to look around just for cleanliness.  They then continued: Carpet not hoovered, crumbs everywhere. Breadsticks under the bed. Hairs in the bed. Poo-stained towel. Mould in the bathroom. Stained wall with God knows what. Dust everywhere. One guest claimed they endured their aposmost dreadful Christmas everapos at the hotel and was apospleasedapos when they couldhome. The hotel boasts leisure facilities including an indoor pool, gym, sauna and squash courts. But TripAdvisor user Nannapam claimed the facilities were closed during their stay. They said: We were given this hotel as a Christmas four-night stay as a coach holiday with Just Go. Staff were lovely, trying to make up for the awfulness of the hotel but they were disorganised and totally overwhelmed by several coach parties arriving for a Christmas stay. All food was in buffet style, not particularly appetising and certainly not hot. Christmas lunch was served at tables but so over cooked it was inedible. The room we had was not a bad size but the bathroom was just unacceptable, with only a sprinkle shower in the bath and any extras needed having to be asked for, such as toilet rolls. There was a swimming pool, which would have made the stay a little better but was closed on Christmas day and Boxing Day. Nothing  much to do there, can go for a short walk but nothing  in the near proximity of the hotel. Entertainment was there each night of the stay, first night was brilliant but downhill after that. A disco was put on for Christmas night but was so loud, could not stay in the same room. Just pleased when our stay came to an end and we couldhome.  After arriving at the Airport Inn at .am, TripAdvisor user Ian slack said: On arrival we experienced the couple in the next room arguing loudly with themselves, this carried on through the night and at .am I phoned the reception to get the noise stopped. Which didn’t happen. You would expect that a hotel called the Airport Inn would cater for travellers arriving late at night, and have some sort of noise code, similar to the Premier Inn. When I expressed my dissatisfaction on checkout the staff member on duty was . Also the hotel is grubby and tired, the bathroom was stained, as were the carpets. The whole appearance of the hotel was that of a rundown, past it’s best business. I wouldn’t touch this establishment with a barge pole. There is at least one guest who left happy, however. One four-star review - the only four-star rating in the past four months - was left in January by a satisfied customer. They said: Good reception got us checked in efficiently. Now to the rooms, I have no complaints or observations about dark wood headboard or furniture, I do have observations about clean white sheets and clean white towel. Dinner buffet style and for what we paid [on] the night very acceptable in fact I had the very tasty chilli. Good nightaposs sleep followed by a very good breakfast. The toaster did only toast one side though, which I am sure some people could make a huge drama about. Well done to the catering staff who could not have worked any harder or been more helpful… A very good nightaposs stay and would not hesitate to stay again.

It is where they settled as newlyweds shortly after their wedding in , with the couple renting a farmhouse near the seaside resort of Rhosneigr in Anglesey.At that time Prince William was based as a search and rescue pilot at nearby RAF Valley and Kate was often seen at the local Waitrose supermarket and other shops - including a watersports shop near her home.And on one trip to the shop, called Funsport, Kate suffered a rather embarrassing moment - and gave the shopkeeper, who didnapost recognise her, a secret name.  While in the shop buying a wetsuit, Kate was left red-faced when she realised she had forgotten her purse. Oblivious shopkeeper Dave Buckland then asked Kate for her name when she askedshe could reserve the wetsuit to collect later.And the name she gave him was Mrs Cambridge - and according to the Mail on Sunday, the shopkeeper was still none-the-wiser.

An unnamed source told the newspaper back in : “He was looking straight at her and actually commented that it was quite an unusual surname.  “He hadn’t a clue who she was. She just smiled and said she’d be back. He hasn’t lived it down since.”Kate and husband William probably wonapost have time for shopping today though on their trip to Wales to mark St Davidaposs Day. They will be travelling to both Abergavenny and Blaenavon and will learn about the importance of the agricultural industry for rural communities and how they celebrate the history of local regions. In Abergavenny, they will visit Pant Farm, a goat farm, which has been producing milk to a local cheese producer for nearly  years. Later they will visit Abergavenny Market to visit local producers while in Blaenavon they will stop off at Blaenavon Hwb - a community-focused youth centre. There they will meet young people the centre supports and take part in activities including making Welsh cakes.

Then, after their relationship broke down, she only communicated with her by putting notes under her door and “shouting” at her bedroom window from the garden, the tenant claims.In a video seen by the publication, the landlady’s friend appears to call the -year-old a “delightful c***” and a “peasant” before attempting to snatch the phone from the tenant, prompting the landlady to intervene. Screenshots also allegedly show the landlady attempting to end Mel’s three-month fixed-term contract early. Mel says her landlady, who charged her £ a month to live in the two-storey Victorian house, was fine for the first two days after she moved in last December, but then “restrictions started raining down”.Sheena gave Mel a printed set of rules that restricted her access to the kitchen during the day while she ran PT sessions from home. Mel claims Sheena also restricted her to only coming down the stairs once a day to avoid disturbing her while she worked in the lounge. She also claims she was banned from having deliveries sent to the house as the doorbell was too distracting. She said the wardrobes in the property were also full of her landladyaposs personal stuff, leaving her no choice but to store her own belongings in the loft or the shed. Mel claims that Sheena told her via WhatsApp : “You pay for a ROOM. If you want full access to the half, pay half the bills too. When you can pay £, you can have equal say! Have some respect and not be so bloody entitled.”Responding, Sheena said the printed rules were “part of the lodger licence agreement and that the pair’s personalities “were not a good fit”. She added: “I agreed to move to the living room so she could have access, but she walked up and down the stairs several times and moved her belongings so I realised it wouldn’t work.” On December ,  days after she moved in, Mel said her landlady gave her a one-month notice to leave the property. But on January  Mel claims Sheena asked her tenant to stay and apologised for being “feisty”. Mel said she agreed to stay, on the condition she would have a “trial period” until the end of the month. Sheena claimed the trial period was “conditional on us resolving our dferences which we didn’t. WhatsApp screenshots seen by MyLondon allegedly show Sheena changed her mind, telling Mel on January : “I will give you written notice tomorrow to leave on the st of January. I don’t care [about] the contract, I just want you to leave.” On January , Mel was once again served with a notice to leave - this time by February . By that time, Mel claimed that Sheena had blocked her on WhatsApp and was refusing to speak with her in the house, communicating only through notes passed under her door and letters from her solicitor. Sheena explained: “I used notes to avoid further personal clashes which were very distressing and personal to me during my workday.” On January , Mel received a notice to leave the property at the end of the fixed termfrom Sheena’s solicitor. Four days later, on the night of January , Sheena invited guests to her home. When Mel asked the group to turn down the music they were playing, she claims one of the guests confronted her. Mel filmed the encounter, threatening to call the police. The video, seen by MyLondon, allegedly shows the friend responding: “For what  You f***ing peasant. What a delightful c*** you are,” before attempting to snatch the camera. Sheena can allegedly be seen intervening to calm the situation and telling Mel: “Call the police. It’s fine.” A Met spokesperson said: “Police were called at .pm on Friday, January  to reports of a civil dispute at a residential property in Longfellow Road, Worcester Park. Officers attended and gave words of advice. No arrests were made.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON WhatsAppproperty news\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

RMT union members walked out due to concerns over pensions and job lossesA dispute between RMT and TfL led to a strike Image: PAByBenjamin LynchTrends Writer:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsLondoners are facing a travel nightmare as TfL workers go on strike, with service limited or suspended completely on London Underground lines. The Rail, Maritime and Transportunion are on strike in protest at what they believe to be threats to their pension and jobs.TfL - which the government announced funding for last week - has previously revealed between  and  station posts are set to be axed, while the pensions scheme is under an independent review. RMT general secretary Mick lynch said: Our members will be taking strike action because a financial crisis at LUhas been deliberately engineered by the government to drive a cuts agenda which would savage jobs, services, safety and threaten their working conditions and‎ pensions. Londoners will be wondering how long the disruption will last and which lines will be closed as they struggle to get to work. Which tube lines are on strike today   Before the strike, no service was expected to occur on all underground lines. Currently, TfL is reporting suspended service on the following lines:Bakerloo Circle Hammersmith  City Jubilee politan Northern Piccadilly Victoria Waterloo  City Partial service has so far been reported on the following lines this morning:Central - operating between White City and Ealing Broadway  West Ruislip, and Liverpool Street to Loughton. Also operating between Newbury Park and Leytonstoneat a aposreduced frequencyapos. District - operating between Upminster and West Ham, between High Street Kensington and Wimbledon at a reduced frequency. There is no service on the rest of the line. OvergroundGood service is reported on the following lines:DLR - although Bank and Canning Town stations are closed TfL Rail TramsHow long will the strike last   RMT ordered the strikes to take place from : until : on March , then again on Thursday March . Travel early on Wednesday and Friday is likely to be disrupted too as the tube starts up again. There could well be further disruption in the future as TfL continues to struggle financially. The agreement for funding reached with the government on February  is not a long-term deal and only runs until June .  The transport organisation has to now prove it is financially stable and capable of effective service, but others feel these are cuts by the back door and it is workers who will be affected. RMT said this crisis has been deliberately engineered by the government. TfL said: TfL’s actions to make London Underground more efficient and financially sustainable – including an independent review of its pension arrangements – are in response to Government conditions of funding agreement. Despite this, TfL chief operating officer Andy Lord said of the RMT strikes: It is extremely disappointing that the RMT has today announced strike action, as no proposals have been tabled on pensions or terms and conditions, and nobody has or will lose their jobs as a result of the proposals we have set out.

Kate Green complained of feeling funny and within just  minutes the -year-old went from walking and talking, to mumbling and frothing at the mouth.Kateaposs husband Adam told Yorkshire Live : Sheaposd taken my son swimming and had just got back and walked in the house.She had just gotten into the hallway and said aposI feel really funnyapos and I asked when it had started and she had told me aposwell just, Iaposve got a headache in the back of my headapos and I thought that was strange because you donapost usually get a headache in the back, itaposs usually the front or the side. Adam said that, within minutes, his we was laid on the bed upstairs in the fetal position and had started to have trouble speaking and breathing properly. She said aposI donapost feel right, I canapost moveapos, so I told her that I was calling the doctor and I knew it was serious because she didnapost say aposdonapostapos, Adam, , said. The GP surgery told Adam to immediately ring for an ambulance.  Adam said: Kate was murmuring and frothing at the mouth, thataposs when Stanley got on the bed and said aposmummy, mummy I love you mummyapos and then Vicky thankfully arrived and took him downstairs. But Kate started breathing really weirdly, it was a growling sound - like a death rattle - she was really struggling to take a breath and she looked like she was locked in. A paramedic told Adam that her symptoms were indicative of a severe bleed on the brain and when she was taken to Rotherham Hospital, staff told Adam that Kate had suffered an acute pontine stroke. This type of stroke can lead to what is known as Locked-in Syndrome - where a patient is conscious and aware, but completely unable to move. He said: They effectively told me that I needed to call her family and I had to call them to say aposyou need to come to say goodbyeapos, as we thought the worst was going to happen. Kate had been put into an induced coma when she arrived at the hospital so that doctors could assess what damage had been done to her brain. Adam said that it did not take long for small miracles to begin happening as, a few days later, staff had turned off her ventilator to see how she would respond. When Kateaposs ventilator was turned off, she opened her eyes and took a large breath.  Adam said: But even at that point, there was no indication as to what quality of le she might have. The worst case scenario when she was admitted was that she would die, but then it kind of shted slightly to she might be in a vegetative state and be in a nursing home all her le. But then, after  days, she opened her eyes and her occupational and speech therapists were asking her questions, so she was looking up for yes and down for no, so theyaposd ask her questions about her le and were trying to catch her out with some questions to see what her mental capacity was like. Theyaposd ask her things like aposyour husband is called John apos and sheaposd look down and they would say aposoh itaposs Adam, is it apos and sheaposd look up. Then, they used an alphabet board so they could communicate and sheaposd spell words out. Adam added: One of the first things I remember is coming onto the ward one morning, the speech therapist told me that sheaposd managed to spell my name, Stanleyaposs name and the word aposloveapos - it completely did me. That was my almost epiphany that she was going to be alright because her brain is there and sheaposs got a bloody big brain - sheaposs very tenacious. She doesnapost ever back out of anything that she says sheaposs going to do. Sheaposs got so much to live for and there was no way she was going to lay back over this, she was going to fight it. Though there have been some horric lows over the last three months - such as coming to terms with the idea that Kate may have Locked-in Syndrome for the rest of her le - Adam said that there have also been moments of tremendous hope and joy. And one of the biggest moments of joy was when Kate began to move the left side of her body, proving to Adam that she was determined to overcome her paralysis and begin recovering. Adam said: I think it was her left thumb that she moved first and things started coming back quite quickly on the left side. And then her toes started moving, against all the odds, it was absolutely remarkable. Sheaposs got pretty much full mobility in her left side now, but she has no strength and thataposll come with physiotherapy. Though she is still bedbound and living on the stroke ward of the hospital, she is speaking again and able to spend time with Adam and Stanley - who desperately misses his mum. Adam said: He misses his mum and is worried heaposs never going to hear her voice again - the voice it was before, because she sounds dferent now. But he comes to the hospital and tells her what heaposs been up to in the day. Heaposs seven and he just misses his mum, thataposs probably whataposs driven Kate so much, is him. Adam has launched a fundraiser so that Kate can get the care she desperately needs, and he has been blown away at the response - with over £, worth of donations in less than  hours. Adam said: Sheaposs very, very well respected. I went in today and told her that weaposd launched a GoFundMe page and she asked how it was going, I told her that it had gone over £, and she just lost it, she burst into tears. We know itaposs a very, very long process, but sheaposs doing all this against the odds. It was a very, very bleak picture and the consultant on the ward that sheaposs on now said that, in his whole career, sheaposs the only one who has ever survived this stroke.

Having recently adopted Sausage, also known as Soz, Paul breach of his self-imposed clause in his contract, which is said to prohibit him from taking animals home from the centre while filming.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. He mentioned this some years ago and revealed that under no circumstances was he allowed to go home with any more animals from Battersea, reports the Standard.Sausage, a wire-haired dachshund, ended up in Batterseaaposs centre in London after being found as a stray in Poland.Paul said on Instagram : I took this hairy little monster home. Sheaposs called Sausage, which isnapost very original but it doesnapost matter as she canapost understand a word of English except aposbiscuit.aposShe gets on with all the others except for Conchita who simply ignores her but Nancy loves her and together they’re a right pair of hooligans.  So far Sausage has eaten her way through a couple of dog beds, an armchair, endless pairs of socks and shoes and the stair carpet but she’s the friendliest dog on the planet so what’s a pair of shoes between friends  Sausage loves cartoons or animations, call ‘em what you like. She’s been glued to the telly watching an animation of George Orwell’s Animal Farm with not a peep out of her.

Paul married his husband Andre in the summer of  after the lovebirds had been dating for ten years before they tied the knot. The smitten pair got together in the mid-s after meeting at a gay club in London called Showplace.Although they have been married for almost five years, Paul and Andre actually never lived together until the coronavirus pandemic struck.Paul previously confessed that the idea of living separately from his husband was inspired by Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Burton - who famously lived apart throughout their marriage. We’re doing a Helena Bonham Carter and Tim whatshisname, and it works a treat, he told Irish News. It’s the same as before. We see each other all the time. We just don’t live together, which for me makes for a perfect relationship because when you’ve had enough, you can say aposI’ll see you, I’m offapos. I’m a bit cranky of a morning. I’m a cobra. I don’t get up, I’m exhumed, and I slither down the stairs looking for trouble. But otherwise I’m fine. Andre’s pristine, you know, ­everything’s tidy – and I’m not. However, when the pandemic struck and the strict isolation rules came to play, Paul decided it was time to move in with Andre so the pair could be close and look after their animal brood together.

Putin raised the awful spectre of nuclear confrontation because he’s losing, or at least not winning as easily as he expected. His calamitous miscalculation in invading Ukraine is backfiring badly now, and the world is uniting against him. He faces a battle at home too, as anti-war protests swell in Moscow and other cities. The pressure on Putin must be intensied, never relaxed, until he has withdrawn the last of his forces from the country he attacked.  And then he must face judgement. He must be held to account for an unforgivable assault that will cost many lives on both sides, including civilians. Many more are being forced to flee their homes in terror. Britain has sent military equipment and is picking up speed on sanctions but much more can be done to help Ukraine. Oligarchs close to Putin must be pursued relentlessly. And we should take in our share of Ukrainian refugees.

On one occasion, when she discovered a dead slug on her dinner plate, she responded in the best way.The Queenaposs former servant, Charles Oliver, recalled the incident and how she reacted in his book aposDinner at Buckingham Palaceapos, reports MyLondon. Oliver revealed that when the Queen and her late husband Prince Philip would eat together, they would keep a notepad next to their plates so they could make notes about the meal and give their feedback to the chef.Once, on a torn-off top sheet the footmen found the dead body of a slug, Oliver said.

On the note, the Queen had written: I found this in the salad—could you eat it  She then sent the plate of food and the note back to the kitchen, the Daily Mailaposs Weekend magazine reports. One of the chefs, Darren McGrady, says the Queen chooses all of the food that she eats off of specic menus from the kitchen. Darren explained: The chef does three days’ menus and that gives us enough time to get all the produce in and prepare it. When the menu book goes up to the Queen she puts a line through all the dishes she doesn’t want.If she’s out for dinner she’ll put a line through the page. Andshe has a guest coming she’ll put two or three, so we know she is entertaining,” Darren said. He also revealed that she hates pasta, garlic and onion, but she loves to eat chicken or fish with vegetables or salad. The food she does like, on the other hand, is kept under lock and key as she has never revealed them, not even to the staff in the kitchen. Former royal correspondent Gordon Rayner, who has covered more than  royal tours, discovered this fact from someone who worked with the royal family.  He explained to The Express : As one of her staff told me, aposIf she said she had a favourite meal she would never get served anything .aposBefore sheaposs due to travel for royal duties, someone from the team will also go on a ‘reconnaissance’ mission to make sure itaposs up to standard, andnot, to make any necessary tweaks. The Master of the Household department will be in the reconnaissance party to tell foreign chefs not to cook anything with garlic or too much spice for fear of giving the Queen bad breath, and not to cook shellfish or anything that could cause food poisoning, he added.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

We headed out right away when they opened at am right now it’s pm and we’re still going. “By the time I’m done putting everything away it will probably be nighttime.” The family have storage space in their basement, but have so much food that they’re often forced to store items in the hallway and even the bathroom.

Dr. Anthony regularly shares nuggets of medical wisdom with his . million TikTok followers, educating them on fascinating health and human biology-related topics such as how to live  years longer and where does hair come from A recent video, which has been viewed more than . million times, has left followers particularly engrossed, revealing that there is in fact a notable correlation between fingerand penis size.The doctor went on to detail a study, published in the Asian Journal of Andrology back in , which was carried out on  Korean men over the age of twenty.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The men, whoaposd all been hospitalized for urological surgery, were anaesthetised before their respective operations, having given their informed consent beforehand. Whilst they were still under anaesthetic, the surgeons measured theof the menaposs index and ring fingers, before going on to measure the size of their penis whilst it was flaccid and stretched out. It was determined that the men with smaller index fingers were more likely to be on the bigger side, while those with ier index fingers had smaller members. As per this study: Based on this evidence, we suggest that the digit ratio can predict adult penile size and that the effects of prenatal testosterone may in part explain the dferences in adult penile .  After running through the study findings, Dr. Anthony - who goes by the username tonyyounmd proceeded to display his own hand, which he compared with the digits of another TikTok doctor, Dr. Ricky Brown, smirking as he asked fans to look at that long index finger!The clip has made quite the impression on Dr. Anthonyaposs followers, who of course couldnapost help but take a quick glimpse at their own fingers. One person wrote, “I have small fingers... this can’t be right. While another user fretted, “I was scared at first because I have short fingers.Do you have a surprising health-related story to share  We pay for stories.

Things quickly became serious, with Edwardo popping the question back in November . According to Brocarde, her ghostly partner asked for her hand in marriage by leaving a diamond ring on her pillow after a loversapos tf.Interpreting this as a proposal, Brocarde happily accepted, publicly announcing her engagement soon afterwards.However, ever since revealing sheaposs engaged, Brocarde claims sheaposs had to field off a number of messages from living men begging her to ditch Edwardo and give them a chance instead. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.She says her inbox has since been flooded with as many as , messages, a great number of which have been sent by men begging her to kick her ghostly fiancé to the curb.Brocarde admits sheaposs been left amused by some of her more imaginative admirers, revealing: The messages are hilarious one guy wanted us to sleep in a coffin, another collected taxidermy insects and another’s biggest selling point is being aposaliveapos – I mean, what more could you possibly want ” The singer has shared a look at several of the emails, with one man declaring her to be too stunning to get hitched to a dead man, pleading with her: I’m alive baby alive and ready for you! Marry me ” Another implored: “Omg don’t marry that psychotic spirit, marry me. I will treat you right and not scare you like that! I can leave messages in the shower and take you away for real. While a third beseeched: “I’m a real soldier in the army I’m not Victorian or dead or anything special but I’m a good hardworking bloke who will look after you and show you a good time.  Despite all the effort her admirers have gone to, with one even penning her a poem, Brocarde claims she hasn’t been tempted by any of the messages sheaposs received so far. However, Edwardo is still said to be furious, and has made his feelings on the matter known. According to Brocarde: I didn’t say a word but Edwardo is furious about them, when I read them the lights flickered like crazy, the room turned ice cold and my phone just went black and died. It wouldn’t turn back on for hours even when I plugged it into its charger. Mysteriously, when the power came back, several of the messages were in my trash folder so Edwardo is not amused.  Brocarde - who claims to communicate with Edwardo in alternative ways, including cryptic shower messages - has opted against engaging with the messages, leaving her devotees awaiting her response. She explained: “I love it when people reach out and send lovely messages about my music and designs or show genuine interest in what I create, but the personal notes about dating, sex, or critiquing my appearance just make me feel really uncomfortable. My mind often boggles, I often feel mischievous and get tempted to reply and say ‘yeah sure let’s get married’ just to see what would happen next. I never do though as strangers online can be far scarier than ghosts. She added: I think it was more the amount that was scary, hundreds of messages per hour, it was impossible tobecause of the sheer amount of proposals and love bombs hitting my inbox.Do you have a supernatural tale to tell  We pay for stories.

While some owners donapost mind shouting for aposSergeant Squishybumapos or aposCaptain Fluffytuffapos in a park, others would do anything to avoid this situation.But one owner has sparked a debate over his dogaposs unusual name. Turning to Reddit for advice, a woman explained how she asked her neighbour to change his dogaposs name because she thinks itaposs inappropriate and offensive. to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  She said: Itaposs like living next door to Jay from the Inbetweeners. His dog is called Boner. Every morning I hear aposBoner, Boner, BONER COME BACK INSIDE!apos. It may sound funny when you first hear it and only when you realise he is talking to a dog - but I hear this every day. I canapost imagine him shouting it in the street or at a park. Whatthereaposs children around and he is screaming for Boner  Itaposs just not OK. The Inbetweeners is a British TV series which follows four sixth formers as they navigate through adolescence. Jay, who is played by James Buckley, is one of the main characters who is known for his crude jokes and foul language.Claiming to be a huge dog lover, the woman regularly pets the labrador from over the fence, saying this interaction brings her a few seconds of joy.Boner is a lovely dog and itaposs not his fault he has an offensive name. I look at the dog and think aposPoor little thing with a name like thatapos, she added.  We have quite low fences so the dog can jump up, put his paws over and I can pet the top of his head.When celebrating her dadaposs birthday at the weekend, the woman and her close family braved the weather to enjoy a BBQ in her garden.During the party, her neighbour let Boner out into the garden to use the bathroom - and he soon jumped up at the fence to see what was happening next door. She added: Boner jumps on the fence for his pets and out comes my neighbour calling him in. It was so awkward for me. I had my parents and grandparents round and my neighbour keeps shouting for his dog. While a bit drunk, I asked him whether he has considered changing his dogaposs name because itaposs inappropriate. He just laughed and went back into his house.I feel so awkward for asking him because he should have free will to name his dog - but also why would you pick Boner  Feeling guilty about asking her neighbour to rename his dog, the woman has been trying to avoid him since their awkward encounter. I wouldnapost usually do anything that but it just got to me that day, she added. My neighbour takes great care of his dog. The dog is really happy and you can tell he is well loved. While most users questioned why she deems Boner an aposinappropriateapos dogaposs name, others tried to reassure her by saying sheaposs reading too much into the situation. One user said: I can guarantee that your neighbour hasn’t thought about you telling him he should change the dogaposs name oncehe thought you were joking.  I wouldn’t worry about seeming like an a*** unless you made a huge deal out of it. It’s also not even an offensive name in my opinion. It’s easily explained like someone  already said as aposWell he’s a dog an all dogs love bonesaposa kid asks. And your guest should understand you don’t have control over your neighbours and you don’t like the name either but that’s literally not in your control. There’s zero need for you to be embarrassed about your neighbouraposs dogaposs name. Just call him something  like Bone or Bosaying Boner makes you uncomfortable around guest. There are people named Richard that go by Dick and Iaposm sure no one is telling them aposHey, that’s an offensive name stop using it.apos It would probably be annoying to hear him yell out any name repeatedly every morning but I think you might be getting off easy with Boner cause I can think of so many worse names. While another said: You’re oversensitive. Boner is not especially offensive, and it can be explained -required - to kids as dogs like bones. Lay off. A third said: When I was younger my grandmother had a dog named s*** The novelty wears off with such names. Butit makes you feel any better the dog doesn’t know what a boner is.

However, itaposs important that boundaries are respected. One woman has been left feeling uncomfortable after her sister overstepped the mark a bit with her fiancé, Gabriel, treating him as though he was the father of her young son and inviting him to attend his activities as her plus one.According to this baffled bride-to-be, the sister has previously made jokes about how much of a dad -year-old Gabriel is to her son, Joe, always asking him to drive them to places. She once even drunkenly asked whether Gabriel would be comfortable with adopting Joe, despite the soon-to-be-wed couple having already made the decision to remain child-free.The perturbed woman says neither she nor Gabriel feels comfortable with this arrangement at all, but they were unsure of how to push it aside without hurting their feelings. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Taking to Reddit, the worried woman explained that their mother has warned her sister that her behaviour is inappropriate on countless occasions. However, sheaposs always responded in a defensive manner, claiming that Joe chose him and that it is not her faultapos.Things recently came to a head last weekend after little Joe asked Gabrielhe could call him dad, telling him that his mother had said it was fine. All the while, the sister looked at the pair with the biggest smile on her face, while their mother and brother - who donapost agree with the situation either - watched the scene unfold as though they were expecting his answer.The concerned aunt - who goes by the username u EntireAd - wrote: [Gabriel] sat Joe in his knee and kindly explained to him how he wasnapost his dad or even a dad figure, that he was auntaposs partner soon to be husband and that made him his aposfavoriteapos uncle, but evenhe wasnapost his dad, he would never leave him and theyaposll always be best friends. Joe, being the sweet kid he is, laughed and smiled and said that it was okay, then he ran to the living room to play with something. The poster believed the situation has been resolved quite well, with Gabriel having explained things to Joe in a kind and caring manner. However, her sister wasnapost happy at all with his response and began getting into an altercation with them both. She continued: My mom kept telling her to shut up but she was saying things like aposwhataposs wrong with you two apos, aposhow can you say no to a little kid apos, aposhe sees you as a father, so you should be proud of thatapos, I had enough and I told her that Gabriel wasnapost Joeaposs dad and that she needed to stop acting ashe was because it was honestly embarrassing. At this point, her sister began using foul language to insult her and even accused her of being jealous of her son. They decided it was time to leave, but her sister still wasnapost done with them. The poster wrote: She later sent me a text saying that it was bestwe step out of Joeaposs le for a while or we will end up aposconfusingapos him because he doesnapost understand that Gabriel is not daddy. But, as far as I could see, he got it pretty well. Many of those commenting were disturbed by the sisteraposs behaviour, with some even wondering whether or not she might harbour romantic feelings towards Gabriel. One person wrote: I dated someone who had a aposfriendapos who’d lost her husband recently and continually tried to make my boyfriend the new daddy to her kids - always asking him to come to their sporting events, having them draw him pictures, asking him to babysit, etc. It culminated in her making a move on him and proclaiming that her kids saw him as a dad and they aposneeded himapos. Just keep an eye out. Another commented: I am also wonderingthere isnapost a jealousy element. Not that sis wants Gabe for herself, but she is jealous that while she struck out on the partner lottery, her sister hit the aposjackpotapos, ie., she apparently has someone who loves her, and agrees with her, and isnapost going to go absentee on her.Do you have a nightmare family situation to contend with  We pay for stories.

The prince looked embarrassed and like he doesnapost want to be there, expert Dr Lillian Glass claimed - while adding that Meghan on the other hand, is in her element.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex took to the stage in Los Angeles on Saturday and accepted a top accolade at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored PeopleImage Awards.They were presented with the prestigious President’s Award in recognition of their distinguished public service and humanitarian work. International renowned body language expert Dr Glass analysed their appearance at the event. She said there was a distinct dference between the couple’s appearance on stage, as Harry appeared “uncomfortable” compared to his we. Dr Glass told the Express : “Harry looked like a fish out of water as he didnapost know what to do or how to comport himself as he looked down at the award and examined it and then rocked back and forth and pulled away from Meghan.“He straightened up for a while when she quickly turned her head towards him and shot him a not so pleasant look indicating that he was on stage and to be aware of it and to shape up. “He purses his lips in embarrassment and then cocks his head like a wounded puppy and then looks at the camera. “He is not smiling the whole time he is up there. He then forgets and looks back at her and looks down and then s to facing the camera. “While looking at the camera he continues to rock back and forth like a child that feels uncomfortable because they have a full bladder.”  Dr Glass said Harryaposs rocking back and forth indicated he didnapost really want to be at the event. She added: “Meghan on the other hand is in her element as she looks directly into the camera and speaks eloquently.” Dr Glass also said the Duke’s appearance was surprising, considering he had grown up in front of a camera. She noted: Harry is clearly not happy and uncomfortable as indicated through his body language at this event.”During their acceptance speech the Sussexes paid tribute to the people of Ukraine amid the ongoing crisis and called for global support for the country.Harry took a moment to talk about the war, the need to fight injustice and listen to the voiceless, saying: “Before I begin, we would like to acknowledge the people of Ukraine who urgently need our support as a global community.”“I think it’s safe to say I come from a very dferent background to my incredible we, yet our lives were brought together for a reason. “We share a commitment to a le of service, a responsibility to confront injustice and a belief that the most overlooked are often the most important to listen to.” The couple’s public activism has resulted in criticism from some royal watchers, however, Meghan added that she “couldnapost be prouder that weaposre doing this work together.” The Duchess then said: “We are so deeply humbled to be here in the company of such illustrious awardees.”  Harry wore a black tuxedo by Ozwald Boateng for the night, while Meghan sported a sapphire-blue gown by Christopher John Rogers. The awards ceremony marked the Sussexesapos first joint public appearance of the year, which sparked a flurry of excitement from their supporters.Former recipients of the Presidentaposs Award include Muhammad Ali, former US President Bill Clinton and singer Rihanna.Also at the event, Meghan and Harry launched the new NAACP-Archewell Digital Civil Rights Award, in recognition of those who are creating “transformational change at the intersection of social justice and technology”.

But where in the country, it appears Russians are meeting fierce resistance - even from unarmed civilians.In a series of clips shared by the BBC, everyday citizens can be seen challenging armed soldiers and standing in front of tanks trying to enter their hometowns.In one video, a man standing in front of a massive Russian tank tries to stop it with his bare hands. As he does, the tank pulls to a halt before the man slaps the bonnet and walks off.  In another clip, a man pulls up beside a a Russian armoured vehicle and asks: Are you guys broken down . Soldiers respond, saying theyaposve run out of fuel, before he jokes: Can I tow you back to Russia . Another shows a crowd of civilians cheering and whistling after a military vehicle bound for their town turns around. They havenapost let the tanks into town, they turned them around, one man says.  In more videos of resistance, a Russian man who says he lives in Ukraine is seen blasting a pair of soldiers. You have your country and we have ours, he says. Meanwhile Putinaposs war machine rumbles along, with footage from earlier today showing rockets hitting a civilian apartment block. It comes after Putin was accused of breaking international law by using deadly vacuum bombs. The bombs suck in energy from the surrounding area to generate extreme temperatures when it explodes.  They are also capable of vaporising human bodies. It comes as Russiaaposs defence ministry warned Ukrainians of looming airstrikes in Kyiv. Russian officials said they are preparing to launch high-precision strikes against technological centres of the Ukrainian Security Service and the nd main PsyOps centre in Kyiv.  The statement reads: We urge Ukrainian citizens who are being used by nationalists to carry out provocations against Russia, as well as Kyiv residents residing near relay stations to leave their home. Earlier today Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was filmed raising his fist in solidarity as EU leaders gave him a standing ovation. Zelensky told the European Parliament that Ukraine was apospaying the ultimate price to defend freedomapos during the video call. He told the EU lawmakers: “Do prove that you are with us. Do prove that you will not let us go. Do prove that you are indeed Europeans and then le will win over death and light will win over darkness.

One message read: “Are U sitting in the bunker   Like a rat ” Others slammed her for enjoying an expensive lestyle while Putinaposs actions cause thousands of deaths and untold suffering for millions of people. Luzia is the daughter of cleaner-turned-multimillionaire Svetlana Krivonogikh, , who is now part-owner of a major Russian bank. Svetlana owns a plush £.million Monaco mansion and has not commented on claims that her daughter was fathered by Putin. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blogHowever, she did tell Russian GQ that she probably looks similar to a young Vlad. Putin has never publicly acknowledged Luzia as his daughter. Luiza - who has , subscribers - stopped publicly posting five months ago, triggering the suspicion that Putin had gagged her.However, her account remains visible and one post on the -year-old’s Instagram says she is the “daughter of a murderer, war criminal, psychopath and drug addict”. Many posts include the Ukrainian blue-and-yellow flag and one carried the message: “The Russian nation must rise against this dictator. You donapost want to have anything to do with him.” But, whilst many railed against her, some commenters also defended her, with one saying: “Donapost judge her...is not her fault.” Another wrote: “She cannot do anything for having a crazy father”. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putinaposs troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nationaposs army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous.On Sunday, February , Ukraineaposs health minister reported that at least  Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than , wounded. On March , Ukraine claimed to have killed , Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently veried but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than  civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least  people have been killed, including  children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher. It comes as Ukraineaposs President accused Russia of aposstate terrorismapos on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv.  One more said: “Come on guys, she is just a person. She is not guilty.” But a commenter called Martina hit back: “Yes, she is guilty of passive complicity. It is the same as most of the Germans in the Nazi period.” Another penned: “Call him -he loves you ... maybe you can convince him not to kill.”  One posted: Stop writing sheaposs an innocent. She is the daughter of that devil! She could at least show that she does not agree with what her father is doing, somehow influence him. “Putin doesnapost give a s*** for ordinary people, but maybe his daughters still mean something to him. “She stays quiet because she knowsshe says one bad word to Daddy, she will be cut off from big money, apartments and expensive things. “Unfortunately, there are important things - and more important things. Apparently, purses and villas are more important to her than human le.”Putin has two daughters by his ex-we Lyudmila, the former Kremlin first lady. Likewise, neither of them - Dr Maria Vorontsova, , a geneticist, and Katerina Tikhonova, , a dancer-turned-mathematician, has commented on the war. Reports today suggested Putin had ordered his family to hide in a luxury hi-tech bunker in Siberia. A troll suspecting she may be in her mother’s Mediterranean bolthole said: “While you’re fluffing around in Monaco, people of your generation are dying in Ukraine because of your father.  Further messages highlighted the actions her supposed father is taking and how Russian troops in Ukraine were rumoured to not know where they were or what they were doing. Others pointed to the collapse of the Russian economy under her reported father and slammed her for her expensive branded lestyle. Luzia faced criticism as Ukraine continues to suffer under siege from her fatheraposs forces whilst she previously posted pictures of her le at cafes, on trips to Paris, running her own fashion label or working as a DJ.

That means we must throw open our doors to Ukrainian refugeesVladimir Putin has chosen the path of war Image: Getty ImagesopinionByVoice of the Mirror:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments Today we salute the bravery of the Ukrainian people as they struggle to repel the biggest invasion of their country since .Their sacrices in the name of freedom are heartbreaking, humbling, but inspiring. And it is the duty of every civilised nation to do all we can to help them.The air raid sirens wailing over Kyiv  years ago warned against Nazi attacks, not Russian ones. ButVladimir Putin objects to being compared with brutal dictator Adolf Hitler, he has only himself to blame. Like Hitler, Putin’s word cannot be trusted. Like Hitler, he promised peace while all the while being intent on war.Like Hitler, Putin cares nothing forindependence and liberty as he attempts to recreate an empire.And like Hitler, he plans to subjugate a sovereign nation with all the force and brutality at his disposal. Just as we faced down Hitler, we must face up to another dictator determined to destroy the freedoms we hold so dear. And we must do it without sleepwalking into a Third World War.  Boris Johnson compared this invasion with that of Czechoslovakia in . This time there must be no appeasement. That occupation set off a chain of events that took six years of horrying war and  million deaths to resolve. Ukraine must regain its rightful independence sooner than that but, nevertheless, we must be prepared to be in this for the long haul. Now that Putin has chosen the path of war, he has to win it, and we dread to imagine the horrors that might unleash.  That means we must throw open our doors to Ukrainian refugees who appeal to us for a safe haven and might even want to stay here. We are told such a resettlement programme is being prepared. But, as always in Whitehall, the wheels are moving despairingly slowly. Ireland has waived the need for visas for Ukrainians. The Irish will get them to safety first and worry about the paperwork later. We should follow that example. Now it is incumbent on the rest of the world to isolate Russia as the pariah state it is. Even Putin’s traditional ally, China, has shown a certain ambivalence to the tyrant’s actions.  It abstained on the UN resolution to condemn Putin for the invasion – a promising result rather than a great one. President Xi of China is the one man who might persuade Putin to withdraw and he should make every effort do so. Meanwhile, the rest of the world must put a stranghold of sanctions around the Russian state. And NATO must stand firm and resolute.  The borders of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland are the NATO red line. Putin must be left under no illusion about the lethal consequences of crossing it. Andthe Russian people are as truly opposed to this war as they appear to be, there is only one course of action open to them: to topple the man who caused it.

But by the time I was on the case, the disease was spreading closer to home # in forests near Loch Carron, Ross and Cromarty.Phytophthora, ominously meaning #plant destroyer#, is a genus of fungus-like organisms containing around  known species with a worldwide distribution.The genus, which includes the pathogens that cause potato blight and sudden oak death, has been responsible for massive crop failures, economic loss and environmental damage.Phytophthora are called #fungus-like# since they behave like fungi but dfer from them, and from all animals and plants, in several key features of their reproduction and chemical makeup.This places them in an ill-defined group of misfits called protists, which also includes amoebae, kelp and slime moulds.Phytophthora pluvialis was discovered in Oregon USA in , where it resides in soil and watercourses, and mainly infects Douglas fir.Its recognition in Cornwall during  was the first identication of this particular Phytophthora species in Europe.Thought to have arrived here on imported live plants, its spores germinate in water and can be spread, for instance, on shoes, tyres and animal paws.The pathogen infects a iety of trees, including western hemlock, Douglas fir and several pine species, causing needle shedding, shoot dieback and lesions on the branches, trunks and roots of infected trees.Forestry and Land Scotland and its policy section Scottish Forestry took rapid action # surveillance to detect infected forests, restrictions on the movement of timber and trees, and asking the public to report suspicious tree lesions.But since the European climate is ideal for P pluvialis to thrive, and its favoured trees are commonly grown here, like so many other plant pathogens, it seems likely that this one is here to stay for the long term.Forestry and Land Scotland asks foresters and the public to be vigilant for signs of Phytophthora pluvialis.Anyone who thinks they might have spotted signs of the disease should report it using the online TreeAlert system on the on www.forestresearch.gov.uk website."},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry loop sportive announced","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe popular Kilberry Loop Sportive will take place on Saturday August  this year.Organised by Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle Club and local man John Hardie, the -mile open road event starts and finishes in Tarbert.Registered as an event with British Cycling, the fun, friendly Kilberry Loop Sportive is targeted at every level of cyclist.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

a place in September this year, a % decrease on the previous year.Pan London said factors such as ying pressures on councils, the longer-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic which meant families had relocated for work, as well as the ongoing effect of Brexit could explain changes in application numbers.Cllr Damian White, London Councils’ chairman of schools and children’s services, said: “The number of pupils starting secondary school in London remains high, and with % of the capital’s schools rated good or outstanding by Ofsted it is no surprise that parents are keen to send their children to school in London.“Today’s admission figures show that the number of secondary school applications in London have remained stable compared to last year and we are delighted that % have been accepted into one of their preferred schools.”Cllr White said councils are “dealing with growing demand in services for children with special educational needs and disabilities , which has unfortunately been exacerbated by the pandemic”.Martin Pratt, chairman of the Association of London Directors of Children’s Services, said the Pan-London Admissions Scheme ensured that “school places are distributed by local authorities in an open and fair way”..remove“I can reassure parents that there are sufficient places in London’s secondary schools to meet overall demand,” he said.“The scheme ensures that parents receive a school place offer at the school which is highest in their list of preferences for which they are eligible under the admissions criteria.”.push,i[r].l*new

buildings in terms of the aesthetic value they bring to the town#s outstanding seafront location.I fully understand the need to reduce housing stock, in line with a declining population, but previously demolished buildings in adjacent areas – Saddell Street and Queen Street – are now unsightly gap-sites.Local opinion is important, given what has happened in the wake of recent housing demolition. There is concern, often heard in local conversation and frequently discussed on Facebook, of what might happen in the latest round of town planning.To be fair, plans are afoot to replace the same with modern housing – probably less stock to suit the demands that exist in the town at the moment – however, it is really important any proposed build be sensitive in design to suit this prime parkland location, an area fronting onto Kinloch Park and town#s seafront Esplanade.I share this concern, given the results of previous demolition, but also hope any future plans will include

Thursday, Ofgem announced that from April the energy price cap would rise  per cent to £, – that is an extra £ households will have to find just to keep their homes warm and the lights on.Forthcoming increases to the interest rate and rises in National Insurance payments will exacerbate the situation.It is heart-breaking. I have had food bank helpers in tears saying we can#t wait another year for the Right to Food to kick in. People need help now.Food bank volunteers need assurance that the invaluable support they provide in their communities will end one day, when wages and benefits are adequate enough for proud families to be able to stop using the food banks.New statistics show rising homelessness across Scotland.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks. You can also sow outdoors, but use cloches or small poly tunnels until next month when the soil has warmed up. They will also provide your lettuce seedlings with protection from birds and slugs.Good ieties to start now include cut-and-come again Salad Bowl – oak leaved, high yield with green and red ieties a cos such as Lobjoits Green – dense, crisp heads with self folding leaves or the small butterhead Tom Thumb – perfect for growing in small spaces, it matures early and has a mild taste.Prepare for spring by carrying out basic maintenance.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, this month there are signs of the approaching spring, with bulbs appearing and wildle waking up as light levels and temperatures increase.There#s plenty to do indoors this month to prepare for the season ahead.Outdoors, as the garden comes to le, it#s time to prune shrubs and climbers, such as wisteria, as well as evergreen hedges."},{"url":null,"title":"driver woes derail oban golfer bobs title bid","story":"The honorary Machrihanish Golf Club member finished tied in ninth place at the Ras al Khaimah Classic on the final leg of the DP World Tour#s Desert Swing, building on his solid performance over the same course the previous week.After carding an almost flawless opening round of  on Thursday, Robert suffered a cruel piece of bad luck before his Friday round after the face of his driver cracked during his warm up on the practise range.Speaking after carding a  on Saturday, following his  on Friday, Robert said he struggled with his replacement driver.#Unfortunately, my driver cracked on Friday morning and I#ve not got the perfect replacement but no-one does,# said the left-hander.#Off the tee, I#m trying to find my golf ball.

only to the local people whose lives are enriched by music, but also for the tourism on which so much of the local economy depends.#Campbeltown and the surrounding district is famed throughout the world for its traditional music and it would be very unwise even to consider implementing measures which would effectively bring this reputation to an end.#He added: #I am lending my strongest support

If you are sure you know something to be the case beyond contradiction, you don#t need faith.Doubt, on the other hand, is strongly linked with faith because, while you may have faith strong enough to move mountains, there is always the possibility your faith is misplaced.I would argue the existence of God is proven by large amounts of evidence, but in the end that is a matter of faith.The Bible recognises this right at the start where Adam and Eve leave the Garden of Eden and do not see God face-to-face anymore.From now on, they, and we who come after them, must live by faith.This is what it is to be human – and faith is always open to challenge.When suffering occurs, when disaster looms, people ask, #Where was God # and use what has happened to deny God exists.Yet the faithful keep believing. Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"oban golfer bob shines in californian sun","story":"With  top  world-ranking players in the field, the honorary Machrihanish Golf Club member was going head-to-head with the one of the strongest fields assembled outside a major championship.Having shown signicant signs of ato form in his previous two tournaments in the United Arab Emirates, this was a chance for the left hander to build on his progress and climb back towards the top  in the world rankings.An opening level par  on Thursday left Bob in the middle of the pack after day one.

The mine was finally rediscovered by HMS Bicester early last week.Bad weather made it impossible for the crew of the Bicester to attach a surface riser to it and the mine was left to a Navy ing team to bring it up.Led by Lt Adrian Dann, the four-man Northern Diving Team from Faslane finally pinpointed the mine on Tuesday morning and brought it up later that day.The two-tonne mine is currently lying on the New Quay waiting to be picked up by the mine laying team from Cromby, Fe.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown churchgoers, in common with other congregations throughout the country, are being asked to sign petition forms calling for an end to public filth in television and literature.Already many people, including non-churchgoers, have appended their names to the forms which are also in several businesses in the town.The forms are headed: ‘Petition for public decency.’It states: ‘Being concerned about the effect on society – particularly on the young – and of the increasing exploitation of sex, the public portrayal of intimate or unnatural sexual behaviour and violence and brutality, we the undersigned call upon Her Majesty’s government: to note the concern of the public about this matter. to ensure that the law as regards of sanity stops this public affront and is so designed as to be an effective instrument for the maintenance of public decency.Some church congregations in the town have already begun signing the petition and others planned to follow suit in the near future.All of Campbeltown’s ministers are in agreement that the obscenities on television and in literature are going too far, and hope that the petition has the desired effect.The Reverend James W Hood, of Lorne Street Church, commented yesterday: ‘I think it is perfectly right that the church should be given the opportunity of speaking its mind.’SEVENTY YEARS AGOThe majesty and pomp of King George VI#s funeral procession through London, and later its journey to Windsor Castle, was seen and heard by people in Campbeltown and Tarbert on Friday, in the history-making experimental television broadcast.In both places, reception was remarkably clear and those who were privileged to see it saw this royal journey of dignied and poignant pageantry in a much greater detail than the vast crowds in London and Windsor.At both places, the sets, with -inch screens, were shown by radio dealers to parties of friends.Mr Anthony P MacGrory, Campbeltown town councillor and housing convener, had his set installed in the radio showroom of his firm’s shop in Main Street.At Tarbert, the set there was arranged by Mr Douglas C Smith, Electrical and Radio Engineer, Harbour Street.Earlier last month, Mr Smith informed us that he was getting surprisingly good results from the test from the Scottish television station at Kirk o’ Shotts – the Scottish station which is using only low power transmission.Scottish TV reception of this historical occasion was the previous day viewed with serious misgivings and doubts by BBC experts, who pointed out that the Kirk o’ Shotts station was not due to open until March  and that this is the first-ever television radio link up, connecting Scotland to London, through Manchester, was merely an experiment and the Scottish transmitters were still undergoing adjustment.So, until the TV programme went onto the air on Saturday, the BBC could give no guarantee that the venture would be successful.It was a great success and thousands of Scots over a wide area, from Dumfries to Aberdeen, saw clear pictures of the funeral processions.At Campbeltown and Tarbert, the pictures were almost as clear as everyone was looking at them on the cinema screen, the detail in some of the pictures being unbelievably perfect.One local businessman, who saw it, described it as ‘uncanny’.But, throughout the years, this has been the descriptive of all great inventions when they first made their impact on the public mind.It was a pity, of course, that this great moment in Scottish television progress should have been heralded in with such a sad event as the funeral of our King.Considering that Kintyre was not regarded as a good reception area and that this  miles relay was the longest ever attempted by the BBC, the result was truly amazing and will no doubt mean the booking of many orders from this part of the country.Already, Mr McGrory has been receiving enquiries from ious parts of Argyll.We were privileged to see the screening in Mr MacGrory’s premises that afternoon. The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television network, it must have been an unforgettable experience to have this outstanding London ceremonial brought hundreds of miles to before their eyes and to be taken in imagination straight to Windsor to watch the Royal coffin being carried out and upon it the Imperial State Crown, the orb and the sceptre and the white wreath of orchids, camellias and lilies of the valley from Her Majesty, the Queen

The project team would like to highlight that the mocked-up photograph was produced to illustrate the scale and impact of a major flood event on Musselburgh, and is derived from the council’s new Scheme Hydraulic Model.It is understood that this specic location, by St Peter’s Kirk, has flooded on at least four occasions in recent memory: , ,  and , with the event of  being the smallest event. Alongside the mocked-up photograph that Mr Taylor describes as “fake news”, the project placed an image of actual flooding from  at this location. No photographs exist from the other events however, it has been determined that the event of August  was equivalent to the one-in--years flood event from today and that the flood waters that day would only have been approximately mm lower than shown in the mocked-up image.The project team would like to highlight that the scale of water that would flow down the River Esk and or inundate the town during these events is almost unimaginable to anyone that has not experienced such an event – this is not considered a “cataclysmic” flood scenario as described by Roger Crofts on February : Musselburgh has a very high level of flood risk today as it did in , and this will get worse in future years due to the impact of climate change. The scheme’s flood maps are equivalent to the flood risk mapping previously undertaken by SEPA and which is available at their website.Mr Taylor also stated that “four bridges will be demolished at a cost of £ million, which will effectively cut off one part of town from the other”. The project team would like to highlight that at no point has the council ever considered removing and not replacing existing structures, as the importance of connectivity within the town is clearly understood. The project team would like to highlight that at this point, no decision has yet been taken on the form and design of these replacement structures.The council are comfortable that the scheme already includes a suite of flood risk reduction measures that include natural, sustainable and catchment measures. This includes: a debris trap by Whitecraig as requested by Roger Crofts on a number of occasions modication to existing Victorian reservoirs in the South Esk catchment to hold flood waters away from Musselburgh and protection of the Musselburgh coastline to allow the sand to continue to build-up naturally.The project team are, however, clear that Musselburgh cannot be protected without new defences along the River Esk’s banks through the town and along the coastal foreshore. The design of the scheme is not yet started, therefore any rumours of m-high concrete walls are not considered a valid concern.The project team will be in The Brunton on March  to continue to consult the town before the outline design commences.

Males have a chestnut-brown back, light brown chest with black spots, and a prominent grey-blue head and tail, whilst females are unormly brown. Like most members of the falcon family, the kestrel is equipped with black eyes. The purpose of this is to reduce the amount of glare entering the bird’s eye and improves vision, especially in bright light.Kestrels are mostly distinguished by their typical hunting technique, hovering -m above the ground, either by flying into the wind and using its fanned tail and pointy wings to hold position, or by soaring using the lt caused by a ridge or a similar obstacle. The bird keeps its eyes constantly fixed on the ground and, when it eventually spots prey, it swoops down and kills using the side of the beak rather than using talons like hawks do.The kestrel’s hunting skills are enhanced by incredible eyesight. These birds can see ultraviolet colour that is invisible to the human eye! This means they can easily locate their prey by detecting a rodent’s urine trail, which shines brightly in ultraviolet.Apart from watching kestrels in the air, they can also be seen perched on a tree branch, fences, lampposts or wires.These birds mainly feed on field voles, which constitute most of their diet, but can also take mice, shrews, small birds and occasionally worms or large insects .Kestrels do not build nests but instead they lay eggs in natural cavities such as holes in trees or cracks in clfs. If you live in the countryside, a good way of encouraging kestrels to the area is to put up nest boxes for them. Each bird species has dferent requirements when it comes to nest boxes, so it is worth researching online as to what the right measurements should be. Feel free to get in touch with myself as well!With just a little bit of patience, kestrels can be easily spotted. Once you have learned their hover style, you will not mistake it for anything ! Another good tip for looking for kestrels is to remember that they are birds of habit –you saw them perched on a tree in the local park, try going there again at a similar time, there is a huge chance they will be around!In East Lothian, I have two favourite kestrel spots: one is in Musselburgh Lagoons and the other one at The Grove. I visit those places fairly frequently at dferent times of the day to give myself a greater chance of photographing the birds in dferent light, but it is worth remembering that birds are most active at dawn and dusk.So far, I have found kestrels surprisingly relaxed with my presence however, I would not feel confident to say whether all kestrels are like this orI have been lucky. The rule of the thumb is to remain respectful of an animal’s space and never to disturb them I always move slowly when taking steps towards an animal and never in a straight line, so it does not feel challenged. After each step, I remain in the same position for quite some time before taking a further step – this way an animal can get used to me and stops treating me as a threat. I always use this approach, no matter which animal I photograph.As spring is just around the corner and soon wildle will be in full swing, I wish you all good luck in wildle spotting!If you would like to share some wildle sightings with me or want to know more about kestrels, please get in touch:www.zanslenswww.facebook zanslenswww zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"josh-taylor-retains-world-titles-jack-catterall","story":"The Prestonpans fighter came into the bout with a perfect record of -.However, he was far from his best at a packed OVO Hydro in Glasgow tonight .Catterall proved elusive throughout much of the fight and many in the venue had the Englishman as the winner at the end of the  rounds.However, the judges scored the fight - to Catterall, - to Taylor, and - to Taylor.Understandably, the home fans were delighted by the decision but it was a very, very close decision.Taylor was fighting in Glasgow for the first time since he was crowned world champion for the first time.That saw him take a points decision over Ivan Baranchyk to lt the IBF Light Welterweight title.Speaking in the ring to Sky Sports after the bout, Taylor said: “I started a little slow but then I got back in my rhythm.“He tried to spoil a lot.“It wasnt my best performance, I put a lot of pressure on myself with it being my homecoming.“But I believe I got the win  per cent.\"It looked like the telling moment in the fight came in the eighth round.Catterall scored a knockdown leaving Taylor seemingly facing an uphill battle.Thirty-one-year-old Taylor certainly finished the fight the stronger and that proved crucial.Both men raised their hands in victory at the end of the  rounds but it was the home favourite who was celebrating.Taylor has spoken previously about making the step up in weight.In the ring, he said that was “most likely” his last fight at lbs.He said: \"I made the weight good but it is getting harder to make the weight.“That will most likely be my last fight at lbs.\"That would mean no rematch for Catterall, who will feel he did enough to win the belts."},{"url":null,"title":"sky-reveals-content-coming-sky-tv-channels-now-march-2022---get-sky","story":"With a iety of films, documentaries and TV shows featured in the list, March could be a busy month of TV for Sky viewers.You can get Sky TV here.Highlights include Reminiscence, the  film that sees Hugh Jackman help his clients gain access to memories that are lost.

He has put Tommy Shelby on the wagon. Believe it, brother.Only an event of seismic proportions could have brought such a change in a character. Sure enough , as we catch up with everyone’s favourite back street razor gang turned criminal big shots, the worst has happened to Tommyand the rest of the family. Aunt Pol, played in glorious fashion by Helen McCrory, is no more.It was not a change anyone wanted to make, but in real le, a place crueller than any fiction, McCrory died last year. Her character deserved an exit fit for a Gypsy Queen. She got it.The deed done, the action shts forward four years. Tommy Shelby is in his usual striding mode, head down, meaning business, a black dogby his side. He’s a long way from Birmingham, though, in Miquelon Island, Newfoundland.Though prohibition is over Tommy has big plans for the ships that ran booze to America. To that end he is meeting Michael Gray, Polly’s son, who blames Tommy for his mother’s death and has sworn to have his revenge.Thus the stage is set for a final sub-Shakespearean showdown between the ambitious young prince, Michaeland Tommy’s king.But what of the other players who have strutted and fretted their hour upon the Peaky Blinders stage  Brother Arthur, sister Ada, Tommy’s we Lizzie, Johnny Dogs, and the rest  They too have been changed by Pol’s death, Arthur most of all. Poor Arthur, half man, half grenade. How can Tommy hope to conquer America without all the family by his side If this is the end for Peaky Blinders on television – there are plans for a movie though– then where better for the Sopranos of Small Heath to bow out than America  Only in America would mobsters like the mighty Jack Nelson, whose acquaintance we have yet to make but whose legend precedes him, mix with presidents.America suits Peaky Blinders in other ways. This has always been a show with cinematic ambition. Indeed, Knight premiered the first episodes, back in , at the Edinburgh Film Festival. From the slo-mo swagger of the central characters and the drop dead stylish clothes, to the modern music applied to a period setting, it was obvious this was a small screen drama with big ideas.While it has stumbled occasionallyPeaky Blinders has built an army of devoted followers. If this firing on all cylinders opener is a guide, this could be the best series yet."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-reduction-short-term-lets-blessing-many-hollowed-out-communities","story":"So there will be an \"exodus\" from the sector, as landlords of short-term lets switch to long-term residential accommodation, and this is \"likely to have a plateauing effect\" on rents. But isnt an increase in the availability of long-term lettings exactly what cities like Edinburgh and Glasgow need  And how can any \"plateauing\" of rents be anything other than good news for hard-pressed tenants Mr Pickard expresses concern about \"tighter control around things such as gas and electrical safety certicates ... water safety certicates ... furniture and appliance checks\". But anything that improves the safety of tenants is surely to be welcomed.A reduction of Airbnb-style properties will also be good for the owners of traditional hotels and BBs, who up to now have faced increasing competition from short-term lets. The same benefit will be felt by ordinary people who might rent out a room in their home or let out their entire house while on holiday, as such lettings are not subject to the legislation.In fact, just about the only people who wont see an immediate benefit from the licensing system will be the owners of short-term properties and their agents. And even these iniduals wont suffer a total loss. As Mr Pickard himself points out, many of them will switch to long-term lettings, which will provide them with a steady income for the foreseeable future. And all of them will benefit from the long-term increase in property values, which is presumably one of the main reasons they invested in Airbnb in the first place.With all this in mind, its hard to see why you used the word \"warning\" in your headline over this story. I would suggest \"promise\" would be a better description.Mike Lewis, Edinburgh.BRING BACK ANTENATAL CLASSESI WOULD like to bring to the attention of the general public the fact that NHS Scotland has made the decision to cancel all antenatal classes for this generation of expectant mothers.Young and first-time expectant mothers are particularly affected by this decision. Whilst a few midwe appointments, often online, are allocated to each woman, these do not act as a substitute for the lack of classes. How can blood pressure and oedema be measurednot seen face to face The NHS’s own website states that “classes give a chance to ask questions and prepare for labour, birth and afterwards\". It is unfortunate that the opportunity to do so has been removed. These were also a means of encouraging fathers to fully participate in the birth process and in later child development.Interestingly, National Childbirth Trust’s excellent classes are still operating for those fortunate enough to be able to pay more than £ per course. Is it fair that those with financial means should be given the additional practical and emotional support not given to others When does the NHS intend to resume these maternity services  When will there be an apology and further guidance issued to those new parents who have missed these opportunities If we wish to raise a generation of physically and emotionally healthy children surely these issues need to be addressed not only for iniduals but for society as a whole.Sandra Aitken, Glasgow.PARKING LEVY IS NOT TRULY GREENTHE workplace parking levymust be seen for what it is, a revenue generator for Scottish local authorities in addition to that already generated through the council tax or revenue handed to local authorities from central government .The WPL was never part of a skilfully crafted environmental policy. Instead it was a trade-off between the Scottish Greens and SNP administration, with the latter requiring the votes of the former to have tits budget approved in parliament.Considering the WPL as an environmental policy is simply a myth. It contains exempted premises, mainly in the healthcare sector. Our hospitals have the busiest, potentially most polluted car parks in the country and the suggestion that healthcare staff don’t drive polluting vehicles, is simply farcical. A truly “green” policy would not contain exemptions of any kind.Alan Knox, Carfin.THE GREAT AND THE GOOD AND THE BADMARTHA Vaughanincorrectly stated that the first official photographic sitting of the Queen after her accession to the throne in February  was  days after she was crowned.

This two-day tour intends to show you the delights of the city, but do pick and choose what appeals. We’ll visit cultural landmarks, explore mostly on foot, and of course, take in the best of the city’s food and drink alongthe way.gtgt DAY ONETHE first day of our tour takes in the Meadows, Arthur’s Seatand plenty of cultural and foodie hot-spots.Start the day in Marchmont, a leafy residential area, with a cracking breakfast at Argyle Place. Cold-pressed juices, a changing breakfast menu including favourites like Mackerel Kedgeree and sweetcorn and ricotta pancakes, and the Mr. Eoin in-house coffee roastery make this the perfect place to fuel up for a day exploring Edinburgh.If you’d rather take-away then nearby Elliott’s is a delicious option – they make an excellent breakfast roll – choose from sausage, soft boiled egg, mustard and lemony greens, or crispy coriander seed potato, soft boiled egg, and harissa-yogurt.Wander from here to the Meadows, a large grassy public park where students and locals love to meet friends, exercise, barbecue or play sports. The Meadows has beautul views of our beloved extinct volcano Arthur’s Seat. If you’d like to go up, it’s just a ten-minute walk from the Meadows to the start of the path.It’s a popular route but do go prepared, sturdy footwear and a good jacket are needed year-round. From the summit on a good day, you can enjoy wide-ranging views of the whole city, across to the Pentlands and the Lammermuir Hills, over the water to East Lothian and Fe and up the Forth to the Forth Bridges.RENAISSANCE STYLEIf this sounds a bit strenuous then have a wander around the central University of Edinburgh campus instead.Much of the original architecture around George Square has been replaced by less than lovely s slabs and modern offices but look for notable older buildings including Italian Renaissance style McEwan Hall, where students graduate – presented to the university by local brewer William McEwan in  , and grand Old College on South Bridge – which also houses the Talbot Rice Gallery.Take time to explore the winding streets of the Old Town.It can be very busy as the student-dominated Newington meets the throngs of tourists on The Royal Mile but don’t let that put you off. This area is full of cafés and noodle bars and plenty of independent businesses – don’t miss Lighthouse Books, one of Edinburgh’s best independent bookshops and the place to discover bold, important literary voices. They also run events including Edinburgh’s Radical Book Fair every November.The National Museum of Scotland on Chambers Street is a vast and interactive museum that could easily fill days of your visit. My tip is pick just two or three galleries and really enjoy exploring them, and then plan atrip. Make sure to visit the roof terrace on level  for panoramic views. To really get to grips with the history of Edinburgh’s Old Town a visit to Gladstone’s Land is enlightening – learn how residents lived and worked in this tenement from  to .From the Royal Mile follow Cockburn Street down to the Fruitmarket Gallery and bag a table for lunch. The gallery recently reopened after an extensive expansion so enjoy exploring the new space. Currently you can see a major exhibition of work by American artist Howardena Pindelland a mesmerizing site-specic installation – Jyll Bradley’s Pardes .From here head over to the New Town. If you are in the mood for more art, then a visit to The Scottish National Portrait Gallery is always worthwhile.VIBRANT SPACESThe New Town is also the main shopping area for the city, check out Princes Street for High Street staples and parallel George Street for more up-market shops.When you’re ready to swap coffee for a glass of wine, descend the steps into the relaxed and welcoming new wine bar below L’Escargot Bleu on Broughton Street, though a warning, it may be hard to move on from here.For dinner you are spoiled for choice, so I’ll give a few favourites. Noto is the more casual sister restaurant to Aizle, it specialises in small plates without the formality of a set menu. Everything is designed to share . Order the North Sea crab with warm butter and thank me later. The Corra Linn croquettes with truffle are incredible too. It’s a stylish wee place, with putty-coloured walls, branches and greenery.The Palmerston only opened last year, and this bistro and bakery has already claimed a very loyal following. Expect hearty dishes like confit pork belly, Jerusalem artichokes, chard, sage and marsala, or lamb, turnip and potato gratin, anchovy and hispi cabbage. Large pies designed to share make regular appearances on the menu and the wine list is delightful.For a more casual option try Taco Libre for fun and authentic Mexican cooking in a gloriously kitsch technicolor restaurant. Order the fish baja tacos, guacamole, loaded sweetcorn, sopes with refried beans and plenty of napkins. The margaritas are outstanding too.From here the night is yours, will it be descending into the dimly lit The Jazz Bar to see who’s playing tonight  Or catching some stand-up comedy with a pint at The Stand  Or perhaps just a nightcap – in which case relaxed bar The Green Room on William Street is a favourite .gtgt DAY TWOFor this second day, we’ll start in The New Town, and take in Stockbridge, Dean Village and end the day in Leith using the Water of Leith Walkway. This route contains a lot of walking, download the Lothian Bus  Tram app for alternative travel suggestions.First stretch your legs with a quick jaunt up Calton Hill. Many argue this is the best view in Edinburgh as you can see the castle, Arthur’s Seat and Salisbury Crags, and explore the distinctive buildings that dominate the skyline- including Scotland’s National Monument and the City Observatory. You can breakfast on the hillyou book in at The Lookout, which is perched on the side of the hill with incredible floor-to-ceiling windows and equally impressive food.WHEN HUNGER CALLSFrom Calton Hill walk along Princes Street to Frederick Street, then follow it down the hilland then across Circus Place to Stockbridge. Take a left on to Saunders Place to find the Water of Leith Walkway. This is one of the loveliest sections of path so follow it to visit St. Bernard’s Well, ridiculously pretty Dean Village and on to the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art .The gallery has two buildings, Modern One and Modern Two, either side of Belford Road with many sculptures in the gardens too. This is Scotland’s home of modern art and it’s an incredible collection. When hunger calls, either eat in one of the museum cafés orto Stockbridge and take your pick of some superb cafés and pubs for lunch. Fortitude Coffee and Artisan Roast are good options for a casual bite, for something more substantial try Hamilton’s for epic brunch-style dishes or Hector’s for a roast.GORGEOUS GARDENSAfter lunch walk to the Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh, a short stroll from Stockbridge. With a history going back to the th century, these gorgeous gardens are both an important botanical collection and a delight to visit – with over  acres to explore. From the Botanics, exit by the west gate, by the John Hope Gateway and re-find the Water of Leith WalkwayThe path will take you through woodland on the other side of the river to the idyllic Stockbridge Colonies, up to the main road in Canonmills, follow Warriston Road to the next section of path, and then follow signs around St. Marks Park to Leith. . Look out for Anthony Gormley sculptures in the river.Leith is frequently voted one of the coolest neighbourhoods in the world, so spend the evening here and judge for yourself. Home to two Michelin starred restaurants , there are many other fine dining establishments that should also be on your radar.Try Aurora, where a seasonal tasting menu of Modern European cooking awaits, inspired by the extensive culinary travels of head chef Kamil Witek. This intimate little restaurant is on Great Junction Street, not the fashionable Shore, but with the new premises of The Little Chartroom and superb new wine bar Mistral around the corner on Bonnington Road, this part of Leith is definitely on the up.It almost goes without saying that The Little Chartroom should be on your must-visit list too – chef Roberta Hall-McCarron is one of Scotland’s rising culinary stars, unfortunately unless you’re very organised the waiting list for a table is a few months long.If, like me, dining anywhere near the sea has you craving seafood, then head along The Shore where there are two brilliant choices that I’d struggle to choose between. Fisher’s is set in a th Century watchtower with small tables, flawless service, and a buzzing atmosphere. The menu is ied but fish is the main attraction – try Anstruther langoustines, then the Aberdeen halibut with samphire, ham hock, gnocchi and chicken butter sauce.On the same stretch The Ship on the Shore bills itself as a ‘Champagne Bar  Seafood Restaurant’, so that’s the ordering taken care of.For a celebration you can’t beat the towering, impeccably sourced ‘Fruits de Mer’ for a more everyday but still lovely lunch go for Shetland Mussels with ‘ships chips’. It’s an elegant spot with a timeless feel, think dark walls, framed art, gleaming mirrors, and nautical ephemera.The Shore Bar on the same stretch is wonderfully atmospheric and perfect for a nightcap.WELCOMING PUBSIf fine dining isn’t on the menu, then Leith is also home to some top foodie pubs – the ever cheery Roseleaf serves up tasty burgers, flatbreads and mac and cheese.Nobles on Constitution Street punches far above most pub food offerings, with classics like excellent fish and chips, but also surprising and perfectly executed additions like roast rabbit with thyme polenta and roast baby carrots.Eating or otherwise, Roseleaf and Nobles are great pubs to end the evening in too, and to that list I’d add The King’s Wark, Teuchter’s Landing and The Malt and Hops for traditional and welcoming pubs on the Shore Nauticus for a cocktail and The Lioness of Leith for a pint and a bit of a party to end our tour of Scotland’s capital city."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-benedetti-surprise-new-director-edinburgh-international-festival","story":"Benedetti, , will become the first female and the first Scottish Festival Director since the Festival began in .The Grammy and Brit award-winning musician will take up the role in October.

Those affected are being informed. There are further staffing challenges in adult social work and Occupational Therapy.Ms Green continued: “The closure of any service is as a last resort, but we have no choice to ensure we can safely manage to run our residential care facilities. The situation will be monitored closely and as soon as we are in a position to reopen safely then we will let everyone know.“Our care staff and the families of residents have done an outstanding job in keeping this virus at bay and out with our care facilities up until recent times but given the widespread transmission and the reduction in restrictions it has meant it was almost inevitable that this was going to happen at some point.”Staffing challenges are also being felt across the Leisure and Culture service, with some gym and swimming pool sessions and exercise classes being cancelled. The council-run St Magnus Café, Community Centre, and Town Hall have also been affected by closures and reduced opening hours.A plan has been agreed to ensure some level of service continues at the popular cafe during this challenging period and is being trialled this weekuntil the end of March, opening from .-.

This stems from the  Harbours Act which states that any harbour may be open to all for the shipping of goods.“But in my view is this is so very dferent. Can you imagine Churchill complying with Victorian legislation and allowing a vessel owned by a hostile nation into the Flow “We have a proud maritime history in Orkney, and we should play our part and issue an immediate ban on all Russian vessels entering our harbours. This would be a peaceful but very effective act.”Councillor Sankey intends to liaise with OIC officers, his councillor colleagues and politicians early next week to see how this visit can be stopped. He says he can’t condone OIC services of any type assisting the vessel.“Whilst we may by law have to allow access, there’s no law that says our pilot boats and tugs should be used, and I’m deeply unhappy about our harbour assets helping a Russian ship under current circumstances,” adds Councillor Sankey.In a statement provided to The Orcadian on Saturday, Orkney Islands Council said the authority is an “extremely dficult position.”A spokeswoman said: ”We recognise the strength of feeling around this — feelings that we share —  but we are bound by our legal obligations to accept the vessel, until such a time as the UK Government tells us otherwise.“We have sought urgent advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, who have told us that the current sanctions do not cover this operation.”We continue dialogue both with elected representatives and Government departments on this situation as we seek to clary what possible further action can be taken.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

And this is what we can tell the fans, and I think this is what the fans saw on Sunday. vw,vw,px, px\"Thomas Tuchel, pictured, believes Cha can only get on with the day job amid outside concerns like war in Ukraine “There is a big situation out there but there’s a lot of commitment from the players.“Everybody is aware there are more important things, that the situation is by far much more important than a game of football, but still on Sunday there was a full stadium, and still we arrived with two strong teams who played a fantastic match.“And this is what we can do for the fans, to distract them, to entertain them, and do what we do with a maximum effort and a maximum commitment.“I don’t see any other solution for what we could do dferently.”Abramovich made the move to step back from the day-to-day running of Cha in a statement on Saturday, in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.The -year-old took the step in order to protect Cha moving forward, in a move that would not protect the billionaire from any UK government sanctions.The trustees of the Cha Foundation have submitted a serious incident report to the Charity Commission, to seek clarity on how to enact Abramovich’s plans.Abramovich’s spokesperson told the PA news agency on Monday that the businessman is attempting to broker a peaceful solution between Russia and Ukraine.When quizzed on Abramovich’s possible role, Tuchel replied: “Listen, you have to stop, honestly. I’m not a politician. You have to stop.“I can only repeat it, and I even feel bad to repeat it, because I never experienced war.“So even to talk about it, I feel bad, because I’m very privileged, I sit here in peace.“And I do the best I can because you have to stop asking me these questions because I have no answers for you.“You always start the question the same way, saying ‘we know there are much more important things than football but can you comment’.“But you also decide to ask me about war and how often do I need to say it “It’s horrible, of course it’s horrible: there cannot be any other opinion. vw,vw,px, px\"Bruce Buck, pictured, is Cha’s most senior hands-on figure after Roman Abramovich’s step backwards “But why should we be more distracted than you at work  That’s what I mean when I said it in the first place.“Of course it’s out there and we know there are more important things out there, and this will never change.“But this is about sports, and there are a lot of more important things out there.“And still there is a huge distraction now going on and we are worried.“But at the end, we still try to create an atmosphere to come to work and focus on our work which is our passion and we are very, very grateful and very privileged to have it.“And it’s not that big a problem. But I think everybody in Europe, more or less, has some noise in their heads that nobody likes.“Maybe it’s the same for you but still you try to do your job as best as possible, and it’s the same for us.https:www.chafc en news    statement-from-club-owner-roman-abramovich utm_sourcetwutm_mediumorgsocutm_campaignnone“For me as a coach and in charge of the first team that decisiondoes not change too much the daily business.“Because I’m in the daily exchange with Petr Cech and very regular exchange with Marina , about how to improve the first team.“And this will not stop because they stay in charge.“But the role from Mr Abramovich is not on me to comment, because I simply don’t know enough about it.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Harland  Wolff on Monday night said it will “continue to support the UK Government’s position”, following Transport Secretary Grant Schapps’ call for all UK ports to deny access to Russian flagged, registered or operated vessels.Mr Shapps tweeted on Monday: “Given Putin’s action in Ukraine I’ve made clear these vessels are NOT welcome here with prohibiting legislation to follow.”In a letter to UK ports, he said the maritime sector “must play our part” in sanctioning Russia over Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Russia’s assault on Ukraine is an unprovoked, premeditated attack against a sovereign democratic state. The UK Government has been clear there would be massive consequences and a severe cost for any Russian military incursion into Ukraine, and, in co-ordination with our international allies and partners, we are developing an unprecedented package of further sanctions,” he said.“The maritime sector is fundamental to international trade and we must play our part in restricting Russia’s economic interests and holding the Russian government to account.“In these circumstances the Department for Transport does not consider it appropriate for Russian vessels to continue to enter UK ports.“From this point onwards, UK ports are asked not to provide access to any ship which they have reason to believe is: owned, controlled, chartered, or operated by any person connected with Russia owned, controlled, chartered or operated by designated persons flying the Russian flag registered in Russia.“We will seek to support UK ports in identying Russian ships within scope of the above and will communicate directly with relevant ports when we identy ships bound for UK ports who fall within scope of the above.“Further detailed sanctions against Russian shipping are being developed and further details will be shared very shortly.”Harland  Wolff said in a statement to the Belfast : “We are aware of a request issued by the Department for Transport instructing UK ports not to provide access to any ship which is owned or controlled by any person connected with Russia, flying the Russian flag or registered in Russia.“Harland  Wolff has a long tradition of working with UK Government and will continue to support the UK Government’s position.”It is unclear whether the UK Government’s request only concerns incoming Russian vessels, or also those already docked or undergoing repairs.It is also unclear whether or not the Eduard Toll — which measures up at a signicant draught of .m and aof m — we be allowed to leave the Belfast dock amid the current climate.Harland  Wolff’s Belfast shipyard is the site of one of Europe’s largest heavy engineering facilities with deep-water access, and also two of Europe’s largest dry docks. The famous shipyard was saved from closure back in  after being acquired by UK-based energy company Infrastrata. Following the acquisition of Harland  Wolffin August , the firm has focused on opportunities in both ship repair and shipbuilding.Related topicsUkraineMore On UkraineNI writers to stage special fundraiser in show of solidarity with Ukrainian peersNI Nobel Prize winner Mairead Maguire opposes ‘punishment’ and military action against Russia PremiumViewpointOpinionHow we can all help the people fleeing Ukraine PremiumMalachi O#DohertyOpinionThere will always be wars, our only hope they’re not nuclear PremiumSam McBrideOpinionUkraine crisis: Nuclear conflict with Russia is too terrible to contemplate, but during Cold War we planned for ArmageddonMost ReadLisburn luxury property oozing modern style includes home gymContent warning: #Show this to Putin#, six-year-old’s final moments following Russian shelling of MariupolFate of tanker in Belfast uncertain after ports told Russian vessels not welcomeBallymacbreenan Schoolhouse: Dream Lisburn home was well worth the -year waitBelfast streets closed after partial collapse of wall in city centreTop VideosPlayFuel prices in Northern Ireland are at an all time high following the Russian invasion of Ukraine\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news c .ece AUTOCROP wh defcbaee.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news c .ece AUTOCROP wh defcbaee.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Explosion at ATM in north BelfastPlayMother of Noah Donohoe delivers petition to release files on son#s deathLatest Northern IrelandInvasion of Ukraine may ‘lead to food shortages this year’, says Poots as -mile-long Russian military convoy advances on KyivInvasion of Ukraine may ‘lead to food shortages this year’Edwin Poots ‘unaware’ of Donaldson-Beattie meetingBill creating ‘safe spaces’ around abortion clinics set for Assembly debateOne of competing climate change bills passes penultimate NI Assembly hurdleLatestWilliam and Kate reveal they are ‘getting children involved in farming’Charli XCX teasesto Saturday Night Live after ’emotional’ cancellationRaith send controversial striker David Goodwillie back to Clyde on loanTyson Fury: Showdown with Dillian Whyte biggest British bout since Lewis v TysonTV tower in Kyiv hit by several explosions, Ukraine parliament says,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I therefore secured £million which will ensure , eligible people and families will see payments of £ starting to be received into bank accounts next week.”SDLP Communities Spokesperson Mark H Durkan welcomed the announcement of a date but criticised theof time the payments have taken.He said it was “regrettable” the payments were being made closer to Spring as opposed to Winter.“Families have been crying out for this support for months, we have just come through a very cold period and now as the weather is beginning to turn people will finally get this money,” Mr Durkan said.“I have pressed the Minister consistently since the scheme was announced in early January for a payment date.“No answer was forthcoming, instead many people were forced to make it through the winter with no support while they were unable to heat their homes.“While it will help people in the short-term we have seen from the rising cost of heating bills that it will only be a sticking plaster approach at best.Read MoreUkraine crisis will lead to increase in energy costs, Lyons warns“While I accept that many of the causes of this dire situation are outside our control, there is more we can be doing to support people here and mitigate these price increases.“Quite frankly, this payment comes too little too late. The Minister had promised that payments would be made by early February yet two months since the scheme was announced, this money is not in the pockets of hard-pressed iniduals and their families.”People will be eligible for payments from the energy schemeduring the qualying week of Monday December  to Sunday December  they were in receipt of one or more of the following benefits: Pension Credit, Universal Credit, Income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Income-based Jobseekers Allowance, or Income Support.Ms Hargey added: “This much needed support of £million is in addition to schemes we already have in place.These include the Affordable Warmth and Boiler Replacement Schemes, Cold Weather Payments, Discretionary Support and the Winter Fuel Payment which has paid out over £million this winter to more than , older people. My department also provided a £million contribution to an Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme, operated by Bryson Care.“During these dficult times I would encourage people to contact the Department’s Make the Call service which is in place to connect people with the benefits, supports and services to which they are entitled.

Craig Harkness, Ross Connolly and Darren Cassells on the wings were making super tackles when required, while Andrew Mullholand kept the opposition outside the circle.Bangor won a short corner, but Ballynahinch kept the ball out and go on the attack. Leslie Harrison found Alex Millar and he passed the ball to Hugo Melville who attacked up the right hand side before being stopped in his tracks.Before the end of the first quarter Bangor ed to the lsquoHinch circle and took the lead with a tap-in at the back post.With both sides now settled in, the second quarter was full of end to end action. Matthew Martin made a break through the Bangor defence and passed the ball to forward Jason Campbell who won a short corner. Bangor were able to stop the Hinch drag flick from the top of the circle.With Bangor on the front foot and looking to increase their lead they applied the pressure on lsquoHinch. They moved the ball around looking for an opening and went further in front with a shot which came off the back board.lsquoHinch kept the heads and created chances, but they couldnrsquot stop Bangor going - in front.In the third quarter Ballynahinch kept trying to get on the score sheet with Ashley Brown, Andrew Mulholland, Leslie Harrison and Alex Millar all working hard.Hinch started to creep up the pitch and Matthew Martin created a channel for the ball to be fired up to Jason Campbell, whose attempted pass to Michael Carney was unfortunately intercepted.Bangor were able to create several chances in the Hinch circle, only to be stopped by keeper Aaron Donnell, Ashley Brown and Andrew Mulholland. However, they added another goal to the scoreline with a well-placed shot.In the final quarter Hinch broke through the Bangor defence and Craig Harkness narrowly missed pulling a goal back.Bangor were on the attack for most of the closing stages and forced a series of short corners which were kept out as lsquoHinch put every player behind the ball.However, a well placed pass across the circle narrowly missing every Hinch stic and was deflected in at the back post.As Bangor continued to attack, a drag flick from the top of the circle was deflected over the crossbar by keeper Donnell and a number of late short corners and further attempts on goal were kept out by stout defending from Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison, Matthew Martin and Alex Millar.Player of the match: Ashley Brown.The club wishes to thank the Primrose, Ballynahinch, for their continued sponsorship..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Bhoys batter Carryduff in goal feast at Ballyhornan  ","story":"CELTIC Bhoys breezed through the adverse weather conditions to remain in the hunt for the league title as they swept aside a depleted Carryduff outfit at Ballyhornan on Saturday.Hat-tricks apiece for Celtic marksmen Sean McMahon and Jordan McCoubrey helped the Hoops to an emphatic victory on a weekend when plenty of other fixtures suffered postponement as a result of Storm Eunice.The away side only travelled with a total of  players and so immediately were at a disadvantage as the hosts knew they could call upon their benchneeded.With this in mind, Celtic attacked the opposition from the outset with strike partners McCoubrey and McMahon linking up on numerous occasions within the opening minutes.It didnrsquot take long for the home side to find the back of the net after Barry Treacy lofted a pin-point pass on to the head of McMahon, who steered his effort past Carryduff lsquokeeper Conor Leggett.Although often pressed back into their own half, Carryduff were determined to make a go of it and knew they had to make the most of their seldom opportunities.Midfielder Ciaran Conway saw his free-kick glide gracefully into the arms of Celtic custodian Nathan Curran, before McMahon was again causing problems at the other end.This time he saw his headed effort ruled out for offside. This was a warning sign of things to come as just moments later McCoubrey managed to put the ball into the net courtesy of the outside of his right boot after a scramble in the box.Again, Carryduff showed their resilience and still relied on their counterattacks, the latest coming from captain Conway, although his misjudged pass denied team-mate David Quigley a chance at goal.The pressure would continue to mount on the Carryduff back line and soon it was - as McCoubrey registered his second of the match mdash albeit through an unorthodox but neat finish.Celtic defender Blaine Connolly saw his effort fantastically thwarted by Carryduff lsquokeeper Leggett, who pounced to the bottom right corner of his net with a strong outstretched arm to deny further punishment.The weather began to give its input into the game as temperatures ped bitterly and the wind began to blow harshly at intervals.Although this cannot be cited as the determining factor in this contest by any stretch of the imagination, it certainly played its part when Carryduffrsquos Emmet Curran saw his through ball carried beyond its intended target.Carryduff did manufacture a rare breakaway and it looked asstriker Jonathan Wilkinson would open the away sidersquos account when a pass from midfield left him with just lsquokeeper Curran to beat.However, an impressive last-ditch tackle from defender Gary Carberry allowed the Celtic number five to hook the ball to safety, thus further frustrating the opposition.Celticrsquos Shaun Megahey saw his left-footed effort saved before Carryduffrsquos Joseph McBrien swept up the loose ball and in the last notable action of the half, Conway witnessed his lowly struck effort palmed away from danger by the Hoopsrsquo number one.As the second half kicked off, the home side showed no signs of relenting as they pushed for more goals.Conaill Kerr saw his point-blank effort superbly saved from six yards by lsquokeeper Leggett, who, despite the score line, made numerous contributions to prevent his side conceding into double figures.This over-eagerness from the hosts would cost them as they were caught short at the back, leaving Raymond Grant unmarked  yards from goal.The striker quickly picked his spot and unleashed a lovely curled effort into the top right hand corner to get his side off the mark.Unfortunately for Carryduff, this was as good as it got as Celtic replied almost immediately with McMahon grabbing his second of the matchafter rounding the lsquokeeper for an easy tap in.Things went from bad to worse for the away team when Stephen Galbraith slipped a pass into the path of team-mate Conaill Kerr, who made no mistake with his finish in the one-on-one scenario.At this point Carryduff were aiming for damage limitation but Celtic smelt blood. McMahon completed his hat-trick with an eye-catching acrobatic effort before McCoubrey, tapped in his third of the day.Hoops defender Carberry picked up a yellow card after some unsavoury words with the official and captain Michael Rice was left red-faced after midfielder Curran knocked the ball between his legs, but the home outfit didnrsquot let that deter them from their onslaught.Carberry atoned for his booking in the form of a late header from a Galbraith corner delivery to round off the scoring at -.After the match, hat-trick hero Sean McMahon gave his thoughts on his sidersquos resounding victory.ldquoIt was a good performance, he said. ldquoWe knew they only had  players so we had a good chance of winning but you have to play the  minutes and make sure you get the victory at the end of the day.ldquoWersquove put pressure on the league leaders, itrsquos good to score three goals but the main thing is to get the three points.He added: ldquoI donrsquot usually score headers so thatrsquos my pick of the goals for me.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, B Connolly, R Fitzpatrick, G Carberry, M Rice , B Treacy, C McCartan, S McMahon, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.

The Gill brothers, Gareth and Kyle, were among the replacements.Ballynahinch used the conditions superbly to burst into a lead they would not surrender.Playing with the wind, they pinned the students back with excellent tactical kicking and after missing an early long range penalty they went for the corner following a UCC offence at the breakdown and Kyle McCall burst from the edge of the maul to score.A great kick and chase moments later led to another penalty and another maul try for McCall. Greg Hutleyrsquos superb conversion took Ballynahinch  points clear after  minutes.The second quarter yielded only a single UCC penalty. Ballynahinch were not quite as accurate as they had been earlier in the game and small errors and indiscipline allowed UCC plenty of possession. However, excellent defence and long clearing kicks meant that the Ballynahinch line was never threatened.The second half was a scrappy affair and Ballynahinch began to fall foul of the referee at the breakdown.UCC kicked a long range penalty to close the gap to six points and missed another moments later as Ballynahinch struggled to put phases together into the wind.

Ballynahinch piled on the pressure, carrying hard at the line and desperate UCC defence led to another penalty and a yellow card for their replacement prop.The game was now there for the taking and following another big scrum on the UCC line Ballynahinch tried to put Conor Rankin over on the blind side.Multiple phases later UCC looked to have weathered the storm when they stole the ball and kicked clear. A superb chase saw Ballynahinch caught in possession but Cairns made an excellent arcing run to scythe through the cover and head for the line.He was tackled just short but the supporting Hutley was on hand to barge over, taking a knock in the process.He recovered to slot the conversion, sending Ballynahinch  points clear going intothe last five minutes and they saw out the game in relative comfort.Celebrations lasted long into the night and Ballynahinch have now put daylight between themselves and UCC.Third from bottom UCD arrive at Ballymacarn Park on Saturday to take on a rejuvenated local outfit who now have a snf of avoiding the relegation play-off.

The design was rejected by the council.The campaign started last May when contractors turned up with equipment and portacabins and marked the trees for felling.Local resident Lily Devlin noticed the development and started the campaign, first rallying support via her Facebook page, and then starting an online petition.Speaking on behalf of the Save the Trees Campaign group, Cathie McKimm said: ldquoThe council got this wrong from the beginning.ldquoWe now have a situation where the council are applying for planning permission for a project they have already appointed contractors for and the project has increased by almost % in cost.ldquoIn bringing in experts to late at a huge cost to the ratepayer to fix the many mistakes theyrsquove made, including failing to include a drainage system in a flood risk area, the council are now having to contribute more than pound, to this scheme and growing, whereas before they were only contributing approximately pound, for the same scheme. ldquoGiven all the conflicts of interest that the council now have we do not believe they can assess this planning application objectively, and believe that the Department of Infrastructure needs to call it in and conduct a full investigation about how this has been handled.A council spokesman confirmed that a planning application for the project would follow regulations which apply to all councils throughout Northern Ireland in making its decision.He said: ldquoThe council will let matters follow due process, mindful of the procedures put in place by the Department for such planning applications.He also confirmed that the project, which was planned as a local tourism boost, had increased in costs.ldquoThe council has applied for and obtained funding of pound, towards the project. At the start of the regeneration scheme, the proposed costs were circa pound,, he said.ldquoHowever, with the passage of time, increased construction costs and refinement of the scheme , the costs were last estimated at circa pound, which was agreed by council in October .A DfI spokesperson confirmed it had initially considered making a preservation order on the trees.He added: ldquoHowever, on January  , the council confirmed that it had instead opted to submit a planning application. This was lodged on December  to the Planning Service of the council. The necessity of whether it is expedient to complete the process of making a TPO is on hold pending the outcome of the planning application..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Smell wind of change as lambs leap around fields  ","story":"IT is spring again in Lecale and new le abounds in the fields. Daffodils are peaking out of the ground, the weather is softening, and the feast of St Brigidrsquos Day , February , has passed.This can mean only one thing ndash lambs! In fact, lambs have been born in our practice since before Christmas. But the majority will be coming to a field near you over the next few weeks.Now, modern flocks have a lot of sheep in them. Indeed, there are about five million sheep in Ireland overall. Thatrsquos one for every man, woman and child.Our domestic sheepis descended from a primitive European ancestor, today found mainly in Corsica. In the past it was common for sheep to havejust one lamb. But today, thanks to better feeding, shelter and shepherding, it is possible for sheep to have twins, triplets and even quads!This abundance can come with problems though. Whata sheep doesnrsquot have enough milk to feed this many lambs  Well, farmers have come up with a number of solutions.The first is lsquopet lambsrsquo. These lambs are hand reared. They are fed with a bottle using condensed milk from commercial suppliers. Or the milk can be taken from another ewe who is producing a lot.As anyone with a baby will tell you, this solution is labour intensive and will keep the shepherd working around the clock. But they are dedicated, and they do it! It is not always sustainable in the long run. Another solution is fostering.Lamb fostering is where a ewe adopts the lamb from another ewe. The reasons for fostering can be manold. A lack of milk is one of the major reasons. The ewe may not want to take on another lamb, not recognising it as her own, but shepherds have adapted one of naturersquos many wonders to encourage it to happen.They use a technique called olfactory imprinting. Have you ever wondered how a ewe can recognise her own lamb in a flock of hundreds  One reason is that, just after birth, the ewe learns the smell of her newborn. This is what olfactory imprinting means.Shepherds can take advantage of this amazing process by rubbing some of the birthing fluid of the newborn lamb into the wool of the lamb to be fostered. The ewe will then accept the lamb as one of her own, and feed and care for it. The lives of many lambs are saved in this way.So when you next look at the fields of Lecale, check out the sheep and seeyou can tell them apart. Evenyou canrsquot, their mums can!.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ulster Aviation Society left ‘dismayed’ over council at Festival of Flight decision  ","story":"THE decision by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to cancel this summerrsquos international Festival of Flight in Newcastle was taken without consulting one of its key partners, it has emerged.Last weekrsquos decision to pull the plug on the event mdash which was last held in  mdash was taken in secret during a meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Tourist and Regeneration Committee.It is understood that no contact was made with the Ulster Aviation Society which has played a major role since the inaugural festival and described its disappointment at the cancellation decision.Regularly attracting in the region of , people to the resort in the summer, the flagship tourist event has been a major success for over a decade.Council officials say that due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the pandemic, organising this yearrsquos event would not be possible.Some councillors believe that given the local authorityrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades in Downpatrick and Newry are set to go ahead next month and with the further easing of Covid regulations, some form of airshow could have been organised for Newcastle this summer.This week, Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis urging the council to confirm that next yearrsquos festival will go ahead.The Ulster Aviation Society said it was ldquodisappointed and dismayed about the cancellation of the airshow and the fact that the organisation had not been consulted.Society chairman Ray Burrows said it was ldquoastonishing that the event had been ldquoshot down in secret, with no reasonable explanation.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has urged the local council to ldquograsp the opportunity and organise an alternative event, suggesting a large scale festival that incorporates and builds on the most popular elements of the Festival of Flight.He is keen to see an event showcasing the regionrsquos ldquooutstanding food and drink offering with Newcastle a designated venue for arts, culture and music events to create opportunities showcasing the entrepreneurial spirit and pioneering innovation of the district.Mr Burrows said while these were ldquoall excellent suggestions, he said as elements in addition to, or within, the Festival of Flight, surely not as a replacement for it.He continued: ldquoThat said, we would be pleased indeed to meet with the council or the mayor to discuss the matter. We want to help Newcastle demonstrate in a powerful, popular way how important our aviation future and heritage are to Northern Ireland.ldquoThatrsquos exactly what did in recent years, before Covid.ldquoWe [the UAS] had probably the most popular exhibition within the ground-based event and thousands of parents have brought their children for photographs in our Spitfire and our Alouette helicopter, at no charge.Mr Burrows suggested that unless the councilrsquos decision is reversed, or at least re-assessed, he expects there will be tremendous disappointment from the public.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic it was also grounded.Urging the local authority to confirm that it will be chocks away for next summerrsquos Festival of Flight, Cllr Lewis said that for the past two years, the organisation has been unable to deliver a tourism events programme due to the impact of Covid-.ldquoAlthough the possible impact of future Covid iants is dficult to predict, it is hoped that larger scale events can resume this summer. This will be a welcome boost to residents and the local trade and hospitality sectors, he continued.ldquoCouncil research indicates that almost poundm was generated in  for the district as a direct result of tourism events. Therefore, it is bitterly disappointing that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight will not be going ahead.Cllr Lewis said the income that it would have generated would be a welcome boost to traders in the town and benefit the collective tourism industry across South Down.He continued: ldquoWe must not underestimate the huge draw of this annual festival. I note that council officers have said that throughout this past  months they had continued to engage with key stakeholders including the RAF.ldquoIt was advised that due to challenges planning the festival, securing air assets and the uncertainty of the pandemic that it has not been possible to host the festival of flight this year.Cllr Lewis revealed that he has been contacted by many aviation enthusiasts who are bitterly disappointed that the festival wonrsquot go ahead.He added: ldquoI fail to see how the event couldnrsquot have at least been planned for later in the year, now that we know the majority of restrictions are to be lted. I am asking the council to alleviate fears by confirming that the Festival of Flight hasnrsquot be shelved. Every effort must be made to ensure this wonderful attraction be ed to Newcastle which has been its home for  years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13526073.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This will y from congregation to congregation with regard to the timing and details of it.”However, Mr Greer stressed that as a denomination his church is fully aware that the pandemic virus is still within society. “Therefore, we will endeavour to proceed with care in the removal of remaining mitigations. For example, we will also show respect and liberty toward those who wish to continue wearing face coverings, either entering or leaving our buildings or while seated for worship.“Our worship services are open to all – our own members and adherents, and also any from the public at large who wish to visit. We must emphasise our gratitude to the Lord for His mercy in bringing us to this point where church le is more back to full ministry at all levels.”• The Free Presbyterian general presbytery, in a statement this week, said: “We give thanks to God for looking upon the nation in mercy, and withdrawing the more extreme symptoms of the covid pandemic, which caused death and serious illness. “We are grateful for removal of all statutory restrictions upon our public worship and have authorised our sessions and committees to take the necessary steps, transitioning our people back to normality. We continue to pray for all who have been affected by the pandemic through bereavement and illness and that they will know God’s grace and comfort.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Prior to being in Lurgan, the organisation’s administrative base was located in Dublin and Belfast.The Royal Black moved out of Brownlow House in  to temporary premises in Loughgall, beside the Museum of Orange Heritage at Sloan’s House.Now, the institution is looking forward to taking up residence in their own purpose-built administrative centre.“The opening of our new headquarters will be a landmark day in the history of the Royal Black Institution,” said Rev Anderson.“This project has been one of the biggest and most important ever undertaken by the Imperial Grand Black Chapter of the British Commonwealth.“The need for our own headquarters was discussed and agreed in , we purchased the Loughgall building in , renovation work began in May , and I’m delighted to say we’re ready to cut the ribbon on Saturday, April .“It has been a long road to get to this point, and there have been many challenges along the way. “We had originally hoped to open the building in , so that the unveiling would form part of our celebrations for the centenary of Northern Ireland. However, the Covid pandemic wreaked havoc with our work schedule. But we were fairly relaxed about the delay as our focus was always about completing the building to a high standard rather than rushing to a completion date.“There are so many people to thank for all their hard work but I would like to take this opportunity to pay special tribute to the contractors, Weir Bros Construction, for their professionalism and attention to detail, and to our own clerk of works, Edgar Patterson, and quantity surveyor, Keith Anderson, and the entire Royal Black HQ project team, for their passion, commitment and expertise over the last few years.“Thanks to the efforts of everyone involved, we now have modern headquarters from which we can proudly maintain our stand for the Reformed Faith and strengthen our Christian and charitable outreach.”The building itself has an interesting history. At one stage it was a public house known as the Rock Tavern. Afterwards, a temperance advocate, Cecilia Cope, turned it into a coffee house. A later inhabitant was Field Marshal Sir Gerald Templer, a senior British Army officer and former chief of the Imperial General Staff, who fought in both world wars. In more recent times it housed a popular antiques business.The grand opening will also include the opening of a ‘Leaders’ Legacy’ exhibition on the lives of past sovereign grand masters, and the unveiling and dedication of a bust of Sir Norman Stronge.

It was silly, but to give Jimmy his due there was always a wee message in it, just like the work I do with the Gang today. “Always, each side of the community got an equal send up, again just like what we do with Give My Head Peace. It was all very even.“At that time I was still working in the court house for Antrim County Council because in those days, unless you were wealthy, actors could never afford to give up their day jobs. You were in the performing arts for the love of it.Olivia and her late husband Bill whom she married on June , . The couple went on to have one daughter, Patricia“I would come out of the court house like the clappers and get a bus up Royal Avenue to the Group Theatre. Sometimes we would do double shows for three weeks over Easter and over Christmas, but it was so much fun, you didn’t resent being so busy.“Every six months we changed the show, but when we would do two shows, the same people who were into theatre would be sitting there every single Saturday. People would come to the play at half six, go to John Long’s fish and chip shop for their tea and then sometimes be back in time for the second performance.”Olivia recalls that the love of her le, her late husband Bill, whom she met through the Larne Drama Circle, died of an aneurysm in .“Bill and I were always trying to get married, and I would say, ‘I’ll just do another play, Bill, and then we’ll get married.’ Olivia as a cherubic child. She began elocution lessons at the tender age of three and has been performing in one way or another ever since“We got married on June , , and got a flat, and we put every penny we got into it, and we just thought we were the bees’ knees. “Then in August of ‘ internment came in and absolutely everything stopped, the city went dark and the curtains came down in the theatres. No plays, nothing, and there was Bill and I sitting like two prunes, albeit in love.“There’s not a day goes by when I don’t miss him, but after his death I had to raise my daughter Patricia who was just ten then, and le had to go on. My love of acting sustained me.”She first joined Tim ‘and the boys’ on BBC NI’sPerforated Ulster and then came the call to join the cast of Give My Head Peace for what would go on to become the now iconic satirical series in  and ever since nobody has dared cross, or targe, the inimitable doyenne of the dramedy.‘I’M ACTUALLY VERY SHY OUTSIDE A ROLE’“At age three I was signed up to do elocution lesson,” says Olivia. “I was always used to standing up and speaking.“Basically though, and people may be very surprised by this, but I am actually very shy, and I hate going into rooms with people who I don’t really know, because I always think, ‘well why would they want to talk to me ’ “So I was always nervous, but I never had any qualms about going on stage and I always did a lot of public speaking.“At first, when I started to do it, I used to pretend that I was somebody , for about the first two minutes and that’s what got me through.“With drama you can be very shy, but when you take on a role you become somebody , and there’s a real liberation in that because you no longer feel self-conscious - you are transformed when you play a particular part.”Nash added: “When I left school, I joined Larne Drama Circle at the age of  and it was the making of me as a performer and to this day all of us are like family, my family outside my family - %.”‘IF YOU CAN MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH TOGETHER, THAT’S REALLY OVERCOMING DIVISION’Olivia, who starred in the iconic Billy Plays in the s alongside a very young Sir Kenneth Branagh and the late Jimmy Ellis, whom she remembers as an “absolute gentleman”, received her MBE in  not just for the rich tapestry of her theatre work but also for her uwavering support for the Northern Ireland Hospice for whom she has gone on innumerable fundraising walks and loves to visit to chat and entertain patients. She feels all of us could learn some perspective, namely “how to stop grumbling about things that don’t matter”, from witnessing the incredible work they do there.But today she feels blessed beyond measure, that besides working in radio which allows her to play a “tall, slim blonde” when she feels like it, she is delighted to be part of a show that frequently flags up the absurdity of our sectarian politics and entrenched, ludicrous ision where we could have unity and fraternity.”No disrespect to Stormont, butthe cast of Give My Head Peace had a half an hour up there, I think it would get politicians on both sides of the ide working together much better. “If I had a pound for all the times people stop me in the street and tell me how much Give My Head Peace made them laugh and upllted them, whatever circumstances they were going through, I would be very rich, and I feel very privilegedto have been allowed to be a part of something so wonderful, which I think very much shows that whether you are orange, green or neither, there is so much more that unites rather than ides us in Northern Ireland. “There is barely a day when somebody doesn’t shout out ‘Ma!’ to me in the street.”It’s obvious the gang are thick as thieves and Olivia tells an hilarious story about a programme special they did on the continent when she fell a*** over face into a freezer trying to retrieve some prawns, with a passerby having to pull her out by the ankles, which became comedy gold in one episode, and on a special set in Rome when they had the full humour of Uncle Billy wanting to meet the Pope.How does Ma keep Da in line, I wonder  “Oh that’s my secret,” laughs Olivia. “Da gives her a hard time, but, as in so many households, it all runs off Ma like water off a duck’s back.\u2028“You know I’ve a fabulous family, great friends and an acting career that allows me to do one of the most wonderful things, which is to make people laugh even in the midst of their own personal struggles and to be able to spread joy.“And to me the arts and comedy deserve more respect than they are often afforded, becauseyou can make people laugh together, that’s really overcoming ision.”‘IF I HAD A MAGIC WAND, I’D MAKE EDUCATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND INTEGRATED’Olivia, who calls Dame Judi Dench her ultimate acting inspiration, not only because of the incredible range that has allowed her to do everything from Shakespeare to the Bond franchise but also because she seems “so lovely” in interviews, recalls being repeatedly in trouble at school because she was simply born a very chatty and bubbly livewire.“I was at school in the days of the slap, as it were, and I had lots of them. I hold my hands up, I was always talking too much in class.”After joining Larne Drama Circle at  she was involved in so many dferent productions and drama festivals, appearing in comedies and plays like Brian Friel’s The Loves of Cass McGuire, Tea in a China Cup and even musicals. “Our church had a very strong music society and I cannot sing for peanuts. If I joined a choir, they would pay me to leave, probably. “But one year we did The Music Man I played Mrs Paroo. It was like speak-sing, you spoke it to the beat. We went to Waterford for the festival of light opera and I actually won a prize for best comedienne and to this day I can’t stop laughing about that or marvelling at how it actually came about. “The next year, we did Brigadoon, and I had a part as Meg Brockie, and one of her songs was My Mother’s Wedding Day, and I won a prize that year as well!”If Olivia had a magic wand and could change anything at all about Northern Ireland over night, she would like to see integrated education implemented here.“I remember growing up in Larne, being wheeled about with my friend in a buggy. She was a Protestant, and she was my best friend. Then, because I was a Catholic, she and I had to go to dferent schools when we got older, and I could never understand it.”Olivia added:“We should be together and everybody should be allowed to follow whatever religion they want to follow without it being a question of you being right and the other person being wrong, or anyone trying to impose their beliefs on anybody . “We need to have mutual respect for each other and I think integrated education is the way forward in trying to make that a reality.”See Give My Head Peace  on tour on March -, at the Market Place Theatre, Armagh March , at the Alley Theatre, Strabane March , at The McNeill Theatre, Larne March -, at the Riverside Theatre, Coleraine March , at the Strule Arts Centre, Omagh March -, at the Millennium Forum, Londonderry March , at the Theatre at the Mill, Newtownabbey March , at The Braid, Ballymena March -, at The Ardhowen Theatre, Enniskillen March -, at the Burnavon Theatre, Cookstown and March -April , at the Grand Opera House, Belfast.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The issue was raised in the council’s monthly meeting on Thursday, where Chief Executive Adrian McCreesh said the matter was drawn to his attention before it was due to take place.“The policy itself is very clear, in our view, that it extends only to the hire of facilities and the rooms therein,” he told councillors.“It is silent about outdoor and open recreational space as these areas are normally open to the public and open to public access and use, where bookings are not required.”The council had issued a statement in advance advising that anyone wishing to rearrange their booking for the observatory would be facilitated.The council advised the News Letter that the policy on using indoor council facilities for party political events had been subjected to a compulsory equality impact assessment. The chief executive had told councillors they may want to review it so that it might also apply outdoors, it added.

Mr Poots narrowly defeated Sir Jeffrey in the first ever DUP leadership contest in the party’s  year history. This had followed an internal party coup that ousted Arlen Foster as DUP leader and forced her out of the post as First Minister of Northern Ireland.Sir Jeffrey has repeated his claim this week that it was “nonsense” to report that he was about to defect to the UUP. The current DUP leader denied he ever contemplated leaving the party and going back to the Ulster Unionists whom he left back in .“On the issue of rejoining, matters went no further as I determined that I was not rejoining the UUP,” Sir Jeffrey said.But Mr Beattie insisted on Monday evening that there was “no ambiguity” about the agenda of their meeting at Thiepval Army barracks last year. Mr Beattie challenged Sir Jeffrey to answer a number of questions relating to his decision to agree to their discussion.“Who did he tell he was meeting me  Did his party know  Did his chairman know  Did his Westminster colleagues or first minister know  If nobody knew then why ”Jeffrey DonaldsonEdwin PootsDoug BeattieDUPFirst Minister  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular motorists ‘engaged in anti-social behaviour’ in NI townWhere to drop off items in Northern Ireland to help refugees who are fleeing UkraineSinn Fein event at forest park ‘put off ratepayers’ from using facility, says UUPOil prices NI: Why are home heating oil prices rising across Northern Ireland WATCH: Ukrainian forces are now armed with new ‘built in Belfast’ NLAW anti-tank bazookasMost PopularBest sleeping bags for camping UK : high-spec sleeping bags from Snugpak, Trespass, and Jack WolfskinBest Aldi dupes : top perfume, skincare, beauty, makeup, cleansing balm products from Lacura to le CreusetBest baby car seats UK : best toddler car seats from birth to , including Maxi Cosi, Halfords, CybexBest pancake pans UK : from non-stick to cast iron, these pans will produce perfect pancakes every timeBest women’s walking trousers for hiking : hiking trousers reviewed, from Arc-Teryx, Jack Wolfskin, Acai                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityHorse riding, docking boats and dedicated benches will all become more expensivethe council’s budget proposals are voted through on Thursday, March .Elsewhere, the budget involves raising council tax by . per cent and investing millions in local public services.Most of the council’s income comes from Welsh Government grants and council tax, but a large amount also comes from charging fees for certain services across the city.Some fees are increasing, based on a review of costs and market conditions. Here’s a list of all the key fees and charges set to rise at the start of the next financial year in April.Dedicated benches will increase from £ to £., and dedication trees will increase from £ to £.Beach hut booking fees will increase. During summer renting a large beach hut for a full day will go from £. to £., and for a half day from £. to £ while a small beach hut will increase from £ to £. for a full day and £. to £. for a half day. Annual passes for large huts will go from £ to £., and small huts from £ to £..Two excursion boats which stop at Penarth will have to pay much more to dock at Penarth Pier. The Waverly is an old paddle steamer, while the Balmoral is a pleasure steamer. Both boats currently pay £. in docking charges, but this will increase to £ on weekdays, £ on Saturdays and £ on Sundays.At Cosmeston Lakes, launching boats, riding horses, and orienteering will increase in price. Tours around the Mediaeval Village will also increase slightly in price. Horse riding and orienteering will also increase in price at Porthkerry Country Park. The price of getting married at all three venues remains the same at £,.Last year the Vale council controversially brought in new charges for cafes and restaurants to have outdoor tables and chairs. Their aim is to limit how much space some cafes take up on the pavement, “decluttering” town centres across the Vale, but businesses some objected to the fees. These fees, for ‘public furniture’, will not increase in April..removeCharges for bowling greens are no longer set by the council, as these were transferred over to bowling green clubs.Details of all the planned increases were revealed in a cabinet report. The council’s cabinet will meet on Monday, February , to sign off the budget proposals before they go to the full council for approval on March .The cabinet report said: “As public funding becomes increasingly constrained and under more intense scrutiny, greater emphasis has to be placed upon self-generated income and developing and presenting products and services that will resonate with paying customers.“As revenue budgets have reduced in recent years, income from fees and charges becomes ever more important as a way of sustaining priority services.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We will continue to consider the latest scientic and medical evidence to inform our approach.“Later this week I will be setting our longer term plans to manage the pandemic, as we carry out the regular three-week review of the regulations.”What has changed From Monday, February , face coverings are no longer required in most indoor public places – excluding shops, on public transport, and in health and care settings.However, the Welsh Government continues to “strongly recommend” wearing face coverings, even in places where it is no longer a legal requirement.What is the law in Wales You must wear face coverings in retail premises, health and social care settings and on public transport.For mixed-use areas, including where food or drink is consumed in part of a premises where a face covering is still legally required – such as a department store cafe, or hospital restaurant – you must wear face coverings on the premises, except in the area set aside for eating and drinking.Where do I not have to wear a face covering .removeMost indoor public settings no longer require people to wear a face covering in Wales.These include:In hospitality settings such as pubs or nightclubsGyms, fitness and sports centres Community centresLeisure and entertainment venues, such as cinema, theatre, concert hall, bowling alleys, or bingo hallsAt a wedding, civil partnership or alternative wedding ceremony or receptionMuseumsHotel and holiday accommodationVisitor attractionsPlaces of worship.What about in schools Following the half term break, face coverings are now no longer recommended in school classrooms.However, the Welsh Government said that face coverings should be worn by secondary aged learners, staff and visitors in all schools when moving around indoor communal areas outside of the classroom, such as corridors, where physical distance cannot be maintained.  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eabadbefdccfd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cffecacbeefb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland.

The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line.

In a statement in the chamber, the Minister said the scheme injected at least pound.m into the economy, leading to an improved level of consumer confidence and increased levels of public spending. Today, the Department published a set of management information on the Scheme covering: number of residents issued with a cardnumber and percentage of cards activatedtotal spendnumber of transactions and spend by Local Government District andlocation and spend by postcode.The Minister said: “The High Street Scheme has been a huge success and achieved exactly what it set out to do. It brought shoppers back on to the High Street and has helped and supported our local retail, hospitality and service sectors start their journey of recovery from the devastating impact of the pandemic. “I am really pleased to announce that ,, people were issued with a Spend Local card, of which ,, – or .% – were activated. This is a tremendous achievement. The scheme was designed to provide an economic boost to the local economy and to this end pound.million has been injected into the economy. “This can be clearly seen from the fact that nearly .million customers visited our local shops, restaurants, bars, cafeacutes, cinemas, hairdressers across all parts of Northern Ireland during the letime of the Scheme and over .million new transactions were made using the Spend Local card. “Of course, we know that many of these customers will have spent more than the pound on their Spend Local card. So the figure – in real terms – will be greater.” The Minister told the Assembly that the early analysis showed the benefits of the Scheme were enjoyed in all parts of Northern Ireland. He said: “Over poundmillion was spent in Belfast, over poundmillion in Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon while over poundmillion was spent in each of the following local council areas – Newry, Mourne and Down Derry and Strabane Antrim and Newtownabbey Lisburn and Castlereagh and Ards and North Down. In Mid and East Antrim, the figure was over poundmillion. In Causeway Coast and Glens and in Mid Ulster, more than poundmillion was spent, while the figure for Fermanagh and Omagh was just over pound.million.” MLAs heard how the scale of the task of delivering the High Street Scheme was unprecedented as, in a matter of weeks, his Department implemented a process which manufactured, dispatched and delivered cards to close to .million people – each card unique to each applicant, including bespoke embossed cards for the visually impaired and blind. The Minister told MLAs: “The effort was worth it. I am sure that Members will have heard the same positive messages that I have heard from businesses, but it has also been confirmed by independent analysis.” According to an Ulster Bank Survey, retail sales in Northern Ireland rose in November  for the first time in four months. The banks Chief Economist Richard Ramsey said the High Street Scheme undoubtedly contributed to the pick-up in demand. Research in December  also showed an increase in shoppers on Northern Ireland’s high streets. The figures published by the Northern Ireland Retail Consortiumshowed a boost to the number of people going into shops or businesses in October continuing in November following the introduction of the High Street Scheme. In November, the number of shoppers in Northern Ireland reached their highest point so far compared to the pre-pandemic level. The Minister said: “The people from which I was most pleased to hear were the business owners who needed the scheme to help them cope with the impact of the pandemic. On a personal level, these iniduals – shopkeepers, barbers, newsagents, publicans, cafeacute owners, the list goes on – brought it home to me why this scheme was so important.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dfafdaccbf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_beefcfaaddadfb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
