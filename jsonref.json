Eisenhower both appointed their sons to administrative positions, and President John F. Kennedy made his brother Bobby the attorney general.The latter was widely attacked for his lack of experience, but went on to be both brilliant at the job and beloved.So spare me all the n-word bullsh*t about Ivanka.But, of course, none of this matters to the legion of Trump critics this was just another chance to toss Ivanka onto the social media bonfire once again, and chuckle demonically as she was metaphorically burned alive.Leading the demented charge was Democrat Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the young firebrand socialist who seems to lead the demented charge at everyone and everything.‘It may be shocking to some,’ she tweeted snarkily about the video clip, ‘but being someone’s daughter actually isn’t a career qualification.’                  AOC, as she is known, had been complaining about Ivanka working in the White House despite not being elected when Piers took the opportunity to argue that she herself did not have a long career in politics and had been working in a bar not long before she was put in congressThis glib, sneering tone struck me as particularly inappropriate given that Ms Ocasio-Cortez is herself arguably the least ‘qualified’ member of the House of Representatives in US political history.‘Could be worse,’ I tweeted back, ‘Ivanka could have been a bartender 18 months ago.’This wasn’t, as some promptly claimed, a dig at bartenders.I grew up in a pub in Southern England and have worked behind the bar many times myself.But since Ocasio-Cortez was mocking Ivanka for her lack of experience, I felt it pertinent to point out she herself was still working as a bartender when she won the New York 14th congressional district primary election a year ago.Of course, Ocasio-Cortez reacted to my jibe by doubling down – just as she did last week when she so shamefully compared Trump’s immigration policy on the southern border to the Holocaust.‘Actually,’ she retorted back to me, ‘that would make government better – not worse. Imagine if more people in power spent years of their lives actually working for a living?’         AOC fired back on Sunday morning that it would make government \u0027better\u0027 to have more people there who had worked in bars and restaurantsWow. So now she was saying Ivanka isn’t just unqualified to be a White House Advisor, she’s never worked for a living either.In fact, Ivanka’s worked very hard all her life.Yes, she was born into vast wealth and privilege.But that was not her choice, and I don’t see why she should now be castigated for it.Ivanka enjoyed a successful modelling career before joining her father’s business - working for Versace, Thierry Mugler and Tommy Hiflger, and appearing on myriad magazine covers.She could have carried on doing that, or chosen to do nothing at all. She had no financial need work at all.But instead, she devoted herself to becoming a top businesswoman.After graduating cum laude from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, Ivanka briefly worked as a real estate project manager for Forest City Enterprises before joining the Trump family business in 2005.In 2007, she launched Trump Fine Jewelry and the brand sold throughout the US and Canada, as well as the Middle East.She then launched her own expansive fashion line that sold in major US department stores.She was also, until she accepted the job at the White House, the Executive Vice President of Development and Acquisitions at The Trump Organisation, and served on the board of 100 Women in Hedge Funds, an industry organisation that provides support to women professionals in finance.And when she wasn’t doing all this, she appeared as one of her father’s regular boardroom advisors on hit TV shows The Apprentice and then Celebrity Apprentice.         Ivanka appeared as one of her father’s regular boardroom advisors on hit TV shows The Apprentice and then Celebrity Apprentice (pictured on the show with Piers)It was while filming the first season of the latter that I first met Ivanka and I have spent a lot of time with her over the years.She is one of the most impressive people I know: whip smart, charming, warm, generous and gracious.She’s also a proven skilled negotiator and when she needs to be in business, as steely and hard-nosed as they come.Like her father, she has a very thick skin that enables her to soak up all the relentless and often disgusting abuse and mockery. It’s been a brutal experience that would have destroyed most young women if it happened to them.Yet throughout it all, Ivanka’s calmly and diligently gone about her job, giving service to her country for zero compensation (she’s an unpaid advisor).And unlike her father, she doesn’t engage in unedifying public spats or indeed seemingly engage in any kind unedifying behavior.         Ivanka, pictured with her father and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has proven herself to be skilled negotiator and businesswoman         Ivanka and husband Jared Kushner, far right, traveled to Seoul with Trump and other members of the administrationIn short, Ivanka’s the kind of person who any major company in America would love to have on its top executive team.And I’m glad she’s in the White House, because from my personal experience, there are few people for whom Donald Trump has more respect, or from whom he is prepared to take forthright advice.As for ‘Angel’ Alexandria, I bow to nobody in my admiration for the way she pulled off one of the US political sensations of this Millennium.But when she tries to take the high moral ground with Ivanka, I cry ‘Whoa there, my little firebrand…’For example, Ocasio-Cortez constantly boasts about being a working class ‘girl from the Bronx’ – one of New York’s roughest, toughest neighborhoods.Yet what this blue-collar champion of the people isn’t so keen to boast about is that when she was just five, her architect father Sergio moved the family from the Bronx to a nice home in Yorktown Heights, in Westchester County – one of New York’s wealthiest suburbs.He did this so his children could go to better schools than they would in the Bronx.In other words, like Donald Trump only on a far smaller scale, he used his comparative wealth to give his kids an advantage in life.Ocasio-Cortez also portrays herself a feminist icon, making endless pronouncements about the need to respect women.‘The reason women are critiqued for being too loud, or too meek, too big or too small, too smart to be attractive or too attractive to be smart,’ she declared recently, ‘is to belittle women out of standing up publicly. The goal is to ‘critique’ into submission.’Fine words.But how do they now sit with Ocasio-Cortez launching a vicious and deliberately belittling ‘critique’ on Ivanka Trump, mocking her for never having properly worked, and for only getting a job because of her Daddy?       Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez entered a war of words on Twitter on Sunday over Ivanka Trump working in the White House despite not being elected and the Democratic congresswoman\u0027s recent bartending jobIt’s hard to imagine a more degrading insult for a woman who has in fact worked hard all her life, both during her education and during her adult career. Or a more hypocritical one, coming from someone with miniscule political experience whose own father gave HER a head start too.There’s also the small matter of Ocasio-Cortez’s political opinions, with many experts saying her policies on issues like healthcare, tuition fees and climate change would swiftly bankrupt America.Ivanka, as she invariably does, maintained a dignified silence over Ocasio-Cortez’s nasty attacks.But she did tweet this: ‘The United States is the only country in the G20 with an entirely female negotiating team representing President Trump and advancing his policies.’That is an extraordinary fact, and one you might assume a radical feminist like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would applaud?But no, she was so wrapped up in her poisonous mockery of Ivanka’s fitness to serve her country that she never stopped to consider the incredibly powerful statement the US negotiating team is making.The irony of all this is that the 2024 US election could possibly be fought between Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ivanka Trump.And if it is, I can confidently predict that not only would Ivanka win, she’d make a damn sight better president than a hypocritical former bartender with a constantly bitching jealousy chip on both shoulders."},{"url":null,"title":"Alps mountain bikers end giant pile racing slope","story":"Share this article One cyclist stands at the bottom of the slope with their hands clasped to their head watching in horror as others keep tumbling like dominoes.No injuries were reported as a result of the large scale bike crash.

I\u0027m hyper vigilant and hyper sensitive, living in fear that Sebastian is still out there and could at any time come back to hurt myself or my children.\u0027I\u0027m scared to open the door. When I hear noises I\u0027m on edge, jumping, knowing Sebastian could be around the corner or outside the house. I have severe panic attacks, night sweats and flashbacks, unable to sleep thinking he might get into the house so I repeatedly plan which child to help first if he breaks in.\u0027Sebastian stole my little boys trust, his hopes and his beliefs causing immense upset and heartache for us. I\u0027m afraid, frightened for the children\u0027s and my own safety.\u0027I have permanent spinal cord damage which means I have tremors. I get asked by my toddler what is that? when he is referring to the large scar across my neck.

Worst of all, I\u0027m unable to button up my little boys coats and shirts.\u0027I\u0027m always on edge, I\u0027m wary of new relationships and I fear being in crowded and busy public places. I\u0027m unable to write properly, hold a pen, do simple things like colour with my boys. I feel humiliated, frustrated and ashamed with such lack of mobility, excruciating pain, numbness and the tremors.\u0027Today, the permanent injuries and scar are a constant remind of what Sebastian has done to me. They are also a reminder of how strong I have had to become especially for my children. I have never and won\u0027t ever give up for my two little boys.\u0027The assault took place on July 27, 2017 after the couple had been in a relationship for three years. Miss Blake already had a nine year old son from a previous relationship and she and Swamy had a child together.Prosecuting, Maria Masselis said: \u0027Everything was fine in to begin with but issues began to rise as he had issues with gambling and alcohol and she was concerned about his place of responsibility towards her son when he was supposed to be babysitting.\u0027She described how his behaviour towards her had become difficult when he was drunk. There were allegations of violence which predate the incident - she reported some of these matters to the police but they were not pursued. He got increasingly drunk and gambled whilst on a work night out.\u0027There was a family holiday to Greece and she says how the defendant was drunk on the flight to the destination and he caused difficulties. From August 2016 the relationship declined.\u0027\u0027On July 27, 2017, the defendant had been out allegedly in connection with work, and had consumed a great quantity of alcohol and caused arguments between them. He went to Manchester and returned later than expected.\u0027The couple entered into an argument where he proceeded to push her to the back, forcing her to the floor. As she fell she was on her front and started to turn over when he stamped down on her back. She described feeling as if she was a squashed beetle.         Ms Blake, pictured here while recovering from the attack, told police she felt like Swamy had \u0027squashed\u0027 her like a beetle\u0027The pain she felt was immediate and she proceeded to roll over onto her back, but the defendant used the other foot to stamp down on her chest. He said he had enough of her and she needed to shut up.\u0027He took two mobile phones from her so she was unable to contact the police as she had in the past. He repeated what would happen to her, and she said he threatened her with social services and she would lose control of her children in the past.\u0027The defendant went upstairs to the third floor and locked himself away and refused her access to the phones. She made her way out of the house, flagged down two neighbours and she begged them for help.\u0027Whilst helping her, the defendant was seen to come out of the address and he was seen shouting. He got into a car and drive away leaving her to the fate of the neighbours.\u0027She was diagnosed with a collapsed lung, a fractured rib and a fractured bone in her face. She had a series of treatments. She was in hospital for four days, during which a spine injury was detected with a Ct Scan. Her lung had been punctured by the fractured rib, which shows the degree of force used. She was given oral painkillers.\u0027Subsequent to her release, she went back to hospital to report new symptoms including pains to her neck, arms and legs. She was fitted with a neck brace and diagnosed with a disc bulge in her spine. She received spinal surgery. She suffered both physically and psychologically and this has had a serious professional physical effect on her and continues to do.Swamy was arrested but initially claimed he was acting in self defence. His defence lawyer Lee Karu said: \u0027He is educated and was doing quite well but unfortunately he was the victim of a massive nationwide scam where he lost £100,000. His family are reasonably well off and we\u0027re able to assist on their part but he did have an alcohol and gambling addiction.\u0027Sadly the effect of that was somebody else\u0027s life has been affected in the way it has.\u0027Sentencing Judge Steven Everett told Swamy: \u0027A father in any sense of the word should be expected to show love, kindness, affection, protection and safety towards his partner and their children. But o that particular night you showed none of that. What you did was get yourself abhorrently drunk.\u0027You were truly, truly horrible and showed horrendous behaviour towards your partner. You didn\u0027t give any thought to the effect on her on that night or afterwards. You gave no thought to the effect on your two children at all. It was drunk, selfish and violent behaviour.\u0027There was a row, she was a victim throughout that night. The row was made out of your behaviour. Having then become involved in that row you finished it off in a truly horribly violent way, causing serious and and catastrophic injuries to your victim.         Judge Steven Everett condemned Swamy\u0027s \u0027horrendous behaviour\u0027, which had a \u0027hugely serious and catastrophic effect\u0027 on Ms Blake\u0027s life\u0027This had a hugely serious and catastrophic effect on her life. You used considerable power and there was a considerable effect. You kicked her to the floor. You stamped on her back. This was a hugely powerful stamp.\u0027When she turned over, as there was nothing else she could do, you stamped on the front of her chest. As if that wasn\u0027t bad enough you took her phones off her to prevent her from calling the police. For her, life had never been the same again. Abigail Blake came to court to read her victim personal statement and everything she read was relevant to the case.\u0027Everybody heard her give her statement in the most courageous way - it was very damning of the history of the effect that particular night had on the rest of her life. The reality of this particular case is that, for this person and for her children, life will never be the same again forever, everything has changed for her. She has been disastrously affected by that night. Time will tell how much better she will be.\u0027She now will never be able to pick up her child, and something I found particularly distressing was the fact she will never be able to button up her children\u0027s clothing. That\u0027s the sort of thing one expects to see a parent do. It appears to be a normal thing to do a children\u0027s buttons up, it is a thing we take for granted, and she cannot take that for granted anymore.\u0027You caused this. You caused this affect on those two little boys. That\u0027s come as a result of your selfish, violent, alcohol-fuelled behaviour.

The series ran for 75 issues, and has often been described as unfilmable, with previous attempts to adapt it foundering. The most recent was in 2016, when actor and fan Joseph Gordon-Levitt acquired the rights and was due to direct a film adaptation in which he also played Morpheus – but left the project due to “creative differences” with studio New Line.Now 11 episodes have been ordered by Netflix, which described the series as “a rich blend of modern myth and dark fantasy in which contemporary fiction, historical drama and legend are seamlessly interwoven”.Gaiman will write the first episode with showrunner Allan Heinberg and David S Goyer. The author, who is fresh from adapting the novel he wrote with Terry Pratchett, Good Omens, said the first series would only cover Preludes and Nocturnes – the first eight comics in the Sandman series.“I’m hoping we can make something on television that feels as personal and true as the best of the Sandman comics did. Just set 30 years later than Sandman the comic,” Gaiman wrote on Twitter. He said he would be less involved than he had been with Good Omens, where he was showrunner for the Amazon Prime series, but “much more” involved than he has been with the Starz adaptation of his novel American Gods, for which he was an executive producer.“We’re thrilled to partner with the brilliant team that is Neil Gaiman, David S Goyer and Allan Heinberg to finally bring Neil’s iconic comic book series, The Sandman, to life on screen,” said Netflix’s Channing Dungey. “From its rich characters and storylines to its intricately built-out worlds, we’re excited to create an epic original series that es deep into this multi-layered universe beloved by fans.”Moving between the dawn of time to the eve of the new millennium in London and the Renaissance, the Sandman follows Morpheus as he gets to grips with the changes that have taken place in the world as he lay captive. It also tells the stories of his six siblings, the Endless, who include Death, Destiny and Desire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ba450b007512232ce9cc09532ec96c82b62749c/0_173_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97ce50c4eac3b2bcc0258654b2625c7a","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost.

As gripping as the plot is, NY itself is very much the star of the show, a place imprisoned in thuggish corruption, where the police conspire with, rather than against, crime, a maze of alleyways crawling with the street-urchins who survive on the city’s garbage, darting beneath the wheels of carriages, acting as newspaper-sellers, and loitering at the edge of squalid saloons. It is brought wonderfully to life in his writing.Meanwhile, nina1414 takes us to the Dodecanese with Lawrence Durrell and his Reflections On A Marine Venus: A Companion To The Landscape of Rhodes:The best bits were about Durrell and his companions and life on the island of Rhodes when he was sent there in May 1945. They were delightful. My favourite phrase was “ferociously unshaven gentlemen”. I don’t know why - but I was taken by that.At the end, there is a calendar of flowers and saints. And a footnote acknowledges the help of Dr Theodore Stephanides - the Theodore of Corfu, I assume. For some silly reason, it made me happy to see his name. He was such a nice character in the Gerald Durrell books and, from what I can gather, well respected by his fellow Greeks as an academic.The Devil’s Diary by Patrick McGinley has delighted BaddHamster:Set in Donegal in the 1980s it tells of strange goings on in a seaside town. A priest disapproves of modernity and the introduction of a cash economy. His mysterious brother returns from overseas and may or may not be a little mad. And there’s something shady about their childhood days. Beautifully written, you can practically smell the turf fires and the seaspray and a creepy plot that threatens horror with every turn of the page. I’d never read McGinley before, but I’m delighted to make his acquaintance now and roam the spooky hills after dark where all manner of shenanigans may be transpiring, just out of sight.ID583532 “wasn’t looking forward” to reading Welcome to Lagos by Chibundu Onuzo, “but I did and how glad I am that I did”:It was a terrific read! I loved the detail and vibrancy of the description of life in the city of Lagos, the delta and rural regions. The characterisation was excellent and the dynamics of the relationships engaging and convincing. There was no happy ending as such (and how could there be?), but the ending was largely positive and the message hopeful.This year’s Man Booker Prize International winner, Celestial Bodies by Jokha Alharthi, has intrigued Rex Bowan:It started by reminding me of The Waves but by the end, with the village, the confusing shifts in perspective, the barrage of history and madness revealed at the end of the book, it brought Faulkner to mind even more. I was pleased to read something experimental but I didn’t feel like my understanding or knowledge of Oman grew as a result of reading it.Finally, Vicc is “slowly reading” The Narrow Road to the Interior by Matsuo Bashō translated by Sam Hamill:Such a joy. A few words painting wonderful pictures of Japan in the 17th century. Calming and serene with beautiful haiku. Even the difficulties and sadness are something Bashō accepts:Through nine hellish days of heat and rain, all my old maladies tormenting me again, feverish and weak, I could not write. Altair meets Vega tomorrow - Tanabata - already the night is changedWhat an antidote to the world of today.That does indeed sound like a tonic.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

A PMI figure below 50 shows the sector contracted.The purchasing managers\u0027 indices, or PMIs, track services sector companies, manufacturers and building firms around the world.They measure activity, output, business confidence and hiring levels, to produce a health check on how these sectors are performing.PMIs are compiled each month from interviews with \u0027purchasing managers\u0027 at thousands of companies. They produce a single headline figure – anything above 50 indicates a sector is growing, while a figure below 50 shows a contraction.Economists watch these surveys closely as they look ahead to coming months, while the official data, such as gross domestic product and retail sales, tends to be more backward-looking.\u0026nbspLast month a combination of the construction, services and manufacturing sector surveys indicated that the economy was at its weakest in May since 2012. Analysts expect the downturn to continue after the sharpest drop in factory output in June for more than six years, following figures for May showing a drop in mortgage lending and the lowest level of growth in consumer borrowing in more than five years.The fall in housebuilding was the largest reported for three years, which construction companies linked to a weaker outlook for residential sales.Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the possibility that a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour party might win an autumn election was dampening demand for large-scale civil engineering projects.“All three main sub-sectors – housebuilding, commercial and civil engineering – reported sharp falls in activity. The threat of a no-deal Brexit reportedly has dampened demand for commercial projects, while the risk of a Corbyn government following a general election has hindered activity in the civil engineering sector,” he said.“Construction firms, however, expect the current downturn to be brief employment held steady in June, while expectations for levels of future activity improved slightly and were in line with those in the last six months.”Tim Moore, an associate director at IHS Markit, said the deepening political and economic uncertainty were the main reasons cited by construction companies for the fastest drop in total construction output since April 2009."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c916117ae28bd8fc2db10be8aaf7019b6bff5b31/0_177_5058_3035/master/5058.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=978fdfe28744313bcd92885df9470faf","title":"why facebook libra currency gets the thumbs down","story":"Only a fool would trust Facebook with their financial wellbeing. But maybe that’s the point of the Libra currencyFacebook and some of its corporate allies have decided that what the world really needs is another cryptocurrency, and that launching one is the best way to use the vast talents at their disposal. The fact that Facebook thinks so reveals much about what is wrong with 21st-century American capitalism.In some ways, it’s a curious time to be launching an alternative currency. In the past, the main complaint about traditional currencies was their instability, with rapid and uncertain inflation making them a poor store of value. But the dollar, the euro, the yen, and the renminbi have all been remarkably stable. If anything, the worry today is about deflation, not inflation.The world has also made progress on financial transparency, making it more difficult for the banking system to be used to launder money and for other nefarious activities. And technology has enabled us to complete transactions efficiently, moving money from customers’ accounts into those of retailers in nanoseconds, with remarkably good fraud protection. The last thing we need is a new vehicle for nurturing illicit activities and laundering the proceeds, which another cryptocurrency will almost certainly turn out to be.The real problem with our existing currencies and financial arrangements, which serve as a means of payment as well as a store of value, is the lack of competition among, and regulation of, the companies that control transactions. As a result, consumers – especially in the US – pay a multiple of what payments should cost, lining the pockets of Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and banks with tens of billions of dollars of “rents” – excessive profits – every year. The Durbin Amendment to the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation curbs the excessive fees charged for debit cards only to a very limited extent, and it did nothing about the much bigger problem of excessive fees associated with credit cards.Facebook says Libra is a \u0027global currency and financial infrastructure\u0027 - a digital asset built by Facebook and powered by a new Facebook-created version of blockchain, the encrypted technology used by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The name Libra comes from the basic Roman measurement of weight. The abbreviation lb for pound is derived from Libra, and the £ symbol originally comes from an ornate L in Libra.Facebook claims it wants to reach the 1.7 billion people around the world who do not have access to a bank account.Facebook is likely to run into regulatory hurdles and antitrust concerns. The currency will be serviced by a collective of companies called the \u0027Libra Association\u0027. It functions as what is known as a \u0027stablecoin\u0027, pegged to existing assets like the dollar or euro, in the aim of making it less subject to the volatility that many cryptocurrencies experience.The Libra Association is described by Facebook as an independent, not-for-profit organisation based in Switzerland. Within the Libra Association will be a governing body called the Libra Association Council, comprised of a representative of each member of the association, which will vote on policy and operating decisions.Facebook claims that although it created the Libra Association and the Libra Blockchain, once the currency is launched in 2020 the company will withdraw from a leadership role and all members of the association will have equal votes in governance of Libra. The companies who contributed a minimum of $10m(£8m) to be listed as founding members of the Libra Association include tech companies such as PayPal, Ebay, Spotify, Uber and Lyft, as well as financial and venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, Visa and Mastercard.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhen the cryptocurrency launches, users can download Calibra, a digital wallet, that will allow them to send it to anyone with a smartphone. It will be available in Messenger, WhatsApp, and as a standalone app.It is not clear which countries the coin will launch in first, though Facebook said \u0027almost anybody\u0027 in the world with a smartphone will be able to download the app.Other countries, such as Australia, have done a much better job, including by forbidding credit card companies from using contractual provisions to restrain competition, whereas the US supreme court, in another of its 5-4 decisions, seemed to turn a blind eye to such provisions’ anti-competitive effects. But even if the US decides to have a non-competitive second-rate financial system, Europe and the rest of the world should say no: it is not anti-American to be pro-competition, as Trump seems to have recently suggested in his criticism of the European commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager.One might well ask: what is Facebook’s business model, and why do so many seem so interested in its new venture? It could be that they want a cut of the rents accruing to the platforms through which transactions are processed. The fact that they believe that more competition won’t drive down profits to near zero attests to the corporate sector’s confidence in its ability to wield market power – and in its political power to ensure that government won’t intervene to curb these excesses.With the US supreme court’s renewed commitment to undermining American democracy, Facebook and its friends might think they have little to fear. But regulators, entrusted not just with maintaining stability, but also with ensuring competition in the financial sector, should step in. And elsewhere in the world, there is less enthusiasm for America’s tech dominance with its anti-competitive practices.There are two obvious answers to the question of the business model: one is that people who engage in nefarious activities are willing to pay a pretty penny to have their nefarious activities – corruption, tax avoidance, drug dealing, or terrorism – go undetected. But, having made so much progress in impeding the use of the financial system to facilitate crime, why would anyone – let alone the government or financial regulators – condone such a tool simply because it bears the label “tech”?If this is Libra’s business model, governments should shut it down immediately. At the very least, Libra should be subject to the same transparency regulations that apply to the rest of the financial sector. But then it wouldn’t be a cryptocurrency.Alternatively, the data Libra transactions provide could be mined, like all the other data that’s come into Facebook’s possession – reinforcing its market power and profits, and further undermining our security and privacy. Facebook (or Libra) might promise not to do that, but who would believe it?Then there is the broader question of trust. Every currency is based on confidence that the hard-earned money “deposited” into it will be redeemable on demand. The private banking sector has long shown that it is untrustworthy in this respect, which is why new prudential regulations have been necessary.But, in just a few short years, Facebook has earned a level of distrust that took the banking sector much longer to achieve. Time and again, Facebook’s leaders, faced with a choice between money and honouring their promises, have grabbed the money. And nothing could be more about money than creating a new currency. Only a fool would trust Facebook with his or her financial wellbeing. But maybe that’s the point: with so much personal data on some 2.4bn monthly active users, who knows better than Facebook just how many suckers are born every minute?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eb5368261ec9ec8dfdf9ddd458bfaf7e87a74ea/0_413_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2a3e90fb1ea72b34bacf78e2161bd38","title":"theres no way to stop this oakland braces for the arrival of tech firm square","story":"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has signed a deal to move his payments company to Oakland – which activists say will only exacerbate an already brutal housing crisisPhotographs by Jason HenryThe knocks on Maria Espinoza’s front door became a nightly occurrence.If the 60-year-old Oakland woman wasn’t home, her frightened partner would turn off the lights and TV and remain silent. On evenings Espinoza did answer the door, her new landlord would be outside with the same question: When are you moving out?Espinoza, who used to run a restaurant in Oakland, has lived in the building in the Eastlake neighborhood for decades. But last year, the property got a new owner, Thao Le, who has tried to push out the building’s tenants ever since, Espinoza said.One of the official eviction notices accused the family of “theft of electricity”, Espinoza thinks because they had put up a light to illuminate a dark hallway.“She’s trying to find something to kick us out,” said Espinoza. “It is really stressful.”Huechi Wong, a lawyer for Le, disputed Espinoza’s account, denied that Le had knocked on Espinoza’s door on nightly basis, and argued Espinoza had created a fire hazard by connecting speaker wires to a common area in the building. Sarah McCracken, Espinoza’s attorney, said that allegation was false.Espinoza and her partner fear the landlord wants to see them leave in order to charge the next tenant a higher rent. That fear is increasingly common among lower-paying residents in this northern California city as a massive real estate deal in the city’s downtown neighborhood may accelerate the gentrification of Oakland to rates unseen.Housing advocates and tenant rights groups warn that the threat that has loomed large for years is now close to becoming an irreversible reality: The tech industry is coming for The Town.In December 2018, Square, the payments processor corporation run by Jack Dorsey, the Twitter CEO, signed a lease for a 356,000-square-foot building in downtown.Square’s lease of the 1920s-era property known as Uptown Station, which was once proposed as a headquarters for Uber, marked one of the biggest real estate deals in Oakland’s history. Square plans to start moving in employees later this year, and the building has capacity for up to 2,000 workers.But housing advocates fear Square’s arrival will also invite other startups and tech companies to invade the East Bay city, and advocates say the real estate industry’s anticipation of the project is already impacting Oakland’s housing market.“Oakland is the new ground zero in terms of the housing affordability crisis,” said Camilo Sol Zamora, an organizer with Causa Justa, a local tenants’ rights group. “It’s a shrinking, shrinking working class.”.Big tech has transformed the communities and the culture of Northern California’s Bay Area in the past decade, and Oakland has been feeling the impact of that transformation for years. Modern condos have appeared left and right, many working-class residents have left for suburbs further inland, housing prices have spiked.Inequality in Oakland has escalated as neighboring San Francisco lured tech companies with major tax breaks and became too expensive a place to live – even for tech workers. Oakland neighborhoods, many of them just a short drive or train ride away, became an affordable alternative for San Francisco residents fleeing the city’s price tag. Oakland experienced some of the most rapid rent increases in the US. The area’s monthly median rent for a one-bedroom has risen to more than $2,300, requiring workers to earn $50 an hour to stay afloat. Last year, US federal housing officials classified a six-figure salary as low-income in the region. When Oakland recently opened the doors to a new affordable housing development, 4,000 people competed for just 28 spots. More than 2,700 people in the city are estimated to be homeless.In the traditionally black neighborhood of West Oakland, historic Victorian houses would sell for $25,000 20years ago. Now, some go on the market for more than $1m, noted James Vann, a longtime tenant advocate.“There’s no way to stop this,” he said.“I’m saddened that we’re allowing the landscape of Oakland to change,” added EmilyRose Johns, an Oakland-based housing rights attorney. “We saw what happened in San Francisco, and it can and will happen here.”Exacerbating advocates’ fears is the history of Square CEO Jack Dorsey when it comes to the Bay Area’s housing crisis. Dorsey has made his position on homelessness and social services known: his companies should not have to pay.Last year, Dorsey publicly opposed Proposition C, a tax on high-earning businesses that would redirect millions of dollars to help people living on the streets of San Francisco, including those languishing in the footprint of Twitter’s HQ. Square donated $25,000 to the campaign opposing the homeless funding, and Dorsey personally contributed $75,000.Twitter has saved millions benefiting from city tax breaks, but Dorsey felt Prop C would unfairly impact Square and other financial tech companies. Dorsey supported “addressing homelessness long-term in a scalable way, with accountability” he said, not through Prop C.A Square spokesperson declined to comment on its advocacy against Prop C.Shanti Singh, a tenant organizer and former tech worker, said that not funding “harmful policies” was the bare minimum a company could do to be a decent neighbor, and that Square had already failed.Zamora, the Causa Justa organizer, said it was troubling that the company set to transform Oakland had a documented record of opposing a tax that would help those most in need: “I’m really worried. They need to do better … Square is going to make Oakland great for a few people, but not for everybody.”Residents who are already struggling to survive fear the incoming tech workers and other newcomers are going to make their already dire situation worse. In the neighborhoods surrounding Square’s new home, hundreds of people are living in street encampments and cars – many of them locals who lost homes through evictions and unaffordable rent increases.“It’s a tug-of-war between those who live out here and those who don’t,” said Nicole Burns, a 35-year-old homeless woman, who lives out of an RV at an encampment site by a park a few miles from the new Square building. “There’s a line drawn. We’re on one side and they’re on the other.”Burns, who grew up in Oakland not far from the park where she is currently sleeping, became homeless after losing a nonprofit job and going through a orce. Living out of a vehicle with her dog and fiancee is the only option that works for her right now – and one of the hardest parts is dealing with officials trying to move her along. Often, she said, citizen complaints seem to drive this pressure.“The situation is hard enough with the daily struggles of trying to live this way,” she said. “Anyone who is in a position to uplift the situation or provide some kind of relief is trying to push us out, or put us under this umbrella of being dirty and bad.”Last December, when the city moved to clear the homeless from the area, Burns said a cleanup crew ended up tossing many of her belongings, including Christmas presents she had bought for family: “They look at it as junk and crap. But it’s everything we have.”Oakland has already been the site of internationally viral stories about people unjustly calling authorities on longtime residents, most famously the woman known as “BBQ Becky” who complained to police about a group of black Oaklanders barbecuing in a park. In 2015, a white man called police on a drum circle.“People don’t even bother to try to fit into the present culture,” said Vann, noting that new developments in West Oakland are often gated and uninviting.“People call all the time to report everything just to get it out of their view, to get it out of their way,” said Johns, the local attorney, who is currently representing Burns in a lawsuit against the city trying to stop authorities from forcing the homeless out of the park.“They’re evicting us from point A to point B,” said Burns. “How is this helping anybody?”There are ways Square could try and partially mitigate the company’s role in widening inequality in Oakland, and community activists say it’s important to establish a precedent with Square given that it’s likely that other companies will follow.Since its Oakland deal, Square has established a formal contract with the TechEquity Collaborative, a group that formed in the wake of Uber’s initial plans to take over the Sears building four years ago. TechEquity leaders said they were working with Square on workforce development efforts to encourage local hiring and finding ways to get the company to support small businesses and arts and culture.“Square has been showing a willingness to have conversations,” said Catherine Bracy, TechEquity co-founder, adding that her organization would have an announcement in the coming weeks about specific commitments and plans . “I’m cautiously optimistic.”But providing substantial financial support to the community should only be a starting point, activists say. “A community benefits agreement is step zero,” said Singh, the tenant organizer.Some critics said they want to see Square actively lobby for housing policies that help protect the people most likely to be displaced from their homes – laws that expand rent control and close loopholes landlords exploit to remove longtime tenants.Square declined to offer details about specific benefits it plans to provide to Oakland. A spokesperson said a significant number of its employees already live in the East Bay, but did not provide numbers.“For the last several months we’ve been in conversation with a wide range of local community groups to identify ways that we can collaborate and be good neighbors. Incorporating all the feedback we’ve received, we’re in the process of developing plans to hire locally and provide support to Oakland-based entrepreneurs and small businesses,” the spokesperson said in an email.Without stronger protections, people such as Maria Espinoza will pay the price. If she loses the battle with her landlord, Espinoza said, she would likely have to move into one of her children’s homes. When she got her first notice from the owner, she used a whole tank of gas driving around Oakland looking at available apartments. None were affordable.Espinoza said the threats from the new landlord already scared one family in her building into moving out. But Espinoza is determined to keep fighting.“We actually do have rights,” she said. “We shouldn’t just shut up and be fearful.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/725f356875beecb8483de9089b8b0af30b24b7d2/0_177_3214_1928/master/3214.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42acef8b3cc1d48dc5a402e9a3e7fb08","title":"civil servants discuss corbyn journalists labour","story":"Gossiping to journalists is unacceptable, but the service does need to consider the capability of potential future prime ministersJeremy Corbyn is owed an apology, and when he meets Mark Sedwill, the head of the civil service, he will presumably get one. Senior civil servants are not supposed to gossip to journalists, which means that whoever supplied Saturday’s Times with comments about longstanding rumours of the Labour leader’s supposed physical and mental unfitness to become prime minister simply doesn’t have a leg to stand on. Downing Street’s unexpectedly strong intervention in Corbyn’s defence, with No 10 arguing that it would “be inappropriate and unacceptable for comments of this sort to have been made or briefed to the press”, underlines how seriously the concept of political neutrality or civil service willingness to serve without judgment is taken.But let’s clear about what Sedwill should, and should not, be clamping down on here. Rumours have been flying for months not only about Corbyn’s physical health, which the leader’s office categorically denies, but more broadly about his intellectual capacity his ability to master an endless series of complex briefs and take timely decisions on difficult issues, while simultaneously managing a sometimes fractious party and dealing with whatever unexpected crisis blows up. Some of that speculation has centred unfairly on his age, but some has more to do with the way he has led his party to date.Corbyn is absolutely entitled to expect civil servants picking up on this gossip – and unless they were living under a rock, nobody working at Westminster could have missed it – not to make it public, especially where it is ill-founded. But expecting civil servants, thinking ahead to the possibility of dealing with a new boss, not to discuss between themselves something that journalists and MPs have been privately discussing all summer? That would be not only impossible to enforce, but as a broader principle potentially dangerous.Take Corbyn out of the equation for a moment, and there is a wider question here about how government machines should in general respond to the prospect of being run by a democratically elected person about whom they nonetheless have some legitimate concerns. For years, British civil servants have watched the current White House struggle with the ethical and constitutional dilemmas thrown up by working for a president who was the choice of the people but is arguably wholly lacking in the qualities needed for the job.By autumn, Whitehall could find itself serving a new Conservative administration whose stated objective is a no-deal Brexit regardless of the consequences – or even, following a referendum, conceivably for a government with a democratic mandate to pursue one. If so, there will be sleepless nights ahead for some of those whose job is to follow political orders regardless of any personal misgivings. Civil servants do have some powers to resist decisions they believe to be dangerous for the country – in extremis, they can ask ministers to formally instruct them to follow any directive breaching legal regularity, propriety, value for money or feasibility – but those safeguards are limited. It is not inconceivable that Brexit will test them to breaking point. Would we expect civil servants not to discuss this behind closed doors, too?None of this justifies attempting to sway the results of a pending general election, or for that matter an internal party election. (If you think Westminster isn’t also alive with chatter about the impact of Boris Johnson’s orce and new relationship on his judgment, some of it doubtless as ill-founded or coloured by ideological hostility as anything said about Corbyn, then think again). But scurrilous gossip doth not by itself a coup in the planning make, and while Sedwill should apologise unreservedly for private conversations becoming public, it would set a dangerous future precedent to apologise for such impure thoughts being voiced in the first place. Those who seek ultimate power can expect to face impertinent, even unreasonable questions, and they can also expect conclusions to be drawn from the way they respond. The stakes are simply too high now for it to be otherwise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5fab6ec5b648f0aa48ac0c99ee02fbe7ec2618c/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=362f0b062bb8cddc84b24f47bee9c827","title":"hong kong democracy china","story":"By accident or design, the eruption of political violence in Hong Kong has opened the way for direct rule from Beijing. It is unlikely radical new measures to bring Britain’s former colony to heel will be imposed overnight. But furious official statements in response to Monday’s unprecedented clashes suggest the “one country, two systems” principle that has kept capitalist Hong Kong functioning alongside, and within, communist China for the past 22 years could be on its last legs.This long-simmering crisis of mutual confidence, now finding expression through physical confrontation, is exactly what the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984, which laid legal grounds for the 1997 handover, was intended to avoid. It states unambiguously that “the current social and economic systems in Hong Kong will remain unchanged, and so will the lifestyle. Rights and freedoms, including those of the person, of speech, of the press, of assembly … and of religious belief will be ensured by law.”These fundamental rights are routinely ignored in mainland China under the authoritarian leadership of Xi Jinping. Hong Kong residents have watched with alarm as basic freedoms and the “high degree of autonomy”, guaranteed to them in the joint declaration, have been relentlessly chipped away. The row over a proposed law facilitating extradition of criminal suspects to the mainland, where the judiciary is politically directed, is but one symptom of a more deep-seated unease.If China’s leaders had kept the solemn promises made to Margaret Thatcher, Hong Kong’s slow, chronic collapse of trust might not have occurred. But Beijing, having achieved its aim of regaining control, has grown increasingly complacent, even arrogant. It declared two years ago that the joint declaration, a UN-registered treaty intended to remain in force for 50 years, was a non-binding “historical document” lacking “any practical significance”. Its agreed guarantees were null and void.Given it recognises no legal or other constraints on its behaviour, Xi’s regime will now feel free to deal with the Hong Kong unrest as it sees fit. The signs are ominous. Whether or not the violence was deliberately orchestrated by Beijing, as Martin Lee, the respected pro-democracy activist and former legislator, has suggested, China seems determined to exploit the opportunity it has created to tighten its grip and accelerate the process of forcible political assimilation.The Global Times, a Communist party mouthpiece, played up the protesters’ “reckless and savage violence” and urged zero tolerance. Professing concern for the city’s future as a “reliable” international hub, it said the threat to social order must be eliminated. “Without this policy, it would be similar to opening a Pandora’s Box.”These are statements of intent. Xi and the cadres fully understand the benefits to China, especially at this juncture in its ambitious economic development, of having one of the world’s foremost financial and business centres under their wing. They also surely realise a Tiananmen-style military crackdown would have severely negative international repercussions. But what to do if turbulence in Hong Kong persists, threatening a wider contagion?Imposing de facto direct rule from Beijing while maintaining the rhetoric of “one country, two systems” and the pretence of self-governance looks like an increasingly attractive solution for Xi. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s unpopular chief executive, will be kept in place, if only because allowing her ousting would reflect badly on China’s president. Autonomous appearances will be kept up. But the prospective reality, more so than is already the case, is of a mere puppet administration whose direction and policies are set in Beijing.Xi values the wealth and opportunities Hong Kong provides. But he cannot tolerate dissent on this scale, given existing discontent across mainland China sparked by the economic slowdown, governance failures and expanding state authoritarianism. His nightmare is that insurrectionary democratic ideas could spread and be exploited by outside actors. For him, Hong Kong is a great prize turned potential Trojan horse.The US and Britain are most often singled out for attack, even though the British government has been restrained in its comments – in fact, far too much so. “The anti-extradition drive has all the hallmarks of a US-patented ‘colour revolution’,” a pro-regime commentator, Thomas Hon Wing Polin, wrote last month. “Classic characteristics: long-term cultivation of local opposition leaders, always under the ‘pro-democracy’ banner funding, direct and indirect support via media propaganda and advisers on destabilisation and even uprisings and recognition of the ‘democrats’, if regime change is necessary.”This is mostly paranoid fantasy. But it is correct in one key respect. The Hong Kong “two systems” crisis reflects a broader, global clash not of civilisations but of ideologies, crudely defined – a contest between liberal, democratic laws-based governance and authoritarian, nationalist-populist “strongman” rule. It is the defining struggle of our age. Which is why Hong Kong’s protesters deserve whole-hearted support – and Xi must not be allowed to crush them.• Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator and former  foreign editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5c239d7a010a7fb59312c965d6a1a51e2b8cefc/279_145_1437_862/master/1437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12341e88730add161da0a1817ed32f62","title":"crickets urban drive batting beyond boundaries","story":"An Islington youth project has transported cricket from the village green into the heart of inner-city communities.  Chas Newkey-Burden meets the children getting involvedOn a five-a-side football pitch, a short stroll from the Arsenal stadium, local kids are falling in love with sport. But it’s cricket, not football, that has them buzzing.For the past four years, thanks to the Islington Chance to Shine Street Youth project, Mikey Thompson has run weekly sessions at this north London leisure centre for the Eritrean Youth Club.Holding classes all year round, whatever the weather – including snow – the Islington setup is a far cry from the sleepy sun-kissed village greens often associated with the game.Thompson, 55, is known as the godfather of inner-city cricket. He says his mission is simple: “to put a bit of joy back on to kids’ faces”.It’s working. The children are enraptured by his down-to-earth approach, which relies on simple drills to teach them the basic disciplines of cricket. As the sun shines, the kids support one another, screams of joy keep going up, and the smiles are everywhere.Eight-year-old Sesen says her favourite part of cricket is the batting. “It feels so nice when I hit the ball because the bat really vibrates in my hands!”But there is another reason why she enjoys picking up the bat. “It makes my hands more steady,” says Sesen. “This is important, because when I grow up I want to be an artist and then my hands will have to be still, so my art doesn’t go all wiggly.”Winta, also eight, says that the sessions have helped her emotionally. “It helps me feel more confident in life,” she says. “If I’m a bit upset in the middle of the week, I just think about cricket and it immediately makes me feel better.”The project has the “open to all” ethos of its backer, Chance to Shine, a charity that aims to give all children the opportunity to play, learn and develop through the game of cricket. Chance to Shine’s main partner, NatWest, also has a long history of supporting grassroots cricket, facilitating schemes to assist communities and to show iniduals that anyone can play, no matter their level of experience.Hiyab, 12, personifies this. He says that when he first came to the sessions, he knew nothing about cricket and wasn’t even sure whether he would be able to play it. “But now I’ve got really confident because I did better than I expected,” he says, with a big grin.Hanan, 10, is also “surprised” by how well he did when he started going along. Before he knew it he was being picked for his school cricket team he now dreams of playing in the Olympics one day.Nine-year-old Selina thinks more children should get involved in cricket, whatever their circumstances or knowledge of the game. “They can still try it,” she says. “It’s so much fun once you start.”Thompson believes the key to the fun of the sessions is for him to channel his inner child. “If you don’t go into their world, you’ve lost them,” he says.He sweeps aside cricketing jargon to produce an experience that captivates children, drawing on decades of coaching and playing involvement, as well as his experiences coaching the blind and those with other disabilities.Thompson fine-tuned his approach when he ran a project in Hackney. “We went into some serious estates where it was all concrete,” he remembers. “I knew that old-fashioned cricket coaching simply wouldn’t work there – the children would have just walked away.”So he introduced tape-ball cricket and speedy, 20-ball games. Nodding at the nearby football stadium, he says that he injected some of football’s speed and excitement to lure inner-city children away from that game and towards cricket.He is full of praise for the support of his charity backer. “Chance to Shine is one of the most wonderful, wonderful things that has ever happened to cricket,” he says. “If it wasn’t for Chance to Shine, state school cricket would be dying.”It is people like Thompson who keep it alive. He believes that, taught correctly, cricket can be “a vehicle to steer children away from crime and antisocial behaviour and towards the right paths”.A passionate, tireless worker, he now hopes to get government backing to take his work into young offenders’ institutions – something Chance to Shine is also looking in to. “I think I could really help,” he says. “I’d like to use cricket to steer young offenders away from crime and get them off welfare.”For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy. A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels - from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

She was running for office at her students’ union, finishing coursework and preparing for her final exams. “I had to say I’m going to take a break.”For the past two years, Thomas-Asante, co-president for democracy and education at Soas University of London student union, has attended meetings, panel discussions and focus groups, created mentoring schemes, organised events, listened to the problems experienced by BAME students and liaised between them and academic staff.At first, she did so voluntarily, but it is now a paid role after she was advised by a BAME staff member not to work for free. While she loves doing the job and values the way the university involves students in addressing the attainment gap, she says it’s a lot of psychological pressure. “Just because it’s paid doesn’t mean it’s any less difficult. It’s an immense amount of work that you cannot do alone. It’s not enough always for universities to say the work is being done because students are doing it,” she says.It is not only BAME students who bear the brunt of schemes to address inequality – academic staff from under-represented groups feel it too. Kalwant Bhopal, professor of education and social justice at the University of Birmingham, says that if there are issues around race and racial inequality “there seems to be an expectation that this should fall as a burden on BAME groups”. While she is interested and passionate about race (her research focus is minority ethnic academics in higher education and she recently published a book on white privilege), she says: “even if I wasn’t, there has always been an expectation on me that I should be doing BAME work”.Although Bhopal is now a senior academic, she still sometimes feels she is a tick-box presence on a panel. She also says much of the work towards gaining race equality charter awards can fall on BAME staff, often without recognition in workload allocations or promotion paths.“The BAME attainment gap should be something everyone should be working to address, not just a particular group,” she says.This has become more pressing since the Office for Students, which regulates universities, introduced targets to eliminate gaps between different students in access and attainment. The aim is that within 20 years such gaps should be gone.Last month the Centre for Transforming Access and Student Outcomes in Higher Education was set up by King’s College London, Nottingham Trent University and a public-private agency, the Behavioural Insights Team. It aims to collect data and to research the kinds of interventions most likely to be effective. It will focus on inequalities experienced by a number of minority groups, not only in terms of race but social class, care leavers, students estranged from their parents, refugees and gypsy and traveller groups.Susannah Hume, director of the establishment phase of the centre and associate director for What Works at King’s College London, says awareness of inequalities has been around for a while but it is only recently that improvements in collecting and publishing data have shown how bad they are. The aim is to identify concrete solutions, based on research, and to supply evidence to back up the good work taking place.“There are a lot of things institutions do, but the evidence base around whether they are changing outcomes for the students is low,” she says.While the centre will focus on finding evidence, Hume recognises the need for cultural change in institutions so that people act on the evidence – and in a way that does not create other problems. “It’s a challenge to be mindful of the fact that you need both to be engaging people about things that affect them but not demand too much of their time,” she says.This has been recognised as an issue in relation to gender. In a journal article published earlier this year, Bruce Macfarlane and Damon Burg described the “academic housework trap”, where female academics tend to feel more responsibility than men to act as mentors and to advance the cause of gender equality, particularly in science, where women are under-represented. The researchers suggest the extra work involved can slow women’s career paths.Amatey Doku, vice president at the National Union of Students, says staff who are in a minority can find it hard to speak up when they need support. “It’s not the case that academics don’t want to do this, but if it is not acknowledged in the broader system it ends up being a bigger burden on them and reproducing some of the inequalities,” he says.He would like to see the work by BAME staff and students being formalised, so that they are given recognition and training. “You are asking students to give their expertise where in other areas you would pay consultants,” he says. “So you should pay them or give them a placement so they have something to show for it.”Many institutions already do this. Coventry University offers paid internships and mentors for students working with course teams to refresh the curriculum to make it more inclusive. At Nottingham Trent University, student mentors are paid to guide students through their first year and arrange activities. Thomas-Asante says the way her fellow students open up and confide in her “is a beautiful thing” but it can be mentally exhausting. “We engage with the racial attainment gap in terms of numbers,” she says. “But these are people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2e7693e8059f694f1db06bc198481a4bbdc8e0a/0_280_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41f16d90ae8f0e59ece6313f5533421b","title":"revealed amazon deforestation driven global greed meat brazil","story":"Investigation exposes how Brazil’s huge beef sector continues to threaten health of world’s largest rainforestThe cows grazed under the midday Amazon sun, near a wooden bridge ning a river. It was an idyllic scene of pastoral quiet, occasionally broken by a motorbike growling on the dirt road that cuts through part of the Lagoa do Triunfo cattle farm to a nearby community.But this pasture is land that the farm has been forbidden to use for cattle since 2010, when it was embargoed by Brazil’s government environment agency Ibama for illegal deforestation. Nearby were more signs of fresh pasture: short grass, feeding troughs, and salt for cattle.The vast 145,000-hectare (358,302-acre) farm is one of several owned by the company AgroSB Agropecuária SA – known in the region as Santa Bárbara. Located in an environmentally protected area, Lagoa do Triunfo is more than 600km (372 miles) from the capital of the Amazon state of Pará on the western fringes of Brazil’s “agricultural frontier” – where farming eats into the rainforest. To get there takes hours of driving along dirt roads and a ferry ride from nearby São Félix do Xingu, a cattle town accessible only by plane until a few decades ago.AgroSB supplies cattle to JBS, the world’s biggest meat packing company and single biggest supplier of beef, chicken and leather globally, with 350,000 customers in more than 150 countries.A joint investigation by the , Repórter Brasil and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that during 2018, the Lagoa do Triunfo farm delivered hundreds of heads of cattle to other farms also owned by AgroSB for fattening. Cattle was sent from those farms to slaughter in JBS plants.Embargos are imposed for environmental violations, such as farmers or landowners cutting down trees and deforesting illegally,  and serve both as a punishment and protective measure to allow land to recover. Between 2010-2013 at least 12 areas of land on Lagoa do Triunfo were embargoed, and Ibama fined AgroSB more than $18m (£14m) – at current rates – for deforestation on the Lagoa do Triunfo farm.Our investigative team visited land clearly demarcated as embargoed on government websites, and found cows grazing there. A farm worker said cattle were allowed to roam in areas employees knew were embargoed. “You can’t cut down the vegetation,” the employee said. “The vegetation grows and we work the cattle inside.”  is withholding their name in case of retaliation.Work by Stockholm-based NGO Trase, seen exclusively by our team, this week reveals the extent to which the international demand for beef is driving deforestation, with thousands of hectares of Amazon being felled every year to provide meat for world markets.AgroSB is a powerful farming empire owned by the Opportunity group, co-founded by Daniel Dantas, a controversial businessman Bloomberg described as the “bad boy” of Brazilian finance. It owns half a million hectares across Pará and has long attracted controversy. Over the past decade, AgroSB has been accused of illegal deforestation, keeping workers in slave-like conditions, and spraying a community occupying one of its farms with pesticides – accusations it has strongly denied.Scandal has also surrounded JBS, which is supplied by AgroSB. In 2017, following an Ibama investigation, the meat company was fined $7.7m for buying cattle from farms with embargoed areas, including another farm owned by AgroSB. The company pledged to stop buying cattle from the farm.That same year, Joesley Batista, CEO of its controlling company, almost brought down the government of President Michel Temer after secretly recording him appearing to endorse bribery – Temer was indicted but never tried and has always denied the charges, claiming the recording was edited. Joesley and his brother Wesley, then JBS CEO, admitted an extensive web of bribery in a plea bargain deal. In an email, a spokesman for AgroSB said any deforestation had occurred before the company acquired Lagoa do Triunfo in 2008. “AgroSB does not carry out deforestation in order to increase its area, but rather it recovers degraded areas. This brings social and environmental progress for all, because in the same area it is possible to produce more, without deforestation, in respect to the environment,” the spokesman said.“AgroSB’s business model is anchored in the acquisition of degraded open and pastured areas, which are fertilised, reclaimed and transformed into high-intensity pastures or grain plantations – which increases food production per hectare and also captures carbon dioxide (CO2) of the atmosphere in the plantations and in more than 250,000 hectares of forests (legal reserve) maintained on its properties.” He pointed out that: “There is no irregularity in the marketingtransfer of livestock.”With a population of 125,000 and more than two million cattle, the town of São Félix do Xingu, the capital of Pará state, covers an area bigger than Scotland. Cattle farming fed its growth from remote Amazon outpost to busy town, and there are clear signs of wealth here.Just outside town, big money was being splashed at a horse racing meet in a field full of 4x4s. As two jockeys spurred their horses down the rudimentary race track, a commentator bellowed and men waved wads of cash as their bets came in.There was more than $35,000 in prizes over two days of racing, said Valdiron Bueno, owner of two agricultural supplies shops and the race organiser. Bueno built his business more than 20 years after arriving here with just the clothes on his back. “It wasn’t easy. I cried a lot,” he said.São Félix do Xingu was mostly forest when Arlindo Rosa, now president of the town’s union of rural producers, arrived in 1993. “There was practically none of this farming … there was no highway, there was nothing,” he said. “People came from outside with the spirit to raise cattle,” said his vice-president, Francisco Torres, who arrived in 1987.Both men were critical of what they saw as overzealous environmental controls. Torres criticised Ibama as a “fines industry”, borrowing a phrase from President Jair Bolsonaro, who has dismantled environment protection and enjoys support from farmers like these. “How are you going to work if you can’t deforest an area, principally a small one?” said Rosa.But the embargos do not appear to have affected AgroSB’s business, the  and Réporter Brasil investigation found.A spokesman told the  via email: “JBS has a responsible purchase policy for raw materials and does not purchase animals from farms involved in deforestation of native forests, invasion of indigenous reserves or environmental conservation areas, or that are embargoed by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama).”Official state documents seen by the  and Repórter Brasil show that from January to October 2018, Santa Bárbara delivered at least 296 cattle from the Lagoa do Triunfo farm to its Espiríto Santo farm in Xinguara, in the same state.Between July and December 2018, Santa Bárbara sent least 1,977 cattle from the Espiríto Santo farm to two JBS slaughterhouses in Pará. In January at least 936 cattle were sent from the Espírito Santo farm to JBS’s slaughterhouse in Redenção in Pará.Throughout 2018, Santa Bárbara also sent at least 729 cattle from the Lagoa do Triunfo farm to be fattened at its Porto Rico farm in Xinguara. In April 2018, 36 cattle from the Porto Rico farm were sent to slaughter at JBS’s plant in Tucumã in Pará.Growing international demand for beef has become a key driver in the destruction of the Amazon rainforest, with new figures seen by our team revealing the full extent of deforestation directly linked to a handful of major food corporations. Beef linked to deforestation is exported globally, including to key markets in the east Asia and Europe.An investigation by Trase has uncovered how up to 5,800 sq km of forest is being felled in the Amazon and other areas annually to be converted into pasture used for cattle farming, with livestock from deforested areas found to be supplying abattoirs producing beef for global markets.Companies in JBS’s supply chain are potentially responsible for the destruction of between 28,000 and 32,000 hectares (280-320 sq km) of forest each year for exported beef, according to data assembled by Trase. There is no suggestion Lagoa do Triunfo beef is exported. AgroSB state that they purchased the land in 2008, after the deforestation had already happened. JBS points out that it has “one of the largest private supplier monitoring systems in the world… which covers the legal Amazon region.” It has been working on the GTA-Verde concept, which would cover all links in the supply chain and “prevent the entry of cattle from illegally deforested areas into the meat industry”.The latest data shows that deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has been on the rise since 2012. Between August 2017 and July 2018, about 7,900 sq km was destroyed.In the most comprehensive study of its kind ever produced, TRASE used customs, agricultural, sanitary inspection, and deforestation data to map Brazilian cattle exports from the international markets which consume them back to the more than 3000 municipalities where the cattle were raised.The analysis includes data on “indirect” suppliers, which are often intermediate farms that don’t sell directly to abattoirs, but supply other farms which may truck cattle to slaughter. This is a “previously invisible” part of the beef chain, say researchers, which is not monitored for deforestation risks.The supply chain “map” was then cross-referenced with official datasets on pasture expansion, deforestation rates and figures on regional cattle production in order to calculate a deforestation “risk” associated with specific companies and the main international export markets. Because of the high volume of Brazilian beef shipped to China and Hong Kong, these markets are associated with the highest amount of deforestation in total – 16,000 and 22,500 hectares per year – according to the analysis. The EU also imports more than $600m worth of beef from Brazil each year. And that will increase if the EU and member states approve a new trade deal with Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay to gradually let 99,000 tonnes of low-tariff South American beef into Europe every year.Erasmus zu Ermgassen, lead researcher at Trase, said that while some slaughterhouses monitor their direct suppliers, none monitor their indirect suppliers. “There is enormous potential to use land more efficiently and sustainably in the Brazilian beef sector, and to improve rural livelihoods by investing in cattle ranching on existing pasturelands.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/748f6c8735de00142151a8b3242da96a20dd3bff/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2075dd688391996a792c76d9fe01040","title":"worlds biggest youth led conservation scheme begins in wales","story":"Organisers say Penpont project will create blueprint for how youth action and conservation can bring change Twenty young people are embarking on an ambitious conservation project across 2,000 acres of the Brecon Beacons to help tackle the decline in British wildlife.The volunteers are part of the Penpont project, which organisers say is the biggest youth conservation attempt in the world. They will work with tenant farmers, landowners and local people to enhance habitats in order to protect the local flora and fauna.The organisers, Action for Conservation, say they are hoping to create a blueprint for how youth action and conservation can bring change. The charity gives young people from erse backgrounds a chance to take part in environmental action.Hendrikus van Hensbergen, the chief executive of the charity, said he hoped the project would create a game-changing example of how young people can work in collaboration with locals to protect the natural world.“We are at a critical juncture when it comes to our environment,” said Van Hensbergen. “A recent UN report calls for transformative change to avert an extinction crisis.“Now is the time to take positive action to reverse ecological and climate breakdown and there is compelling evidence to show the value of restoring nature to halt bioersity loss and act as a natural climate solution.”The initiative comes as young people have made their voices heard with school strikes and by taking part in direct action with Extinction Rebellion. “There is no better time to build on this energy with a transformative youth-led project here in the UK,” he said. “We hope the Penpont project acts as a beacon of hope and inspiration for like-minded initiatives the world over.”The project will be launched in the Brecon Beacons on Tuesday. Gareth Davies, a tenant farmer whose family have farmed the estate for three generations, said: “We are looking forward to working together with these passionate young people to show how nature restoration can go hand in hand with sustainable farming practices, to make sure we maintain healthy soils, clean water and vital wildlife species long into the future.”The youth leaders will start by undertaking ecological surveys of an initial 322-acre site alongside pupils from neighbouring schools. They plan to draw up restoration projects for the land, and hope to use the project to help educate children.Nature is faring worse in Britain than in many other countries. Populations of endangered animals have declined by two-thirds since 1970, according to a recent report.Deep Shah, a 16-year-old group member from London, said: “More people need to care about our environment in the UK and beyond, and our hope is that this pioneering project will inspire others to follow in our footsteps and spark a chain reaction of similar projects.

Given this support and City’s reticence to meet the asking price, United are the favourites to sign the defender. Leicester’s demand for the 26-year-old is believed to exceed the £75m Liverpool paid Southampton for Virgil van Dijk in January last year. Maguire has told his club’s board he would like a move and his preference is thought to be to join City. The England international hopes he will not be priced out of a transfer.The finance remains available for United to make a serious move for Maguire despite the club having spent a combined initial £60m on Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James.Although City view Leicester’s stance as unrealistic, it remains to be seen whether they may be drawn into a bidding war for Maguire. When Pep Guardiola became manager in summer 2016 he identified Everton’s John Stones as his No 1 target. After initially resisting the valuation of the centre-back, City did eventually pay around £47m for him.The previous summer the club followed a similar pattern regarding Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling – eventually agreeing a total £49m transfer – yet City did drop interest in Van Dijk because of Southampton’s valuation.United have not given up hope David de Gea will sign a new contract, though club and player remain some distance from an agreement.De Gea’s terms expire next summer after United were forced to trigger the goalkeeper’s one-year extension clause. The Spaniard’s representatives are in discussions with United’s hierarchy. Ed Woodward, the club’s executive vice-chairman, and Matt Judge, the head of corporate development, remain optimistic De Gea can be persuaded to commit his future.Any new offer would place De Gea in a similar pay bracket to Paul Pogba, who earns around £290,000 a week. De Gea is in a powerful negotiating position as United do not want him to leave for free next summer. If the 28-year-old refuses to sign a deal United may try to sell him in the current window to recoup a fee.United are continuing the search for a technical director, who will assist in the long-term strategy of the club, but Rio Ferdinand, who had been in the frame, is now thought to be only an outside candidate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14e8417e10accd4c01fae48a061eab430ad9468e/0_121_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25e624bd428d4c928466e6eb3fdeaf09","title":"stina blackstenius sweden world cup semi final netherlands","story":"At the start of the year, Stina Blackstenius had had enough. She had been with Montpellier since the summer of 2017 but after a promising start she had fallen out of favour and decided to move home to Sweden and Linköping, the club she had left 18 months earlier.For some it would have been an admission of failure, but not for Blackstenius. For the Sweden striker it was a chance to take stock and play regularly again with a World Cup coming up. The difficult time in France had been the first serious setback in a career that had seen her win the Under-19 European championship as the tournament’s leading scorer with six goals in 2015 and finish second in the Olympics the following year.Back in Linköping the goals started to flow and with that her confidence returned. She was still questioned when the World Cup started and throughout the group stage. After the first three games in France she had not scored, taking her goal drought for the national side past a year.But then came the release. In the 55th minute in the last-16 match against Canada she timed her run to perfection to connect with a delicious Kosovare Asllani through‑ball to score the only goal and send Sweden through to a meeting with Germany.In that game she went one better by scoring the winner against opposition Sweden had lost to in their past 11 competitive meetings and not defeated for 24 years. Sweden had come from behind to do so – and the relief was clear afterwards.“Of course it has been frustrating,” Blackstenius, who is preparing to take on the Netherlands in the semi-final on Wednesday, said. “I have really waited for this goal for a long time and it means a lot to me.Before the World Cup Blackstenius said that being back in Sweden had made her feel more at ease. “My confidence wasn’t very good when I came back from France so I have had to work quite a lot on that. The fact that I was playing regularly at Linköping has meant a huge amount.“But I have also managed to focus on the things I know I am good at and I have kept repeating them things I feel comfortable about.”Blackstenius started playing football with her older brother, Oscar, in a team managed by her father, Magnus, but it was not until she was 15 that she decided to focus on the sport. Until then she had also played a lot of handball but after a season scoring 38 goals for Vadstena in the third ision she joined Linköping in the top flight in 2013.She has always been a fighter, working hard with her tireless running. Throughout her spell without scoring for Sweden she has had the backing of the coach, Peter Gerhardsson.Blackstenius did not feature in the second group game against Thailand, with Anna Anvegård playing up front, but was back in the starting XI against the USA and has not looked back.Against the Netherlands she is certain to start and Sweden will rely on her and Sofia Jakobsson to trouble a shaky defence with their long and difficult-to-track runs. Sweden will be without the suspended Fridolina Rolfö and will miss the Wolfsburg player’s aggressiveness down the left. Lina Hurtig is expected to replace her.Gerhardsson has been cautiously optimistic about the game against what he calls his “favourite team”. “When I was 15 I watched the Netherlands against Germany and this is one of my best football experiences,” he said on Monday. “I was fascinated by Dutch football.”If Sweden are to have a chance, Blackstenius will surely play a key role. She is back among the goals and do not want to stop now.

The London club have agreed a fee of €62m (£55.45m) plus €10m in add-ons for the midfielder, which would shatter their transfer record – the £42m paid to Ajax for Davinson Sánchez in 2017.The 22-year-old’s personal terms are not expected to be a problem and, although the deal is not done, Spurs are confident they are poised to secure Mauricio Pochettino’s No 1 summer target.Spurs have come to believe that despite late interest from Manchester United, Ndombele wants to join them. Pochettino has convinced him that the next step of his career would be best served at Spurs and Ndombele was impressed when shown around the training ground.Jean-Michel Aulas, the Lyon chairman, has maintained that Ndombele is worth €75m and, if the deal proceeds as expected, he will have virtually got his price. What Spurs will get is a player to quicken the pulse, a central midfielder to replace Mousa Dembélé, mixing skill and electric dribbling with raw power.Roma are considering a move for the Spurs centre-half Toby Alderweireld, and the idea has been floated that the Italian club’s midfielder Nicolò Zaniolo could be part of a deal. That would involve Spurs paying a surplus because Alderweireld is available for £25m this month under a clause in his contract and Zaniolo, a 20-year-old prospect, is rated in the £40m bracket.Spurs are open to bids for the full-backs Kieran Trippier and Danny Rose and they have put them forward to Roma, only to be told there is no interest in either player. But Roma would be open to taking Alderweireld, who has entered the final year on his contract and can be signed for £25m – provided that the transfer is completed at least 14 days before this summer’s window closes on 8 August.Roma, who finished sixth in Serie A, are looking for one or two central defenders after selling Kostas Manolas to Napoli for €36m and they also like Marc Bartra at Real Betis. Alderweireld is weighing up whether to see out the final year on his deal at Spurs.Zaniolo is on Spurs’ wish-list after his breakthrough season at Roma and the London club have held talks with his representatives. There remains the expectation that Spurs will sell their playmaker Christian Eriksen, which would greatly help to balance the books, after he announced that he wanted a new challenge at another club. Real Madrid are interested in him, as are Juventus whose new manager, Maurizio Sarri, is a big fan.Trippier’s future has been under the spotlight and, if he leaves, it could see Spurs move for either the Norwich right-back Max Aarons or Fulham’s Steven Sessegnon. Spurs are keen to sign Sessegnon’s twin brother, Ryan, also of Fulham, who is rated at £25m.Tottenham have completed the signing of the winger Jack Clarke from Leeds for around £10m, rising to a possible £11.5m, and have loaned the 18-year-old back to Elland Road for the 2019-20 season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed413c1c4fb4c6884513c1b6c9e7aeb63202bcd1/0_54_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9081c37fc15c10e9b74331cc80e0ba71","title":"where are you watching the womens world cup semi finals and with whom","story":"If you’re a fan of the World Cup and will be watching it with friends and family, we’d like to hear from you England face the USA on Tuesday, with many hoping their team reaches the final on Sunday.

It is a towering tribute to an ideology that economists and Mormon church members credit for making Utah the most equal state in America.The granary looms over Welfare Square, made up of a small supermarket with half a dozen shelves stocked with pantry staples for the needy. With a note from a local bishop, anyone – church member or not – can walk in and fill up on groceries at no charge. There’s also a cheese factory and a secondhand clothing shop. All of this contributes to a powerful private welfare system that distributes tens of millions of dollars in cash and goods a year around the world – the church also sends food and aid to its congregations in Asia and Africa.What could be described as a little slice of socialism in the Rocky Mountain west partly explains what has given Utah one of the lowest rates of US economic inequality. Utah also ranks top for upward income mobility. In the new Gilded Age, when inequality has reached decades-high levels, what’s the lesson in Mormonism?April Young Bennett, a petite, blue-eyed mother of four, is a devout Mormon and a feminist, two belief systems that often clash. She explains that Mormon families like hers are expected to fast for two meals each month, and donate the cost of those meals to the welfare fund.“I know many people who have used it when they’ve gone through a short-term problem. It might be a orce. It might be losing their job, something that causes short-term poverty,” she says.A smart woman with a quick laugh in a Salt Lake cafe also told of how the church paid her rent on a new place for three months, which allowed her to leave an abusive marriage. Over the phone, another man in Utah with three young kids said food from the bishop’s storehouse kept his family going when he lost his construction job. Other church members said the no-strings-attached funds carried them though circumstances that could have spiraled into disaster and poverty. All declined to have their names published for fear of stigma. Their reluctance might reveal something more about the church’s welfare programs: it’s admirable to give it’s perhaps less admirable to receive.A notable exception is the former mayor of Salt Lake County, now a first-term congressman, the Democrat Ben McAdams. A Mormon church member, he is open about his family’s financial struggles in the 80s, after the crumbling of his parents’ marriage left them broke. McAdams became a tireless advocate for poverty alleviation programs, and credits socioeconomic equality practices within the church for leveling the playing field.“We lived paycheck to paycheck,” he told me. There were times the power company turned off the electricity there were foreclosure notices and stretches when the family had no health insurance. “I remember mom always having to juggle,” he says. In those periods, the family got through with food from Welfare Square and relied on the church to pay overdue utility bills.The doctrine of Mormon generosity and sharing goes back to the church’s beginnings, when faithful believers fled westward to avoid government persecution. The ideology of self-sufficiency and mistrust of the government runs deep in the Rockies, well beyond the Mormon church. There are hundreds of books and theories about why, but the easiest answer has something to do with the type of people who have chosen to live in this sparse, rugged land, eke out a living and remain here.In the 19th century, Mormons tested out many experiments with collectivism, while also denying an influence of socialism. Several groups lived in a collective system known as the United Order, where property, goods and profits were communal, an effort to equalize wealth and eliminate poverty. Polygamy was also common in these communities until the church officially outlawed it in 1890.And therein lies one of the critical flaws with the model of Mormon generosity: while Utah ranks high on equality overall and in terms of social mobility for children, it ranks last in economic equality for women.Young Bennett advocates for women to be allowed into the ministry and says a critical problem with the church’s temporary assistance programs is the lack of gender equity. Women who may seek the funds after a orce are frowned upon in a culture that prizes family unity. They are often forced to share personal stories and embarrassing details with the men in charge at local church wards – men who are often friends or relatives of their husbands.“I think there are a lot of good things about the system, except that it’s only administered by men,” she said. “It’s very gendered in terms of who makes the decisions.”During his time as mayor, McAdams went undercover for three nights as a homeless person, sleeping on the streets to better understand the challenges people face in finding food, shelter and solutions. It is hard to imagine a mayor of a major city doing this anywhere but Utah, where church doctrine influences political moves.Professor Ram Cnaan of the University of Pennsylvania, who has studied Mormon volunteerism and charity, has found church members donate more time and money than most, even most religious people. “We have found an unbelievable amount of volunteering. It’s clear they do a lot for the congregation, but they do a lot for society in general,” says Cnaan.There’s a trend in America now for people with money to distance themselves from the poor, to put up gated communities and shun the homeless. But based on Utah’s example, cities would do well to think of ways to pull together for the common good.McAdams admits poverty is a difficult issue to understand, but says simple first steps can go a long way toward stabilizing vulnerable people. Some people need a short-term gap filler to avoid disastrous consequences. “I think our system makes it hard for people to lift themselves up,” he says.•This article was amended on 2 July 2019. Ben McAdams is a former mayor of Salt Lake County, not Salt Lake City."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35ebcd9b46ba7e324edf8c8030b3724200ba8736/0_59_1964_1178/master/1964.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce18a2323bdf9fca264d10dd4fd4b7df","title":"our traditional garment is not spandex kim kardashian west renames brand amid outcry","story":"Reality TV star had drawn widespread criticism from critics accusing her of disrespecting Japanese cultureKim Kardashian West has confirmed she is renaming her new Kimono line of shapewear after widespread criticism over the brand’s name.Kardashian West, 38, drew accusations of cultural appropriation after she detailed plans for the brand last week. Critics said the name “kimono” disrespected Japanese culture and disregarded the significance behind the traditional outfit.On Monday Kardashian West announced on Twitter she was changing the name. She she would “be in touch soon” with a new brand name – but did not say what that would be.She wrote: “My brands and products are built with inclusivity and ersity at their core and after careful thought and consideration, I will be launching my Solutionwear brand under a new name. I will be in touch soon.”Yuka Ohishi, a San Francisco-based videographer who helped spread the hashtag #KimOhNo, decrying the brand’s name, told the  she had not expected Kardashian West to cave in to the pressure.Ohishi said she hoped celebrities and brands would think twice and “do their research to understand what cultural significance items or concepts have”. She said: “Diversity and representation is very different from cultural appropriation, and it’s going to be an ongoing conversation for all of us.”Daisaku Kadokawa, the mayor of Kyoto, wrote a letter to Kardashian West last week, asking her to reconsider the trademark on Kimono. His staff is working to register “Kimono culture” on Unesco intangible cultural heritage list, he said.He wrote: “Kimono is a traditional ethnic dress fostered in our rich nature and history with our predecessors’ tireless endeavours and studies, and it is a culture that has been cherished and passed down with care in our living. We think that the names for ‘kimono’ are the asset shared with all humanity who love kimono and its culture therefore they should not be monopolized.”Kardashian West’s new line is a collection of skin-tone colored shapewear akin to Spanx that she claimed to have been working on for a year.

But in real life, falling for your best friend doesn’t always go so smoothlyIt was supposed to go the way things do in the movies. Nora would tell her best friend that she loved him, he would feel the same way and then they would kiss – preferably in the rain. So when the 30-year-old arts manager declared her love for her best friend when they were still teenagers, she expected a happy ending. “I was so convinced that if you’re best friends and one of you starts getting feelings, the other person would match you.” Sadly, that was not to be the case.“I said: ‘I’m in love with you and we should give it a go,’” Nora remembers, “and he couldn’t really meet my eye. I was like: ‘Oh God, oh God, I’ve made a massive mistake!’” He said some kind words and let her down gently. Humiliated, Nora began to cry.If there is one thing pop culture can agree on, it is that platonic friendship can turn to great romance – hence the genre-defining When Harry Met Sally, Ross’s mad airport dash in Friends and Ron and Hermione’s marriage in the Harry Potter novels.“You see that trope again and again,” Nora says. “They’re like brother and sister, then something magical happens and they start to see that person differently.” But, in real life, things don’t always work out well. What is the best way to tell a friend you are in love with them?Sit with your feelings for a while, advises Simone Bose, a relationship therapist at Relate. “If you are going to take that step, ask yourself: are you serious about this?” Look for signals that they might be romantically interested in you. “Is it an intense friendship? Does it sometimes feel like boundaries are crossed?” Clues might be if you keep touching each other, or avoid talking about sexual partners around them.Nora wishes she had read the signs. “He hadn’t given me any indication that he was interested in me romantically at all, and friends had tried to say that to me very gently, but I wasn’t hearing it.”Keith, who is 61 and from Bristol, has loved a close friend for more than a decade, during which time he has even put her in his will – but has decided against telling her. “I love her to bits,” he explains, “but I daren’t bring that up because it could unhinge what we currently have.” He does his best to be philosophical: “Hey ho – we don’t always get what we want.”Perhaps he needs a “Cupid”. That’s how Janette Miller, 76, describes the man who helped her towards a very happy 30-year marriage. “Miles was 34 and I was 21 we met when we were learning to ice skate. Miles became my friend and dance partner for eight years. But, to him, I was just a pair of skates on legs. One day, our mutual friend Noel told me I ought to marry Miles. I said that he would be perfect, but he never saw me that way. Luckily for me, Noel had said the same thing to Miles – and Miles then started to court me.”If you are unsure whether your best friend may have feelings for you, Bose has a simple solution. “Flirt! Try and get a gauge on whether they’re reacting in a positive way, or if they look really uncomfortable.” Be warned: the flirting may go over their head. When 28-year-old publicist Asher Alexander, from Barnet, asked his best friend, Rae, to the cinema, he thought it was clear he was asking her on a date. But his intentions were lost on her. “After the movie, I said: ‘Look, we should make this an official thing and date properly.’” Rae was so shocked she laughed in his face. Happily, she softened over time six years later, they are getting married.What you shouldn’t do is tell your friend you love them when you are drunk or high. “You can behave in a more emotionally catastrophic way,” Bose warns. “Things can get out of hand quite quickly. So have the confidence to share your feelings when you’re sober.” Keira, 28, learned this the hard way after confessing her feelings for her best friend after taking MDMA on a night out. “It wasn’t just like: ‘I’m high and I’m just saying this because I’m high,’” the editor, from London, clarifies. “I genuinely believed it at the time. I’d been thinking it for ages and blurted it out before I’d processed it.” He responded positively and they made plans to go on a date. But as it neared, Keira started having doubts. “I’d think: ‘Do I actually fancy him? He’s a great guy, but I couldn’t imagine us having sex.’” So she did something she profoundly regrets: she ghosted him. “It is probably the absolute worst thing I’ve ever done to a friend.”Alex, 27, who works in the fashion industry, fell in love with his best friend. When they met in 2015, “it was love at first sight”. They bonded over everything – their childhoods, values and favourite photographers. “I connected with him in a way that I have connected with few human beings on this Earth.” But Alex has never said anything. Why? Because his friend is straight. “There was nothing to be gained from telling him, because I knew he didn’t like me in that way.”Eventually, Alex had to take a step back from the friendship because it became too painful. He knows he made the right choice. “I believe he knows and, in my heart of hearts, I believe he did love me back in some way. He used to say I was like his soulmate, or brother – like a soul brother. I didn’t believe in love at first sight or soulmates until I met him. If there’s a platonic version of a soul mate …” He tails off. “The connection was very strong and very real.”Be mindful of how you transition from a physical relationship to a sexual one. For 31-year-old copywriter Tom, who has been in a relationship with his best friend for two years, it came easily. “The sex was totally mental and as soon as that happened we were both like: ‘Well, if we’re best mates and the sex is mental ... we’ve been inseparable ever since.” But what if the sex feels awkward, like you’re kissing your brother or sister? “Go with the flow and what your desires are, rather than forcing it,” says the sex therapist Miranda Christophers. If at any point it doesn’t feel right, take some time out. “Think about why it’s not feeling right. Focus on that feeling and ask yourself: ‘Am I just feeling nervous, or is it actually that I don’t really want to be doing this?’ In which case, you need to remember that they are your friend, first and foremost, and you should be honest with them and say: ‘It’s not feeling right.’”When things go right, falling in love with your best friend can be magical. “I have nothing to hide from her,” says Alexander. “I can be my most complete self, and open, and I never have to succumb to any of that bullshit toxic masculinity where I have to ‘be the man’.”The downside? “It can be claustrophobic,” says Tom. “Sometimes we’ll be having a tiff and our group WhatsApp will go off and I see her respond to it – even though she’s ignoring my messages.” Alexander has never been able to keep a secret from Rae, because she knows him so well. “She’s so good at reading me – from my tone of voice to my facial expression. It’s just really hard to keep things on the downlow. I don’t think I’ve ever got her a surprise gift without her knowing what it is a week before.”And what if the relationship doesn’t work out? In a word: communicate. “Say: ‘This is hard, but let’s work this out, because we want to be friends,’” Bose advises. “That can be tricky, because once you’ve gone over the line it’s hard to go back. But it’s not impossible.” Ellen, a 26-year-old HR manager from Ashford, is proof you can transition back to friendship amicably. She discovered her love for her best friend like they do in the movies – by kissing him in the rain. (It was less cinematic than it sounds: they were drunk, waiting for a night bus and standing beside some bins.) After three years of dating, they broke up in 2016. “The passion had gone and it was back to us being friends again.” As they both felt the same way at the same time, the breakup was frictionless. “Our friendship is still as strong. I can talk to him about anything at any time.”Some names and identifying details have been changed.

They met on a Russian-language websiteIn 2015, Emma joined a language website. She was looking for someone to practise her Russian with and she didn’t want a boyfriend – besides, she already had one. It quickly became clear many people were on there to flirt or get together. “When I saw Dmitry’s profile picture, I expanded it to see whether he looked like he might be a bit sleazy,” she says with a laugh. But he was, she says, “the first person I met who seemed relatively normal”.They started talking by Skype, about twice a week. Was there a spark? “I don’t think I thought of you in any romantic terms,” Emma says to Dmitry. “We were very clear this was just about language. I liked you and I thought you had a nice smile, but I didn’t think anything else.” Dmitry says his “mood was better every time after we’d had a chat. I felt really positive. But I think it started only when we finally met in person.”A year later, they met in St Petersburg, where Emma had gone for a 10-day language course. She spent three days with Dmitry and his brother. “We never actually spent any time alone together,” she says. She admits to thinking he was “quite good-looking. Because I was in a relationship, I suppressed it. I think I also thought: ‘What’s the point? He’s in Russia, so it wouldn’t work anyway.’”Apart again, they started to text more frequently. “I noticed I was thinking about her all the time,” says Dmitry. “I was trying to engage in different things and I tried to deny the whole idea I had feelings for her, because I thought: what are the chances for us to be together?” He tried not to text Emma, but lasted all of two weeks. One morning, he sent a text asking: “Do you think we’d be good in a relationship?” Emma had been thinking about him, too. She broke up with her boyfriend and they started messaging “pretty much continuously”. “At some point, we realised we should meet again and spend time together, just us,” says Dmitry.Emma went to St Petersburg in September 2016. “I worried that maybe it was an infatuation and that spending time together would make us realise it wouldn’t work,” she says. “The first few days, it felt a bit awkward – we weren’t in a relationship, we didn’t know whether to hold hands or not. As time went on it got more comfortable and by the end of the holiday we were like: OK, let’s give it a go.”It was difficult for Dmitry to get a visa to the UK, so they met in between every three months in countries such as Georgia and the Czech Republic. This continued for 18 months until they decided to get married, which they did in Moscow in February last year. Dmitry was introduced to Emma’s family the night before at the airport Emma met her new mother-in-law for the first time in the taxi on the way to the register office.Back in the UK, she started the long process of getting a spouse visa for Dmitry, who had had to stay in Russia. At the same time, the novichok poisonings were unfolding and relations between the UK and Russia were breaking down. “All my friends were like: ‘Do you think that’s going to affect the visa decision?’ and I said: ‘Of course not Dmitry’s not an oligarch or anything,’” says Emma. “But I got a bit nervous – and then we got rejected.”They were told Dmitry’s English language qualification wasn’t valid, even though it was. “It was really stressful,” says Emma. “I didn’t know if it was a mistake or they were rejecting him for some other reason.”A month later, as they were about to start the expensive and time-consuming reapplication, the Home Office said their case had been reviewed and they were granted a visa. Dmitry arrived in the UK three weeks later they had been apart for five months. “We’re really happy,” says Emma. “It’s really nice not having to look at each other on a screen.”Want to share your story?

Other highly paid sports pundits include Jermaine Jenas on £210,000 a year and Ian Wright on £205,000, while John McEnroe is paid £190,000 for taking part in the BBC’s Wimbledon coverage.While many leading male news and current affairs presenters – including Huw Edwards, Jeremy Vine and Nicky Campbell – took substantial pay cuts following a public outcry over their salaries, the sports department instead increased the amount it pays to on-screen pundits such as Shearer and Wright in the past year.The BBC director general, Tony Hall, defended Lineker’s salary and said he provided value for money for viewers.The figures, contained in the corporation’s annual report, will come under increased scrutiny after the BBC announced plans to scrap the free TV licence for most over-75s, arguing it needed the money to protect investment in programming.The BBC chairman, David Clementi, blamed the government for the licence fee decision. “This was not a decision we wanted to take and it was a decision we were required to take by legislation,” he said.Clementi also said it was “nonsense” to suggest cutting the salaries of leading stars would cover the cost of providing the benefit to over-75s, saying: “The sums don’t add up.”He insisted the corporation did not overpay senior staff. “On management, there is absolutely no evidence we are paying our excellent people above the market. All the evidence is the reverse,” Clementi said.The total amount the BBC paid all on-air talent rose by almost £11m in the past year to £158.6m.With market conditions in the media industry tough, the BBC also hired more than 1,000 new staff, taking the number to 19,231. In total, the number of employees at the corporation, including in commercial operations such as BBC Studios, grew from 21,431 to 22,401.The corporation has struggled with pay since it was forced to disclose the salaries of all staff who are paid more than £150,000 a year. The first annual disclosure in 2017 exposed the radical differences in salaries between many leading on-air men and women.Since then, many leading BBC men have been shamed into taking substantial pay cuts, with the salary of the outgoing Today programme presenter John Humphrys falling by £110,000. Radio 2’s Steve Wright cut his pay by £75,000 and Jeremy Vine took a £150,000 reduction.However, a handful of male presenters such as Chris Evans – who took home £8,500 a time for presenting the BBC Radio 2 breakfast show – have instead chosen to leave the corporation.The BBC’s highest-paid woman is Zoe Ball, the new Radio 2 breakfast show host, who took home £370,000 in the 12 months to April but will be paid less than Evans. Other female high earners include Claudia Winkleman, Vanessa Feltz and Lauren Laverne.The Woman’s Hour presenter Jane Garvey told the Today programme that “perhaps it would have been better to cut more male salaries rather than to up some female salaries. I absolutely get that.”The BBC Women group urged caution and pointed to many continuing pay disputes. “There has been some progress in the last two years, but many women at all levels of the BBC are locked into slow, inefficient and demoralising internal processes,” it said.“New equal-pay cases are still emerging and staff are yet to have confidence that pay inequality is in the past.”In a press conference, Hall was also asked about the accusation of bias made by Boris Johnson, who renamed the BBC as the “Brexit-bashing corporation”.He said in response: “The BBC is doing a fantastic job in actually describing to the public the choices being made on their behalf about Brexit. You can ask no more of the BBC than that.”The BBC’s annual pay disclosures only cover staff who earn £150,000 a year while working directly for the corporation.They do not include presenters and actors who are employed by independent production companies to make programmes on the BBC’s behalf. As a result, many prominent figures associated with major BBC programmes such as Strictly Come Dancing, Top Gear and Doctor Who – which are made by the commercial BBC Studios arm – do not feature on the list."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84d9037c80fe4683be685999805181479bee34c9/0_202_5029_3017/master/5029.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b108bea546082a4ae1205ddb520dcf08","title":"london house prices uk","story":"Figures for the three months to June from Nationwide showed London and the south-east were the worst performers in a national housing market that has managed to keep growing through the past three years of Brexit turmoil, but only at a modest pace.Most of the slide in London prices has been felt by the owners of expensive properties in the capital, with multimillion-pound homes experiencing the worst falls.Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said: “Housing market trends are likely to continue to mirror developments in the broader economy.“While healthy labour market conditions and low borrowing costs will provide underlying support, uncertainty is likely to continue to act as a drag on sentiment and activity, with price growth and transaction levels remaining close to current levels over the coming months.”“The avoidance of a no-deal Brexit at the end of March may have provided a little support to housing market activity through easing some of the immediate uncertainty and concerns,” he said.“However, we suspect any boost to the housing market from the avoidance of a disruptive Brexit at the end of March will prove limited in both size and length – a view reinforced by the Bank of England reporting that mortgage approvals for house purchases eased back in May after a marked rise in April.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/722649e3b15d41724d4caadd5bbe96cdf4045cc6/0_56_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7da4cf987f517a20956be6675f4eebaa","title":"alex mann the teenage rap fan who lit up glastonbury","story":"Fifteen-year-old rattled through every word of Dave’s complex Thiago Silva tuneOn Sunday afternoon, Alex Mann was an ordinary teenage rap fan from England’s smallest city, enjoying himself at his first Glastonbury festival. By Monday morning, he had been plucked from the crowd at the Other Stage to perform flawlessly in front of thousands – and turned into a social media star.The 15-year-old in a bucket hat from Wells, Somerset, set social media alight with his barnstorming appearance alongside Dave as the pair performed the rapper’s track with AJ Tracey, Thiago Silva – named in honour of the Brazil and Paris Saint-Germain football player. It was, Alex told the , “the best time of his life”.In a widely shared BBC video, Dave – full name David Orobosa Omoregie – asked the crowd: “Who is sober enough to sing these lyrics with me?”Alex, sitting on the shoulders of a friend, was wearing a PSG shirt with Silva’s name on the back, and pulled at the club’s emblem as his companions pointed at him, trying to get Dave’s attention.Dave, who spotted Alex gesticulating, said: “I see a PSG shirt over there, but do you know the lyrics?” After Alex responded with a few confident lines, Dave concluded: “He looks like he knows the lyrics … Yeah, let’s take a chance.”As Alex took to the stage, Dave briefly reassured him he would only need to cover AJ Tracey’s part – but instead, Alex rattled through every single word of the complex, quickfire tune without hesitation, drawing an admiring pat on the back from the slightly upstaged Dave, and the adulation of the crowd.On Monday, the  contacted Alex via his mother, who said that he would be able to speak after he had had a sleep. When fully rested, the teenager said he had no hesitation about heading to the stage after Dave called on him. “I thought he might be joking so I thought I’d better get up as quickly as possible,” he said.He added: “I’m not sure what was going through my head. I was so nervous. I thought: ‘What if I mess up?’ But then I went on stage and performed and it felt so good.”By Monday Alex had received a message from Thiago Silva. The footballer, currently preparing for Brazil’s Copa America semi-final against Argentina on Wednesday, congratulated Alex on his performance, and asked for his number to speak over the phone.“I haven’t spoken to him yet, but we’re in different time zones,” Alex said. “I’m not really sure what I will say to him. I really like him as a player, so I’ll probably just say that.”Dave, a rapper, singer, musician and songwriter from south London, whose rich, personal lyrics have won him a string of hits and an Ivor Novello award, has also been in touch.“He was supportive and said that I would get a lot of messages today and if I needed anything to let him know. He said if it got overwhelming he would be there,” Alex said.“I’ve listened to the song plenty of times, to be fair, but I was worried when I went on stage. I didn’t think I would know all the lyrics but I did … I pick up lyrics quite fast,” he said.After the performance, Alex was stunned by the reaction. “I walked off stage and the security guards took me back down and it was just amazing,” he said. “The way security brought me back down was in front of everyone and I was walking past people who were screaming my name. I had the best time of my life.”He admits the attention has been a lot to take in – but so far Alex is taking it in his stride. “Lots of people have started following me on Twitter and Instagram and liking all my posts … I am not going to let it get to my head too much.”It was the teenager’s first time at the festival and he was there with about 20 friends. “I’ve not been before but my mates said it was one of the best Glastonburys so far. It was so hot and there was a really good atmosphere, no one being aggressive. It was just overall good vibes.”He also sought to correct social media claims that he had not been completely sober for the performance. “It’s funny reading the comments,” he said. “If I was drunk I wouldn’t have been able to remember the lyrics like that.”As for the future, Alex said he had never considered trying to turn his performance skills into a career. Instead, he said, he was “just focused on getting it right” on the day. Still, the reaction from the crowd made him realise he had some talent. “I’d be up for performing with him again,” he said. “And being in a video.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc1f94ce5c6269868ca447b567ef67c46525e4ac/0_143_3962_2377/master/3962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=697fa8d5a69c7e299d8931cc1843cef6","title":"love and respect stormzy apologises over glastonbury headline black british","story":"Grime star acknowledges Skunk Anansie singer was first black British artist to headline festival after friendly exchangeBritish grime star Stormzy has apologised for erroneously saying he was the first black British artist to headline Glastonbury music festival on Friday.The rapper, whose real name is Michael Omari, apologised on social media to Skin, the lead singer of Skunk Anansie, after she noted that she had headlined the famous event with her rock band in 1999.In a friendly exchange between the two musicians, Stormzy wrote on Twitter: “No disrespect intended I’m very sorry my apologies! Thank you for paving the way - love (and) respect.”The confusion emerged over the weekend when the 25-year-old claimed on Twitter that he was “the first black British artist to headline Glastonbury”.Skin, whose real name is Deborah Anne Dyer, rebutted his claims in an Instagram post, writing “sorry Stormzy but we beat you to it in 1999!”She also noted her appreciation for the south London-born grime star, adding: “You’re amazing and we’re all very proud”.Stormzy is a cult figure in the British grime scene, which blends Jamaican dancehall and hip hop for a pulsating, hard-edged sound that first electrified London nearly two decades ago.British rockers Skunk Anansie formed in 1994, disbanded in 2001 and then reformed in 2009 – and are currently on tour in Europe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/876ce9afc9d94544332f965c57b1197eb0506e50/0_173_5228_3138/master/5228.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0effd5eeee9e639e71a6d70a8bcd8188","title":"readers glastonbury highlights","story":"From your favourite headliners to surprise delights, you’ve been sharing your top moments from a scorching weekendThe experience was like being taken into a vortex of sound and light with no way out as they transitioned seamlessly between haunting tracks on their most recent album (Free Yourself and Eve of Destruction were especially memorable) to classics like Hey Boy, Hey Girl and Galvanize.They flashed images of both old and new (robotic figures interspersed with black-and-white images) in a hypnotic way, with repetitive elements, so that the audience was truly engrossed and the atmosphere electric. The 3D imagery made you feel as if you were part of it. Light and dark moments in the music and the show took you through a waterfall of emotions, while the beat keept you in ecstasy. A truly unforgettable show, perhaps the best I have seen at Glastonbury. Satya, 26, GloucesterI was really nervous about going to Glastonbury because I’d never been to a festival before – I was there with my parents to celebrate my forthcoming 18th birthday. We waited at the Pyramid stage all day on Friday to see Stormzy, and saw some amazing performances from Bastille and George Ezra. We’re used to watching the headliners on TV so it was quite surreal!I’d decided I wanted to be near to the front for Stormzy but I never thought I’d be so close. His set was absolutely incredible, and all of his singers and dancers were amazing. The highlight of the night – and the whole festival – was when Chris Martin came on for Blinded By Your Grace. It was unforgettable, and I felt like I’d had a real “Glastonbury moment”. Seeing two such different musicians come together really showed me just how amazing the festival is. Megan, 17, LiverpoolAn old litter-picking volunteer with a white beard, dreadlocks and a Lancashire accent, who introduced himself only as “that guy”, did a short set at the open-mic in Strummerville on Saturday afternoon. He had a drum machine and a bass guitar, with which he played some remarkably funky tunes, before adding his own unexpectedly brilliant vocals, most notably in a song I assume was called Put It in the Bin Please, in which he pleaded with the audience in increasingly irate tones to correctly dispose of their rubbish. We’d only gone up there for a snooze in the shade of the trees but came away with a proper Glasto highlight. Russell Carswell, 32, LondonJeff Goldblum’s soundcheck! Warm fuzzy comedy from the king of smooth: guess the animal pattern pants, guess the animal sound, and then the surreal banter with the BBC journalist! When she asks, “When are you going to start?” Jeff casually replies, “Well, I think I already have” to an uproarious, loving crowd. Thanks for an amazing memory Jeff! Gary McKillion, 43, BarnstapleThe IICON stage was absolutely incredible. Obviously I loved the music, but I couldn’t believe how amazing the stage design was. It looked like something out of a dystopian future: proper way to listen to electronic music. Zach, 25, BristolThe Killers absolutely smashed it! We’ve seen them several times, including last year at TRNSMT, so I was initially a little underwhelmed when I saw the lineup … But it was their best performance by far, they put so much effort into it and it was flawless.Being our first Glasto with the kids we were fully prepared for meltdowns, but the children (Holly, eight, and Charlie, five) threw themselves into it and didn’t complain once, despite the heat and all the walking. Seeing them dancing their wee socks off at sunset to Liam Gallagher and the Killers made for such beautiful moments.The Kidzfield is a paradise, they got a photo with lovely Dynamo, who completely captured their imaginations! They spent hours doing arts and crafts, going potholing, playing in forts, and getting decorated with rainbows and glitter. They were really on board with the green focus at this year’s festival, even though they are very young, they recognise the importance. Edwina McNulty, GlasgowSeeing Michael Eavis singing Elvis songs on the Avalon Cafe stage was probably the sweetest moment of Glastonbury. In a relatively intimate setting was the man who made this all happen, singing his heart out at the age of 83 and clearly loving every minute of it. It only got better when Emily joined him for a duet of Something Stupid. Neither have particularly brilliant voices but the music world owes them everything. An utterly charming moment. Simon Donohue, 47, ManchesterThe Acoustic Brass Off on the Truth Stage on Thursday night was an absolute blast, with lots of catchy covers and a great atmosphere. Dat Brass began on stage, belting out Cry Me a River and several other tunes. They then waded into the crowd, where they joined forces with the New York Brass Band for some more fun, playing Thrift Shop and Get Lucky. Double sousaphone equals double fun! Matt, 29, LondonFrank Turner on the Avalon Stage on Friday night. I’d not seen him live before but the energy and desire to put on a great show were incredible. Jonny Ford, 50, LiverpoolThis is about my 25th Glastonbury and the highlight this year was wandering around with my 13-year-old daughter, Cliodhna, on Sunday night. We went to the top of the Ribbon Tower in the Park, which I’d never done before. It’s just fantastic. The whole of gorgeous Glastonbury is laid out before you, a million lights twinkling. All three of my kids have been coming since they were little. We all love it and I hope we’re all there next year at the 50th Glastonbury, as I’ll be 50 too. Jane O’Hara, 49, CharlseworthMy friends and I agonised over whether to see her or the Cure. Halfway through the first song I knew we’d made the right choice. She is the Glasto performer that 2019 deserves: singing and talking about being an outsider, acceptance, joy, sexuality, confusion. She dazzled with on-point choreography, confidence and pitchperfect delivery. It was theatre, dance and music – a real show, a triumph. It helps that she’s very funny, exudes warmth and can build a rapid rapport with the crowd with her slightly off-kilter English. It was a shame so comparatively few people were there to see it. But it gave the show an intimate feel and even a little space to dance. Andy McGrath, 30, StreathamIt was the first time I’ve seen the Cure live – WOW! An amazing performance from a band who showed you really don’t need the bunting and the special guests, just a huge catalogue of amazing songs performed brilliantly by superb musicians and a singer with Robert Smith’s ability to mesmerise. solarevolutionWatching Jorja Smith with my 14-year-old daughter, her eyes filled with happy tears as she looked across at me and mouthed: “This is the happiest I’ve ever been.” In front of us were five 21-year-olds from south Wales at their first Glastonbury. They too were teary, hugging us and telling us how much they wanted to bring their daughters to Glastonbury when they were older, saying how wonderful it was to make such special memories. I’d stewarded that day between 3am and 10am and was knackered! But as the sun (finally) began to dip beneath the horizon the world stopped just for a moment and it was the most beautiful place in the world.

An audience-shot clip of Asher, a British Sign Language interpreter, went viral, showing her gunfinger-happy, head-spinningly dextrous visualisation of the grime MC’s rapidfire lyrics.For Asher, who also interpreted Stormzy at Glastonbury in 2017, it was just another night’s work. “There’s not many interpreters who interpret music and do festivals,” she says. “There’s a shortage nationally.” And there’s even fewer who specialise in grime. “I’ve listened to grime since the Risky Roadz days, since the very beginning, so it’s easier for me, because I understand the context, the slang, all that stuff.”Alongside Asher, Stormzy’s set was also interpreted by Stephanie Raper. Overall, 20 interpreters volunteer their time with Glastonbury’s DeafZone to make sure that key Glastonbury performances are accessible for deaf audiences. With each song taking about a day’s preparation to learn, it’s a mammoth job – made even more difficult by the fact that interpreters don’t have access to setlists before shows. This means they usually look up an artist’s recent sets online, and spend weeks prepping all the songs that might be played. And if the artist goes off-script and plays something new? “We just have to go with it,” says Raper. “It’s about the beat, the words, the melodies, the feeling, the tempo change – it’s just trying your best to relay all that.”For most interpreters, the work begins with immersing themselves in an artist’s world. Paula Cox, who interpreted Janet Jackson’s set, explains that ahead of a gig, she “listens constantly – in the car, in the morning, in the evening, when I’m cooking my dinner. Part of the research is looking on YouTube, and seeing how the artist moves to this song, and what their mood is. If they’ve got a certain way they hold themselves, you want to try and match that.”For Benjamin Gorman, who interpreted his very first set at Glastonbury for Bastille, preparation is more intricate. Gorman is deaf himself and performed with the support of other volunteers giving visual cues. “I had to read as many lyrics as I possibly could,” he explains. “Also, when you sign in BSL, it’s not the same grammar and structure as spoken English, so you need to think about how to change it, but not change it so much that you depart from the original lyrics.”Part of what makes such translations consistently go viral is the sheer emotive power of the performances, stemming from the visually expressive nature of the language. Angela Dawes – who provided BSL interpretation for Christine and the Queens, Billie Eilish, and Loyle Carner – finds it easier to translate when she connects emotionally with a song. “Having an artist you can relate to – that really helps. We want to put that across in our interpretation: how you feel when you listen to a song.”As well as covering main performances, DeafZone also provide “roaming” interpreters who support deaf people accessing other aspects of Glastonbury, such as getting a massage or watching a debate. But DeafZone’s work isn’t only about helping deaf people – it’s also about raising awareness of BSL as a language in the hearing community. Volunteer Abigail Gorman (who is deaf herself) explains that the DeafZone tent provides free BSL classes to all Glastonbury-goers. “We talk about deaf history, culture, language. We don’t want people to just come in and learn a few signs – that’s tokenistic. We want people in the future to campaign on our behalf, be our allies and support us.”The best outcome of these viral videos would be more support for interpreters at festivals – who could benefit from access to setlists and an in-ear audio feed – but also, most importantly, improved access for the deaf festival-goers. The impact of that access can be immeasurable. “The first time I came to Glastonbury, I was a punter, and I didn’t expect anything,” says Gorman. “I’d been to other festivals with limited access – whereas here, it’s inclusive. I’m not ostracised. Festivals need to be more deaf aware. They need to employ deaf people to find out what deaf people need. I face a lot of barriers. There are no barriers here at Glastonbury.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c06485be0d3d1e8d551b3897de64de1532884390/1092_576_4668_2801/master/4668.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3291ebec654e4640ae17af99c8a7d7b","title":"the marriage of figaro review royal opera house london gardiner mcvicar","story":"Royal Opera House, LondonThis revival of David McVicar’s wonderful 2006 production sees an uneven cast and John Eliot Gardiner’s conducting sometimes too overbearingA good performance of Le Nozze di Figaro always has more going for it than most other operatic experiences. The latest Covent Garden revival of David McVicar’s 2006 production is like that. It’s Figaro, so it’s wonderful. But that doesn’t mean it is without problems.McVicar’s staging, updated to the 1820s, is one example. The indoor scenes are taut and full of social insights. The servants are rarely out of sight or mind. And this is very much a reading for the #MeToo era. But there is a dramatic slackness in the always difficult nocturnal final act, which means the opera loses its way until Mozart comes to the rescue in the transcendent final scene.John Eliot Gardiner’s conducting poses another issue. Few know this score better or talk about it more interestingly than he. There is terrific zip and attention to detail, and orchestral insights abound. But Gardiner’s work felt a bit overbearing and self-absorbed, and there was not much kindness to the singers, who are sometimes overwhelmed.Among the men, Christian Gerhaher’s Figaro has a master’s attention to text and vocal nuance, but he seems to be performing in a different opera from some of the more traditional interpretations around him. Simon Keenlyside’s Count acts everyone else off the stage, and can still sing most people off it, too. To hear two such baritones in this opera is luxury indeed. But this will be remembered as the gender-fluid revival with a male Cherubino, the Korean-American countertenor Kangmin Justin Kim, who pulls it off in more senses than one.Joélle Harvey has the ideal warmth of voice for Susanna. But the full dramatic range of the woman who turns the tables on the men, and on whose music Mozart lavished such special attention, is not there yet. Her Deh Vieni was a very beautiful piece of singing, but it did not shake the soul as this aria can. Julia Kleiter’s Countess was likewise vocally distinguished but dramatically somewhat two-dimensional. It was left to the now veteran Diana Montague as Marcellina to bring the female cause to theatrical life, and it is a pity that, as usual, she is denied her final-act aria to underline the point."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0b4b3aaf78e74e95f81d05cbc4c8acd500630da/0_0_4244_2825/master/4244.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32b042b43657ddefa9332fe4bdc016ed 1010w","title":"a sneaker peek behind the scenes at new balance","story":"Since 1982, New Balance has produced its flagship 990s at one of two US factories. We take a look at the craftsmanship that goes into each trainer at the site in MassachusettsFew trainers can claim a fanbase as erse as that of the New Balance 990 series. The first trainer to cost $100 when it was released in 1982, it was a performance running shoe that was eventually embraced for its nerdy dad look (the late Steve Jobs was a fan), while also acquiring street cred in Baltimore and DC. Meanwhile, the 990v4, which was released in 2016, popped up at fashion shows while being name checked by rappers such as Meek Mill and Lil Yachty.Each pair of 990v5s takes three hours to make they’re constructed from more than 30 different components and are handled by more than 30 workers. Tejada is the leader of the “closing” team, which puts the final touches on the shoe – hand-sewing the leather and suede in the heel. She’s been sewing at New Balance for 31 years, and first put needle to thread when she was a nine-year-old girl under the watchful eye of her mother, who was a seamstress in the Dominican Republic, where Tejada grew up.“I have sewn all my life. This is my pride,” she says. “When I’m sewing, I am happy – I am doing what I learned, with high quality. No run-off. Clean lines, everything where it needs to be.”Eric Vassall, the senior product manager at New Balance in charge of the 990 series, believes the craftsmanship and experience that workers such as Tejada bring to bear is part of what has made the shoe appeal to so many distinct markets.“I’ve been here 19 years and you see generation after generation after generation. So you have the mother who has been here that taught the daughter, who had taught the son,” he says.And at New Balance, the workers don’t just make the shoes – they are also integrated into the design process. This is only possible because, unlike most of its competitors, New Balance both manufactures and designs the bulk of its trainers in the same offices. This means that instead of emails going back and forth across different time zones, workers can give designers and engineers direct feedback in person.For Vassall, the fact that his team only works a few floors above the production line has been crucial. It allows them to make quick adjustments and, ultimately, produce a better product.“I would say for the latest version of the 990, the 990v5, we always would come downstairs and talk to the craftspeople and say: ‘Hey, what’s working, what’s not working?’”Jesse Plouffe, the product developer who worked on the 990v5, says workers like Tejada have made him better at his job.“They’re experts. I can’t tell them how to stitch the shoe. I have no idea how to stitch it. I know what I want to do, but they are experts and the value they add is incredible,” he says.And the atmosphere on the line embodies that spirit of collaboration. The workers move quickly – they each have just 22.5 seconds to complete their task – but still find moments to greet each other warmly.Luis Puello, a 51-year-old leather cutter, carefully runs his hands across a sheet of pig’s hide, looking for defects that he marks with a laser before a machine makes a cut. Over the years, he says, he has developed a better feel for the leather, quickly sensing which parts will function best in different areas of the shoe.He smiles when asked what he thinks about the 990s that he helps make every day. “When the job is done, you see what you’ve done, and you feel proud,” he says.New Balance’s 990v5s are available at the New Balance London flagship store or newbalance"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9f45684fe0c7e6059205f7ddf3ea7c1e135e8f8/178_0_2946_1768/master/2946.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8a15068097899985302b1c2493ae409","title":"brexit party meps turn their backs european anthem ode to joy","story":"Nigel Farage faces wall with party members for European anthem on opening dayNigel Farage and his Brexit party MEPs turned their backs during the playing of the European anthem at a ceremony to mark the opening of the European parliament.As a saxophone quartet and opera singer performed Beethoven’s Ode to Joy in the Strasbourg chamber on the first day of the new parliament, the 29 Brexit party MEPs turned away from the group to face the back wall.Labour’s leader in the European parliament, Richard Corbett, later described the move as pathetic.More than three months after Britain was scheduled to leave the EU, 73 British MEPs have arrived in Strasbourg to take up a mandate that is due to expire on 31 October, the new deadline.The Brexit party’s 29 MEPs marked their arrival in Strasbourg, with a photo underneath the 28 national flags outside the Strasbourg parliament. A few wore turquoise ties, the colour of the party intended to mark the difference with Ukip purple, Farage’s old party.Farage, who has been an MEP since 1999, said Brexit party MEPs would stay beyond 31 October “if we have to stay longer” and delivered a carefully-crafted message to the two Conservatives battling to become prime minister, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt.“Now we have two contenders telling us whatever happens, come hell or high water we are leaving on the 31 October,” he said. “I don’t believe a word they say but I will give them this warning: if they don’t deliver Brexit on that date they are toast and then we will then see a turquoise takeover.”His new MEPs cheered as Farage claimed the Brexit party was the biggest in Europe. While the 29 Brexit MEPs are the joint largest party in the European parliament (along with Germany’s CDU-CSU alliance), Farage has been unable to forge a pan-European group, meaning he will no longer have a prime-time speaking slot in European parliament debates.Massing on the other side of the parliament, the Liberal Democrats also trumpeted their arrival by walking into the chamber together wearing yellow T-shirts emblazoned with their campaign slogan Bollocks to Brexit. The party has a record 16 MEPs, while Labour and the Conservatives have been reduced to all-time lows.Chris Davies, re-elected for the Liberal Democrats after losing his seat in 2014, said he expected to serve out his full five-year term. “Of course I do. If Brexit isn’t delivered by 31 October I don’t think it will happen. There is no majority in the country there is no majority in the House of Commons.”The MEP denied the crude slogan was unparliamentary. He said that, when he met MEP colleagues who told him he would only stay a few months, “I say no. ‘I am here for five years. Bollocks to Brexit.’ And I get the same reaction every time: a big smile. It’s amazing how well Bollocks to Brexit translates into 24 different languages.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2d5b5bc385dd88e02d55f1facd504b17a1c7824/0_254_3079_1848/master/3079.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f599f804bb69db73a6c47057fae57a3","title":"heseltine urges greater powers for englands metro mayors","story":"Tory peer backs giving control of failing schools, housing and local taxes to regional leadersEngland’s metro mayors must be given far more power, according to Michael Heseltine, more than 30 years after he first called for English devolution.Heseltine, a former Conservative deputy prime minister, has called on the government to put regional leaders in charge of school performance and housing, and to give them the ability to levy taxes, in a review commissioned to assess their role.Heseltine, who served as a minister under both Margaret Thatcher and John Major, listed 20 proposals which would give the elected mayors the ability to transform their regions and narrow the gap with London.Lord Heseltine drew up proposals in 2012 in his report called No Stone Unturned, which set out to create combined authorities and metro mayors.But in a new report launched in Birmingham he warned that progress had stalled, partly because the government had been “paralysed by indecision” as the “shadow of Brexit hangs like the darkest storm cloud over our body politic”.The report, Empowering English Cities, commissioned by West Midlands Combined Authority, is expected to guide the next prime minister in reducing the economic gap between London and the regions.It suggests that mayors should be given responsibility for overseeing failing schools and affordable housing, and should also be able to control locally raised taxes.Heseltine said many of the current mayors were working “with one arm tied behind their backs” due to the imbalance of power.For the report Heseltine interviewed the mayors of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, Greater Manchester, Liverpool city region, Tees Valley, West of England and the West Midlands, all elected in 2017.“London is too powerful and takes too many of the everyday decisions,” he writes.“If you live 200 miles away from the people who decide your future, you become frustrated, lack hope and ultimately become apathetic.“Too few of the men and women who devise the policies that shape your early years, your adolescence, your education, your life chances, your whole life, have never experienced your life.”The West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, urged Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson to listen to the findings.He said: “With the inertia created by Brexit, key policy decisions such as the future direction of devolution are at risk of falling by the wayside and I hope this document, and its bold vision, encourages not only similar ambitious thought but real action.”He added: “Against the backdrop of the leadership election, here is an idea whose time has come.“As our potential PMs look around for fertile areas of growth, they must conclude that our city regions offer huge opportunities, if allowed to unleash their potential.“Devolution is an idea that has been shown enough light to take root, but now needs wholesale embracing to flourish.” mayors currently have some say over transport, planning and economic development but each devolution deal is different.Steve Rotheram, metro mayor of the Liverpool city region, said: “While Westminster has been log-jammed dealing with Brexit, we have been proving that we can get things done. The whole point of devolution is that at a local level we are able to make decisions about our future better than Whitehall mandarins who know nothing of our specific, local circumstances. But the government has gone cold on further devolution, so whoever becomes PM needs to commit to devolving further powers and resource so that areas can shape their own destinies.“As this report concludes, we must have real devolution, with further powers and funding devolved to city regions like ours.“Only then will we see the inequality and injustice that has grown up over generations reduce and see our country fulfil its true potential.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d91e1c25b8a532049bb3a0e7f9d62a5bbf1a0cb/682_43_1197_718/master/1197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c388c2d9dc3f0fd12e21e922125298e5","title":"no 10 confirms inquiry into leak claims about jeremy corbyns health labour civil service","story":"Labour leader had called for an independent investigation into civil service sourceDowning Street has confirmed the Cabinet Office is investigating the source of a leak speculating about Jeremy Corbyn’s health, and that it will take disciplinary action against any iniduals found responsible.The Labour leader had written to the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, to demand an investigation, after a story appeared in the Times on Saturday. It cited anonymous civil servants saying that Corbyn seemed to lack a firm grasp of issues and was being “propped up” by his advisers.Theresa May’s official spokesman said: “It would clearly be inappropriate and unacceptable for comments of this sort to have been made or briefed to the press.“The Cabinet Office is investigating this potential breach of the civil service code fully, just as it would any other. If we are able to identify any inidual responsible, we will take disciplinary action.”Asked whether the civil service would carry out the investigation, he said: “We are taking the matter extremely seriously. The civil service is responsible for looking into any potential breaches of the civil service code, and this is no different.”Labour strongly suspects Sedwill is responsible for the leak, or at least had knowledge of it, and is concerned that he would have a key role in preparing Whitehall for a potential change of government at the next general election.One senior party figure said there was a lack of trust in the cabinet secretary, who was hand-picked by May.For that reason, the government’s announcement of an internal inquiry is unlikely to satisfy Corbyn.He wrote to Sedwill on Tuesday, demanding reassurances about the “scope and independence” of the inquiry, and calling for a “speedy and thorough independent investigation, rather than one carried out by the Cabinet Office”.The shadow Cabinet Office minister, Jon Trickett, raised the leak in parliament on Monday, saying: “I’m standing next to the leader of the opposition, whose fitness I must say is legendary.”Labour has seized on the leak, claiming it is evidence that a powerful political establishment would try to resist the radical reforms a Corbyn-led government might carry out.Corbyn tweeted on Monday:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f14672994140f49adbe087c6f43f2ff8b95fcc3c/0_327_4903_2942/master/4903.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0642288858c3dd116694b5ea80ed5c7b","title":"climate change european heatwave likelier","story":"Searing heat shows crisis is ‘here and now’, say scientists, and worse than predictedThe record-breaking heatwave that struck France and other European nations in June was made at least five – and possibly 100 – times more likely by the climate crisis, scientists have calculated.Such heatwaves are also about 4C hotter than a century ago, the researchers say. Furthermore, the heatwaves hitting Europe are more frequent and more severe than climate models have predicted.Last month was the hottest June since 1880, both in Europe and around the world, according to separate data released on Tuesday by the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. In Europe thetemperature was 3C above the June average a century ago, and globally it was more than 1C higher.The European heatwave broke temperature records at many locations in France, Switzerland, Austria, Germany and Spain. In France it was broken by more than 1.5C on 28 June, with 45.9C recorded near the city of Nîmes.The searing heat led to wildfires in Spain and Germany, and widespread disruption across the continent. It is inevitable that the heatwave will have caused many premature deaths, particularly as it occurred outside the usual holiday months when people are more able to take shelter. But these figures take time to compile. The heatwave of 2003 caused more than 70,000 premature deaths across Europe.Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.\u0026nbspHotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was made at least 50 times more likely by global heating, linking it directly to climate change.Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.\u0026nbspAnother important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.\u0026nbspMost of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique in March and April. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage.Dr Friederike Otto, of the University of Oxford, one of the scientists behind the new analysis, said: “This is a strong reminder again that climate change is happening here and now. It is not a problem for our kids only.”Global heating caused by the carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels and other human activities means heatwaves are becoming more probable and severe, a key part of the climate crisis. “Attribution” studies such as the new analysis estimate how much more likely and severe they are. The unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”, a separate study published in June found.The latest analysis examined the hottest three-day period of last month’s heatwave in France – 26 to 28 June. The scientists used average daily temperatures, as these are a better indicator of the effects on health than maximum or minimum temperatures. The average across those three days and nights was 27.5C. The researchers, many of whom happened to be at a conference on extreme events and climate change in Toulouse, then used temperature records stretching back to 1901 to assess the probability of a heatwave last month and in the past. They also examined climate change models to assess the impact of global heating.Global heating caused by human activities made the French heatwave at least five times more likely, said Otto, based on combining the observations and climate models. Analysis of the observations alone indicated the heatwave was at least 10 times more likely than a century ago, and potentially 100 times.However, these bigger increases in probability may result in part from changes in land use, soil moisture and irrigation, the growth of towns and cities, and air pollution, all of which can affect temperature.Nick Watts, the executive director of the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change, said heatwaves affected elderly people and those with pre-existing conditions most.“The effects will be felt in the form of exacerbated heart disease and heat-related illness, spikes in hospital admissions and premature death, and increased pressure on health services,” he said. “It is clear that health services and local authorities require increased funding if they are to meet the rising threat of climate change to health.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4e303285161fad0c3d4a7c3e924e751667741b/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=021fb721b2212a5b5aea6275acb0e8aa","title":"tell us has your camhs record affected future employment","story":"As part of an investigation into the issues people who have completed treatment face we would like to hear your experiences Hundreds of thousands of young people pass through the UK’s Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) each year.

Beat New Zealand in Chester-le-Street on Wednesday and Eoin Morgan’s side has secured a semi‑final berth, which was regarded as the minimum requirement for England at the outset. Lose and they can be overtaken in the table. A tie would probably be enough – if that becomes an option come Wednesday evening then nobody will be leaving early.It will be another tense occasion, though quieter than the match against India at Edgbaston. The stakes are the same, however, even if the opposition offers a contrasting challenge and a smaller number of supporters. Ostensibly New Zealand are not as strong as India but they have often had the measure of England in ICC tournaments. England have not beaten New Zealand in the World Cup since 1983, a worrying statistic, which incorporates five consecutive defeats.Mathematically New Zealand are also not guaranteed to qualify. So their approach could be clouded by concerns about not damaging their net run rate. No such complications apply to England. They have to win (or tie). As expected Kane Williamson, their captain, has been vital to New Zealand’s lofty position in the table. He is their highest runscorer and, more surprisingly, their most economical bowler after propelling 15 overs. Moreover behind his bushy beard he calmly makes the decisions out in the middle.Williamson provides the ballast in a batting line-up that has spluttered its way through the tournament. He has hit 454 runs so far his lowest score is 40 his strike rate is a modest 77 but that merely highlights the fact that he makes sure that he stays in while hoping that someone will provide a few sparks at the other end. Until now Jimmy Neesham, the veteran Ross Taylor and Colin de Grandhomme have been his likeliest allies. Martin Guptill, who has tormented England in the past, has not really fired yet.Williamson has seldom been short of options in the field. Trent Boult has become his senior paceman partly because Tim Southee began the tournament injured and since then has been on the sidelines because of the excellence of the others. It is just conceivable that the vastly experienced Southee could make a late, telling appearance in the competition.The most eye-popping contributions have come from Lockie Ferguson, who always looks as if he has just arrived at the ground in a Spitfire with his moustache and his straight back. He has 17 wickets in the tournament and has bowled fast from wide of the crease. Based on his performances here it seems odd that this 28-year-old has never played a Test match, but that might be on the horizon. For the moment he is Williamson’s ace. Witness his dismissal of David Warner at Lord’s when searing bounce found the edge of the bat. Expect him to have an early bowl at Eoin Morgan at Chester-le Street. He will offer few opportunities for England’s captain to demonstrate his cover drive.Neesham has also bowled well for Williamson the military mediums of de Grandhomme can be handy and there is the option of two spinners in the shape of the all-rounder, Mitchell Santner, and the leg-spinner, Ish Sodhi. The playing surface at Chester-le-Street is one of the largest in the country so two spinners could be accommodated by both sides Morgan’s preference for one at Edgbaston last Sunday, where there was a short square boundary, looked very good in hindsight.Both sides will be pondering the best balance of their attack. There is a case for recalling Moeen Ali though that is not certain, since this might well mean omitting Mark Wood, who has impressed throughout the tournament. After his performance at Edgbaston it is hard to imagine Morgan leaving out Liam Plunkett. Morgan is not a superstitious man but it may not have escaped his notice that in the three games England have lost, Plunkett has been on the sidelines. Moreover despite the “freedom to express” mantra of the team the England hierarchy probably did not appreciate Moeen’s dismissal in that defeat at Headingley to Sri Lanka when his pursuit of a second consecutive six was unsuccessful.I have no inside knowledge of the state of Jason Roy’s right hand but my expectation is that he will play against New Zealand. Roy was unable to field at Edgbaston - nothing to do with his dodgy hamstring, you understand – because of receiving a blow to his hand when batting. Despite that impediment Roy batted brilliantly against India. If he stays in for an hour he frightens opponents and somehow Jonny Bairstow, who was also wonderfully fearless in that innings, seems more comfortable with Roy alongside him.Despite smashing 148 against Afghanistan Morgan’s batting is a source of some concern especially against the pacemen. He has enough in his in-tray not to worry too much about that just now and his contribution as captain is very significant, if hard to measure numerically. There is, however, a cricketing argument to shuffle the order if England lose early wickets. Technically Ben Stokes is much better equipped to stay in against new, bouncy balls than Morgan. But for all the talk of flexibility it would be a surprise if they made that change the all-too-easy, though unjustified, charge would be that the England captain is hiding.If Morgan oversees victory at Chester-le-Street any such issue will be a pinprick. England would then be contemplating their first World Cup semi-final for 27 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bd913c1112f193144bc27854fdc5a6580229a8b/0_102_4432_2660/master/4432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8763d0367d1871fa9068c892d012e981","title":"bangladesh v india cricket world cup 2019 live","story":"It doesn’t even get that far, as it’s impossible to decide with any certainty that the ball didn’t hit the bat, or, if it did so, whether it hit the pad first. It all seemed to happen at the same time, and given the on-field decision I can’t see how it could have happened any differently. Kohli is miffed about it, but for what it’s worth ball tracking wouldn’t have overruled the umpire’s call.The umpire, however, doesn’t. It looked to me like it was probably missing leg stump.11th over: Bangladesh 47-1 (Soumya 17, Shakib 6) Bumrah’s back, presumably in the belief that cheaply dismissing Shakib Al Hasan would snap Bangladesh’s spirit like a brittle twig. Instead Shakib drives down the ground for four, nicely timed.10th over: Bangladesh 40-0 (Soumya 16, Shakib 1) Tamim raced out of the blocks, scored 15 from his first 12 deliveries with three excellent boundaries, then his form suddenly departed and he got seven off his next 17 balls, with no boundaries.Tamim tries to push a rising ball down to third man but he’s late to it, and it flicks off the toe of the bat and into the stumps!9th over: Bangladesh 38-0 (Tamim 22, Soumya 15) Bhuvi Kumar continues, and four singles are taken. This is a decent start from Bangladesh, but they require something a bit more than decent.8th over: Bangladesh 34-0 (Tamim 20, Soumya 13) Mohammad Shami replaces Bumrah, and Soumya Sakar gets his first boundary, lifting over point for four. Meanwhile in Leicester, England are struggling against both Australia and the umpires:7th over: Bangladesh 28-0 (Tamim 20, Soumya 7) Tamim, timing still Awol, slogs the ball skyward towards deep midwicket, where it lands safely.6th over: Bangladesh 24-0 (Tamim 16, Soumya 7) They take a sharp single to short third man, where Pandya fields and takes a shy at the stumps. He misses, though, and with nobody backing up it rockets away to the rope and they end up with five. Bumrah’s penultimate delivery is clocked at 93mph his last is a steepling bouncer that Dhoni does well to get a glovetip to, saving a few runs in the process. Six off the over: a single, four overthrows and a bye.5th over: Bangladesh 18-0 (Tamim 16, Soumya 2) Tamim’s timing vanishes as Bhuvi takes aims at leg stump, and after some awkward squirming they scamper a couple of singles off the last couple of deliveries.4th over: Bangladesh 16-0 (Tamim 15, Soumya 1) Phwoar! Bumrah’s delivery heads towards leg stump, straightens off the seam, whips past the bat and bounces just over off. A maiden, and a very uncomfortable one for the batsman.3rd over: Bangladesh 16-0 (Tamim 15, Soumya 1) Tamim is looking in fabulous nick already, now driving imperiously through the covers. Soumya, by contrast, is feeling his way into proceedings.2nd over: Bangladesh 9-0 (Tamim 9, Soumya 0) Tamim pings the ball off his pads and through midwicket for four, fabulously timed. Then Bumrah’s last delivery, a bit too wide of off stump, is speared through the covers.1st over: Bangladesh 1-0 (Tamim 1, Soumya 0) Bhuvi Kumar bowls, and after two dots Tamim Iqbal waves his bat at a delivery that starts wide and moves wider, an ugly shot that misses the ball by a distance. A single later Soumya’s at it as well, after the ball jags wildly off the seam, and then the last heads the other way, into the batsman who reacts well to fend it away.The players are already back out, and ready to rock. Thanks Daniel. Afternoonmorningwhatever everyone. Well this might be fun. At one stage it looked like Bangladesh would have had a lot more than 315 runs to aim at, though they have only scored 300+ to win ODIs four times in their history (most recently against West Indies a couple of weeks back). This might just be doable, if they get off to a good start and assuming India’s late-innings slow-down was entirely down to Bangladesh’s excellence and not the pitch suddenly mutating into something awkward.I suppose the most likely outcome here is India by 60 or so, but there’s plenty of scope for something way, way better than that. Bangladesh will miss Mamudullah (and yours) - they’ll probably need something serious from Tamim, who owes them one, and Shakib – but both are eminently capable. Simon Burnton will coax you through all of that - you can email him here or tweet @Simon_Burnton.For a long time, that looked like being a lot more – Rohit Sharma is decent at ODIs – and Bangladesh will fancy they’ve a chance in the chase. India are warm favourites, especially with the pitch slowing up, but Bangladesh have some serious firepower, if they can avoid losing wickets in the opening powerplay. Shami does all he can to manufacture a hoik to leg from a ball outside off, but contrives to shovel onto his stumps instead. That’s fifer for Mustafizur, who bowled a superb final over. They run on a wide and Mushfiqur chucks to Mustafizur, who removes the bails. 50th over: India 315-7 (Kumar 3, Shami 1) Bhuvi forces a single to midwicket, then Shami drags from outside off to wide long on. Then a wide, and they try to steal and extra run...Dhoni goes again, unloading the years at a bouncer, but it’s on him too quickly and he slams it into the air, cross-batted Shakib catches easily, behind the stumps at the non-striker’s. 50th over: India 311-6 (Dhoni 35, Kumar 1) Mustafizur charges in and Dhoni flays him to long off, but there’s a man out Dhoni refuses the single because he’s Dhoni. Next, he cracks to the man at mid on...49th over: India 311-6 (Dhoni 35, Kumar 1) Dhoni drives two to cover and they run two, then he absolutely zetzes four through extra cover, down on one knee like back in the day. Two dots follows, then he hops back, waits, and clouts four more - through extra cover again. “Dhoni, Dhoni, Dhoni!” chant the crowd, even though their hero is wearing a tank top. I guess we can abandon the OBO’s sartorial code when it comes to his ilk. 48th over: India 300-6 (Dhoni 24, Kumar 1) Bhuvi gets off the mark immediately, nudging into the off side for one, then Dhoni adds another. This has been a really great comeback from Bangladesh, who were in danger of chasing a monster but are now looking at something manageable. “I think the point is that by virtue of being level on points both teams have had the same chance against the same opposition and ended up with the same points,” says Geoff Saunders. “So head to head must be a better indicator of the better side to go forward. If not, you get a situation where one team goes to the next stage by virtue of hitting more runs against poor opposition but the team that beat them is left out. How would you feel if you had beaten that team yet they go through?”Yes, I agree with this. Mathematics should not be a prominent feature of things.A well-disguised slower-ball bouncer has Karthik piling through the shot way too soon and spooning a catch to mid on. 47th over: India 297-5 (Dhoni 22, Karthik 8) Shaifuddin returns, and Karthik could do with doing something, being picked for roughly this eventuality. And he does, shaping to drive then opening the face to smack a square drive through point for four. Three singles before, then two after, make this a reasonable over, nine coming from it, but I’m not sure why India aren’t swinging for the fences. Bhuvi can bat, so they’ve got at least one more wicket to risk losing. 46th over: India 288-5 (Dhoni 19, Karthik 2) Is Dhoni going? He takes a tiny step then allows the ball across body and bat, glancing to the fence for four. A single follows, but the fielder shies, hits, and concedes an overthrow., then three more singles arrive. “Have you seen the number of times that Rohit Sharma gets out immediately after getting his hundred,” tweets Krish. “Show me a more selfish , personal glory driven cricketer than him. And Bangladesh has all chances now to wrap up this game.”I don’t think it’s a selfish thing, just that those of us who’ve played the game know that mentally it’s hard to refocus after reaching a milestone. Better to make 100 and something than 20 something - my guess is his team-mates are quite happy with his work so far. 45th over: India 279-5 (Dhoni 11, Karthik 1) India need something from Dhoni here, but it’s Karthik on strike and he’s off the mark right away, turning to midwicket. Dhoni has to content himself with a single too, then an absolute jaffa grips and spins past Karthik’s outside edge. The last delivery is a dot, and Shakib finishes with 1-41 from his 10, yet another dazzling effort. A heave takes the ball from outside off to deep square, but it’s not out of the middle and picks out the man, who botches it ... only to take the rebound off his own shoulder. Bangladesh are bang in this! 44th over: India 277-4 (Pant 48, Dhoni 10) Rubel returns and strays to leg - though Mushfiqur should stop it - ceding four leg byes. Dhoni’s found it tricky against the spinners so might fancy a dart here, but it takes until the fourth ball of the over for Pant to work a single ... but it doesn’t matter, its final delivery pulled hard to deep square for four. The women’s Ashes are about to get underway - be following them here. 43rd over: India 268-4 (Pant 47, Dhoni 6) Shakib has bowled pretty well here - he’s 0-39 off nine - and the three added to his tally from this over, he’d’ve took, as Ryan Giggs would say. 42nd over: India 265-4 (Pant 44, Dhoni 6) And there he goes! Mustafizur tries a full one and Pant bends the knee to curl a pull around his front foot, sending a one-bounce four to deep square. Pant is a serious talent!A wide follows, then a single, before Dhoni times three through midwicket. Pant responds with a single, and that’s 10 off the over. “After that wicket of Pandya, India’s progress depends on three wicket-keepers,” says Mahindra Killedar. “Not sure how many times that has happened before!!”The aim is to have a team of them, like England and flighty batsmen.40th over: India 251-4 (Pant 36, Dhoni 1) Have a look! Pant does not wait to be asked! After defending Saifuddin’s first ball, he creams him through cover for four then whacks through midwicket for four then rousts through point for four! Two singles follow, and that’s 14 from the over. “One theoretical consideration against head-to-head as a tournament classifier”, tweets Rory Bowden, “is that, if two teams are tied on overall results, then head-to-head and each team’s performance against all other teams necessarily give opposing results.”Sure, but the points are level. Head-to-head has got to be worth more than who smashed the worst team by the more, or lost to the best team by the least.39th over: India 237-4 (Pant 23, Dhoni 0) A double-wicket maiden from Mustafizur, and the key over of the match so far. Bangladesh won’t mind even 10 an over from here.

She’s made some audacious hundreds but she’ll have to do so on her own if England are to post a competitive total.The partnership had just gone past 50, and it’s broken. A ball that wasn’t that short, but Brunt went back and tried to pull. it jagged back in and hit her on the back thigh right in front of middle. That’s stone, I’m afraid. Brunt battled through, made 20 from 49, and did her best. But the top-order collapse means her team is still in a parlous position. And Anya Shrubsole batting at No8 feels very high in the order.26th over: England 96-5 (Sciver 39, Brunt 20) Double change, and Ash Gardner’s off-breaks will be the new entrant to the bowling book. She gets a couple driving back to her, which shows she’s landing them well. But when Sciver advances to turn a ball into a high full toss, she checks her shot and deflects it cleverly out through cover for a couple, following from another brace that she drove. 25th over: England 91-5 (Sciver 34, Brunt 20) Delissa Kimmince comes on. Seam-up, strong-shouldered, the safe-pair-of-hands type of all-rounder who is so useful in the 20-over format. Only played a dozen ODIs before today though. She’s back of a length mostly, picked off for a couple of singles, then Brunt gets a faint edge on a leg-side ball for four as Kimmince strays. This partnership heading towards 50 now, and vital for England.24th over: England 84-5 (Sciver 32, Brunt 15) Edged and four! That’s extra pace for you. Sciver flirts with the ball outside off and draws a genuine nick, just past the ing Healy. It skipped away for four. 23rd over: England 77-5 (Sciver 26, Brunt 14) Wareham follows up to Sciver, who bolts a single and draws a direct hit at the non-striker’s end. But she’s home. A couple more singles follow.22nd over: England 74-5 (Sciver 24, Brunt 13) Enough spin, Lanning wants a wicket. Perry comes back and immediately is up in an appeal for lbw. I’ll tell you what, Martin Saggers is never going to give another leg-before decision for the rest of his career. That gun is welded into the holster after his last misadventure. Brunt doesn’t mind, gallops down the track next ball and clobbers Perry over midwicket. Brunt has a particular personal friction with her fast-bowling counterpart. 21st over: England 68-5 (Sciver 23, Brunt 8) England really putting the foot down now, with four from the over. Slow down! Wareham gives them too much width and Sciver is able to dust off the cut shot a couple of times. 20th over: England 64-5 (Sciver 20, Brunt 7) Getting a bit more adventurous against Jonassen, is brunt. Skips down the pitch to drive back to the bowler on the bounce, then down again to cut a ball hard but straight to the field. Jonassen gives one more air and Brunt can’t unlock its secrets. Then finally she gets one away to deep backward point. Sciver taps and runs one to cover.19th over: England 62-5 (Sciver 19, Brunt 6) Wareham has strayed onto leg stump too many times today, but it’s only costing her singles as they can’t afford to attack her. What a luxury for a leg-spinner. Four overs for 13 runs.18th over: England 60-5 (Sciver 18, Brunt 5) Sciver again forcing the pace, bolting back for a second run after clipping Jonassen to deep square, then cutting a single and dashing for one. That’s what they need, to make the most of every chance to score. 17th over: England 57-5 (Sciver 15, Brunt 5) How many times would Katherine Brunt have been 4 off 20 balls? She loves a clout. But Wareham keeps floating the ball up at her pads, a threatening line in these circumstances. Finally Brunt gets one leg-side enough that she can bunt a single. Then they get a little busier, with a brace and a single from Sciver. 16th over: England 53-5 (Sciver 12, Brunt 4) The main thing for England though is not losing any more wickets. Even if they go at 1 run per over for the next 20, that would be vastly preferable than hitting out and getting bowled out in a rush. A single from Jonassen’s over, and it’s time for drinks.15th over: England 52-5 (Sciver 12, Brunt 3) England becalmed. Wareham to Brunt, and bowls a gorgeous over. Beats the top edge with an over-spinner that bounces, gives a lot of loop to balls that dip on the bat. Brunt looks all at sea, finally stabbing a single off the last ball.14th over: England 51-5 (Sciver 12, Brunt 2) The spinners racing through the overs here, apologies for the brief posts. A single for Brunt from Jonassen is all they’ll get.13th over: England 50-5 (Sciver 12, Brunt 1) Georgia Wareham the leg-spinner comes on, and bowls tidily enough aside from a ball that Sciver punches over cover for four. A single to Brunt raises England’s 50. Their 100 looks a long way off.12th over: England 44-5 (Sciver 7, Brunt 0) Another wicket maiden. Katherine Brunt to the crease with a fire to fight. Mercy. (Invoke the rule?) Wilson has looked the most assured, but a change to spin brings her undone. Jess Jonassen, left-arm crafty, hits the stumps every ball she bowls. Sciver taps away one on leg stump for a single, then Wilson goes down to sweep but misses, kneeling in front of off. But hang on... did that hit her on the thigh or the glove? Wilson didn’t show much obvious dissent that I could see, aside from looking disappointed, but hasn’t she gloved that? Here comes the replay, and, yes, she’s absolutely punched that away to square leg trying to sweep. It hasn’t even hit her pad! It’s gone from the glove into the ground. The umpire at square leg could have seen that. That is, flat out, one of the worst umpiring errors I think I’ve seen. 11th over: England 44-4 (Sciver 7, Wilson 15) Schutt, pitching up and looking for something. Nearly gets it with a ball that beats the edge. Draws the drive from Wilson twice more, stopped each time, before an eventual single squeezed away is the only run from the over. 10th over: England 43-4 (Sciver 7, Wilson 14) England lucky they picked Fran Wilson today. She nails a drive through cover, then slashes Perry high off the top edge over backward point for another four. Perry oversteps with a fuller ball, then Wilson steps back for an almighty hoick off the free hit, soaring way up in the air before dropping next to Lanning behind point. A dozen runs from the over, and England salvage something from the first Powerplay. If you ignore the four wickets down, that is.9th over: England 31-4 (Sciver 5, Wilson 5) Nat Sciver gets a fair working over now. A ball that zips past the outside edge. A drive struck well but straight at cover. Then a ball that cuts back in and takes her high on the thigh pad, drawing a shout from Schutt, but Sciver is preoccupied with the ball rolling back from the collision and just missing her off stump. Sciver goes right back into defensive mode, and plays out another maiden. 8th over: England 31-4 (Sciver 5, Wilson 5) Could any linguists out there confirm my suspicion that Vlaeminck would be the antecedent of the name Fleming? Probably deriving from... Flemish, chances are. Perry bowls a maiden that has Wilson defending half the over before nicking one on the bounce to Healy behind the stumps. 7th over: England 31-4 (Sciver 5, Wilson 5) So after a couple of overs of Fast \u0026amp The Furious level swerve, Schutt loses it completely with a wide outside off then a wide down leg. Then a long-hop that Sciver thwacks for four. 6th over: England 25-4 (Sciver 1, Wilson 5) On the Tuffers \u0026amp Vaughan show on BBC radio this week, Tammy Beaumont was bemoaning the fact they wouldn’t be able to watch the England women’s team in the football tonight. At this rate...Fran Wilson comes in, having surged into the side on the back of recent good form. She’ll need every shred of it. She blocks out Perry’s hat-trick ball, works a single, gets the strike back and then slashes a cut for four. That’s more like it. Cue up the Freddie Mercury! Another one bites the dust. Perry bowls a pretty straightforward ball, maybe cutting in a touch off the seam. Knight is camped on the back foot trying to work it to square leg, and... misses. That’s all. Hit on the knee roll in front of middle, and she’s not tall enough for that to mean it’s going over. Four down, three without the score moving. 5th over: England 19-3 (Knight 0, Sciver 0) Jeepers creepers. It’s a wicket maiden for Schutt, and a vicious start from the Australians by now. What on earth was that from Sarah Taylor? Schutt bowls a beauty, hooping in again, but Taylor was nowhere near it. Surely she’s seen from the other end how much the ball is moving. But she tries to play a big airy drive through midwicket, across the line of the ball, which swings far enough to beat her inside edge and knock over her stumps. England in all sorts.4th over: England 19-2 (Taylor 1) Bowled from the last ball! Beaumont had finally got motoring in this over, smacking the first ball through cover for four, then cutting the fifth ball savagely as Perry gave her width. But a similar delivery brings Beaumont’s undoing, cutting off the bottom edge and onto the stumps. That hurts.3rd over: England 9-1 (Beaumont 7, Taylor 0) Schutt is still hooping the ball in the way she does, and Beaumont is equal to it for a single, but Taylor is taking things very carefully to begin with, seeing out the rest of the over.2nd over: England 8-1 (Beaumont 6, Taylor 0) Just two singles and the wicket from Perry’s first over, and if there’s one thing you don’t want to donate to Perry, it’s an easy entree to the series. Oh, that’s a soft start. Ellyse Perry has been in good nick with the new ball for a fair while, and she gets a gift very early. Beaumont takes a single first ball of the over, then Jones sees a shortish ball and tries to pull, but it’s only waist high and she doesn’t get in the right position to play it. A looping top edge pops up for an easy catch for Healy trotting towards square leg.1st over: England 6-0 (Beaumont 4, Jones 0) Lovely start for Beaumont! Schutt swings the ball wildly into her pads, but Beaumont was waiting for the inswing and drove the full length away through mid-on for four. That’s the only scoring shot off the bat though, with a leg bye and a wide adding to the score as Schutt doesn’t give anything to swing through.If you’ee puzzled by that last reference and need an introduction, find a record called As Heard on Radio Soulwax. A giant of the mash-up genre.We’re getting what can only be described as an extremely rousing rendition of Jerusalem, my favourite song about artichokes, from a local soprano whose name I have unfortunately missed, my apologies. She finishes with an enormous flourish, backed by what is either an invisible choir and brass band, or a backing tape. The PA then gives way to Run the World by Beyoncé. Classic mash-up, that must have been a 2 Many DJs jam. Vlaeminck, Villani and Nicola Carey are the three of Australia’s 14 who miss out. Wyatt, Winfield and Gunn miss for England. Omitting Danni Wyatt for Fran Wilson is a big call, though her best format is T20.If you’re wondering about pronunciation, Tayla Vlaeminck says her name goes Val-e-mick. So let me wrack my brains for the likely XIs in batting order...Electing to chase from the outset, Meg Lanning. Heather Knight says she would batted first anyway. So there. The teams are warming up out in front of us at the Leicester County Ground. The English women started with a round-ball football, the Australians with an oval Aussie Rules ball. By now they’ve reverted to actual cricket kit. The Australians are formidable, and the English are stewing. I also wrote a preview to fill you in on the details.Good... not morning. It’s afternoon in the UK. Most of our World Cup starts have been 10:30 am so it’s hard to adjust. But this is a different competition, a different set of teams, different parameters. This is the start of the Women’s Ashes series of 2019. Across the multi-format series we’ll start with three 50-over matches, then a Test match, then three T20s to close things out, with the final T20 coming the night before the men’s Ashes series starts at Edgbaston.

But this remarkable travelling show from Giffords Circus takes its title from Coleridge’s Kubla Khan and, like the poem, invokes a mood of dreamy ecstasy. Directed by Cal McCrystal (of One Man , Two Guvnors fame), it uses music and costume to evoke the psychedelic world of Hair and to suggest that everyone on honey-dew hath fed and drunk the milk of paradise. The catch is, of course, that the performers are no woozy hippies but formidable athletes.They also are not just expert soloists but part of a versatile ensemble. Michael Fletcher, the floral-suited compere, is joined as a singer by Lil Rice, whom we have earlier seen prodigiously whirling and twirling inside a hoop known as a cyr wheel. Jacob D’Eustachio, a juggler described as “the man with the flying balls”, and Anna Rastova, the daring lady on the trapeze, re-emerge in the big musical numbers. The same goes for the Hungarian Donnert family, who vault effortlessly on and off horses, and for the circus’s founder, Nell Gifford, who regally appears, sporting a white gown and chaplet, astride a handsome steed.But, although this is a circus with a summer-of-love theme, McCrystal injects it with the physical comedy he famously brought to One Man. There is a madcap clown, Tweedy, who, with his mischievous eyes and red quiff sprouting from a close-cropped skull, suggests an anarchic version of Shakespeare’s Puck. The running gag is that Tweedy is a fugitive chef escaping from the circus restaurant, but he also proves to be a pancake-catching acrobat and an adept unicyclist. The highlight, however, for slapstick addicts is the item where Tweedy is joined by the burly Mr Fips as they cover each other in viscous goo and spray the audience with water. This is a show where you go in sober and possibly end up sloshed. But the circus’s real achievement is to create a sense of communal joy currently rivalled only by the Nicholas Hytner production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38a2f564395ee038982eaaeb32e4f9b54c1ef2dc/0_347_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7c5b864517da39e0fef2846fa4f5786","title":"tiktok under investigation over child data use","story":"UK inquiry looking at whether video-sharing app breaches data protection lawThe video-sharing app TikTok is under investigation in the UK for how it handles the personal data of its young users, and whether it prioritises the safety of children on its social network.Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, told a parliamentary committee the investigation began in February, prompted by a multimillion-dollar fine from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for similar violations.“We are looking at the transparency tools for children,” Denham said on Tuesday. “We’re looking at the messaging system, which is completely open, we’re looking at the kind of videos that are collected and shared by children online. We do have an active investigation into TikTok right now, so watch this space.”As well as general concerns about how private data was collected, the commissioner said there were concerns about how the open messaging system allowed any adult to message any child.She said the company was potentially violating the general data protection regulation (GDPR) which “requires the company to provide different services and different protections for children”.Laws governing children\u0027s relationship with technology vary worldwide, and are rarely enforced. The de facto age for many online services is 13, set by the US Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act in 1998, which prevents sites from targeting children, or knowingly allowing children to provide information online without parental consent. The burden of garnering that consent and the low returns for building services for children has meant, however, that providers tended to turn a blind eye to under-13s on their sites, neither catering for them nor policing their presence.That said, tech aimed more explicitly at children has blossomed recently, and legislation that aims to protect children from potential harm has been passed. Schoolchildren in France are barred by law from using their phones in school.Such laws are countered by efforts on the part of companies such as Facebook and Google to attract new users while young. Facebook offers Messenger Kids, which lets children speak to contacts vetted by their parents, while Google’s YouTube has a Kids app that offers copious parental controls and the ability to filter videos for all but the most child-safe content – although the filters, which are run by an algorithm,\u0026nbsphaven’t always been successful, prompting the company to\u0026nbspannounce a human-curated version.Proposed guidelines to improve child internet safety in the UK from the Information Commissioner’s Office in their \u0027Age appropriate design code\u0027 include:In February, Bytedance, the Chinese firm that owns TikTok, was fined a record ($5.7m) £4.2m for illegally collecting personal information from children under 13. The FTC said the company had previously been aware that “a significant percentage of users were younger than 13”, the age at which US laws mandate strict data protections, “and received thousands of complaints from parents that their children under 13 had created Musical.ly accounts”. Musical.ly was the previous name of TikTok.Despite that, the FTC’s chair, Joe Simons, said, “they still failed to seek parental consent before collecting names, email addresses and other personal information from users under the age of 13”.Bytedance, a private startup based in Beijing, has a valuation of $75bn, based primarily on the extraordinary growth of TikTok and its Chinese equivalent, Douyin. The app is popular among teenagers and preteens for its combination of music and meme-based humour.In April, Lil Nas X found fame overnight when his track Old Town Road was used extensively on 15-sec clips on the social network. That enthusiasm took the artist to the top of the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.TikTok has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82d035d96b50e95daade1fb7c86bb836cf679887/466_762_4685_2811/master/4685.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58e902f8c54f871d72c8a5c5088e7f68","title":"poland lake district rivers canoe kayak cycling","story":"Poland’s lake district is a portal into a world of forests and watery channels – and little else. Ideal for exploring by bike and kayakWe lifted our paddles from the water and let ourselves drift downstream. Deep in a wood, far from anywhere that was anywhere, unseen birds above burst into song in the canopy of spring-leafed trees. Up ahead, sunlight illuminated our way through a tunnel of greens and browns, melting as it touched the water. Emerald lettuce-like plants, blurred out of focus by the current, waved us on our way from below. The air flashed with bursts of blue as little squadrons of damselflies danced around us, heedless of the more cautious flight paths of dragonflies mating on the wing.It’s fair to say that my companion and I were enchanted. It was as if the entrance to this long, narrow and thrillingly shallow rivulet – for which we’d had to scour a seemingly unbroken bed of reeds at the end of a lake – was a portal into a lost world.Until this year I’d never heard of the Great Masurian Lakes, and didn’t know that Poland was home to many. However, to the east of Gdánsk, the province of Warmia-Masuria is known unofficially as the Land of a Thousand Lakes. “But that number’s not really right,” local guide Mariana told me. “There are more like 3,000 here.”I’d reached the region’s capital, Olsztyn, with an Interrail ticket that had whisked me overnight from London via Berlin, giving me a sneak preview of the landscape through the train window. Unlike England’s Lake District, the scenery here is very flat – not quite the ironing-board flatness of the Fens but certainly a landscape that does not like to hem in its inhabitants. Deciduous woods are dotted with villages, hamlets and farmsteads storks nest on the top of poles and grand, high-gabled manor houses. Pretty much everything else is water. I spent a sultry day getting to know one of the north-eastern lakes – Mamry – by doing the gentle, 30-mile cycle tour around it, starting at the town of Węgorzewo. It’s one of 30 routes described in an excellent English-language guide (with maps) available free at tourist information centres. But before picking up my rental bike (£5 a day, wegorzewianka.pl) I popped into the neighbouring Ethnographic Park and Folk Culture Museum.At the park, under the guidance of an expert weaver, I tried my hand at making a traditional rag rug on a handloom. My technique was a trifle ham-fisted, but watching the rug grow was rather satisfying.Across the road at the museum, a wonderful confection in polished wood and glass was my favourite exhibit. “That,” declared the guide proudly, “is Węgorzewo’s first ever television. A local family won it in a competition in the late 1960s and had to go to Warsaw to pick it up. It would have been worth two to three months’ wages then.”Setting off on our bikes, we found ourselves briefly on the Green Velo, the 1,240-mile waymarked trail that follows Masuria’s border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad before plunging southwards.Our own route, along cycle paths and minor roads, brought us to Mamerki forest and the former headquarters of the Supreme Command of the German army. This was a grim reminder of the region’s violent past, and I was glad to leave the murky bunkers and return to the sunshine to climb the museum’s newly built 38-metre viewing tower.The views over the lake proved a welcome antidote, as did a blissful freewheel soon afterwards down a lane flanked by hundreds of tall oak trees.Teutonic knights ruled the area for much of the Middle Ages, so it was fitting to spend a couple of nights in one of their former castles, the Hotel Zamek Ryn (doubles from £75 B\u0026ampB, including spa), which overlooks Lake Ryn. Before dinner I descended to the stronghold’s 14th-century undercroft for a relaxing dip in a little swimming pool. Appetite duly whetted, in a nearby lakeside restaurant I sliced into some placki ziemniaczane – crispy potato pancake, served with steaming vegetables chopped into a tomato sauce.The next day we found ourselves in the Lost World, or the River Sobiepanka as it’s known to mapmakers. We’d hired kayaks at Sorkwity (£10 a day, mazurypttk.pl) and headed out over the sylvan-shrouded Lake Lampackie to paddle a section of the remarkable Krutynia river kayak route, a 68-mile paddlers-only trail that threads its way across the region along innumerable lakes and rivers.When we arrived at the riverside garden of Bar Sobiepanka – several hours, lakes, grebes and red-crested pochards later – a family was singing old Polish folk songs a cappella around a table, while thousands of aspen seeds in feathery clumps drifted through the air, creating the impression of summer snow. Zbyszek, who had come to pick us up, along with his kayaks, cheerily explained why we’d had to resort to our map to find some of the tiny outflows from the lakes. “We put up a lot of signs on wooden poles to show people the way … but beavers came along and chomped them all down.”And so back to Olsztyn, where 11 lakes lie within the city limits. On one of them, Ukiel, sits the ultra-modern Tiffi Boutique Hotel (doubles from £60 B\u0026ampB). I lounged on its balcony, gazing at trick-pulling jet-skiers. Dinner at the lakeside Przystań restaurant next door was washed down with a bottle of crisp Warminskie Rewolucje beer from the local Kormoran brewery.Olsztyn’s surviving medieval buildings include an impressive city gate that became a prison and then a fire station, and the Gothic castle where Renaissance-era mathematician and astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus made the calculations that contributed to the switch from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar in 1582.On a walking tour with Anna, a guide from the town’s tourist office, we encountered a pleasingly foppish bronze statue of the great man beside the river Łyna. “You see how shiny his nose is?” Anna asked. “That’s from all the local people stroking it to bring them luck.”I couldn’t help thinking – given the good fortune the inhabitants have in living here in the first place – that this was being somewhat greedy.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

The dog is exhausted. “Leave the dog at home today,” Ross is saying, soothingly. “Come on, mate. Countdown can watch itself.” Ross and your dad meander along a cliff saying mostly nothing for a whole afternoon, before going home to smoke roll-ups and eat un-reheated chicken escalopes. Away from your dad, straight to camera, Kemp muses on the reality of man. “Unanchored from meaning, away from hope, newly orced from Debra … what is a man when he has nothing? He is just a shell and a dog lead.” He opens the cupboard where your dad keeps all those old bottles of piss. “I’m off, mate,” he says. “Maybe download an app.”“You live like this?” Ross Kemp is saying, as a six-berth houseshare full of drama students screech awake and start leaping around the living room in leotards. Technically, this episode is too on the nose (“Yeah, I trained,” Ross says, arms folded firmly across his chest, as half a dozen 20-year-olds pretend to be cats. “Not like this, though. Nothing like this”). But footage of Kemp and his roving gang of actors delivering Shakespeare monologues outside city-centre pubs in the desperate hope for beer money, and getting quietly but firmly bounced out of there by two men with walkie talkies, earns him a long-deserved Bafta nod.“You live like this?” Ross Kemp is saying, as Luciana Berger strolls into the Workspace Formerly Known As Change UK HQ and casually adds another five or six words to its increasingly unwieldy name.

It left Spitsbergen in Norway’s Svalbard archipelago on 26 March 2018. After 21 days and 1,512 km out on the sea ice, it landed in Greenland on 16 April 2018. Its journey continued to Ellesmere Island in Canada, where it arrived on 1 July.“We first did not believe it was true,” said researcher Eva Fuglei, who tracked the female fox.The institute said in a research paper titled “One female’s long run across sea ice” that the Arctic fox’s journey was among the longest ever recorded. It was so long, in fact, that researchers initially questioned whether the fox’s collar could have been removed and taken on board a boat.“But no, there are no boats that go so far up in the ice. So we just had to keep up with what the fox did,” Fuglei said.The collar transmitted data each day for a three-hour period. Moving across sea ice and glaciers, the fox moved at an average of 46.3km per day and on one day travelled a whopping 155km, when it was on the ice sheet in northern Greenland.“This is, to our knowledge, the fastest movement rate ever recorded for this species,” Fuglei said in the paper.Researchers believe the large amount of ground covered on that day could indicate the fox used the sea ice as a “means of transport”.“The sea ice plays a key role in the fact that mountain foxes will migrate between areas, meet other populations and find food,” said Fuglei, adding that it was the first time they have documented in detail the migration of the species between continents and ecosystems in the Arctic.The fox’s journey has raised concerns about how climate change’s affect on sea ice could impact animals’ ability to migrate.“This is another example of how important sea ice is to wildlife in the Arctic,” Norways climate and environment minister, Ola Elvestuen, told the Institute. “The warming in the north is frighteningly fast. We must cut emissions quickly to prevent the sea ice from disappearing all summer.”The fox was tracked from an area where it would have survived on “marine food resources”, including marine birds. Where it settled on Ellesmere island, it lived off predominantly lemmings, indicating its ability to switch ecosystems.Arctic foxes are incredibly hardy animals that can survive brutal freezing temperatures as low as 50C (-58F). The animals have furry-soled paws, short ears and a short muzzle to help them manage cold climates.In winter food for the fox is scarce and they often follow larger predators, like polar bears, to eat their leftovers. They live on average for three to six years in the wild and weigh up to 7.5kg (17 lbs).The ultimate fate of the fox is unknown – its GPS tracker stopped working in February this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a6472e1c1ba8f31de001284e8f29167345d5b3d/0_45_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5adc0bc88326d330cea18b672a0dbf9c","title":"jakarta residents to sue government over severe air pollution","story":"The Indonesian capital topped the charts for the world’s most polluted city a dozen times in June Tired of breathing in some of the world’s filthiest air, a group of activists and environmentalists in Jakarta has decided to sue the Indonesian government to take action.Air quality in the south-east Asian metropolis has plunged dramatically in the past month and recorded worse conditions than notoriously polluted cities such as Delhi and Beijing.Social media users have uploaded photographs of the Indonesian capital blanketed in smog under the hashtag, #SetorFotoPolusi.On 25 June, the capital registered an air quality index (AQI) of 240 according to the dynamic IQAirVisual index. For comparison, London’s current index reading is 12 while San Francisco is on 26.The Jakarta smog has now prompted more than 30 plaintiffs, including activists, environmentalists, civil servants, artists, and businesspeople to band together and work on submitting a civil lawsuit against the government this month.The case will be filed against the Indonesian president, as well as the ministries of health, home affairs and environment, and the governors of Jakarta, Banten and West Java.“We hope that through this lawsuit the government can improve existing policies and take effective steps to overcome air pollution because current policies are not working,” explained Ayu Eza Tiara, a lawyer from the Jakarta Legal Institute, which is handling the case.“In the last week of June, based on our data, the air pollution index is often really bad,” said Ayu, “It is often high in the red zone, which is classified as very unhealthy.”According to the dynamic IQAirVisual index, Jakarta topped the charts for the world’s most polluted city at least half a dozen times this June.The AQI reading is based on measurements of particulate matter, including PM 2.5, small particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter that can be inhaled and cause serious health problems.Last year Jakarta was ranked the most polluted city in south-east Asia, based on a study by Greenpeace and AirVisual, published this March.In addition to Jakarta’s notoriously bad traffic, Greenpeace believes the city’s industries, legal and illegal smelters, open-waste burning and coal-fired power plants are also to blame.But the Indonesian government appears reluctant to acknowledge the problem.The acting head of the Jakarta environmental agency recently dismissed the poor June readings, saying the government “doesn’t really respond to real-time data” and in general the air quality had been “moderate” this year.Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan has put the problem down to the high number of vehicles on the road, but Greenpeace energy campaigner Bondan Andriyani argues that is only part of the picture.“In 2018 the data showed that traffic in Jakarta was improving, but the air quality, declined. It’s a contradiction,” said Bondan, “The PM 2.5 data showed that number of unhealthy days almost doubled in 2018 from the year earlier.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59eaa212274543705c008ffe89b06c8e3c01b1f1/0_101_1317_790/master/1317.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c585cbce113a999dabe75358aa32be6d","title":"syria accuses israel of heinous aggression after airstrikes","story":"Syria accuses Israel of ‘practising state terrorism’ after strikes reported to have killed at least 15 peopleSyria has accused Israel of “heinous aggression” after alleged Israeli airstrikes killed several civilians.“Israeli authorities are increasingly practising state terrorism,” the foreign ministry said in a statement carried by the official Sana news agency on Tuesday. “The latest heinous Israeli aggression falls within the framework of ongoing Israeli attempts to prolong the crisis in Syria,” it added.Strikes south of Damascus and in Homs province near the border with Lebanon overnight on Sunday killed at least 15 people, Sana and the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, including at least six civilians, among them three children.It was not immediately clear if the civilians died in the strikes or their aftermath, the Observatory said.Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes inside Syria since 2015 targeting supply routes and infrastructure such as the weapons depots of President Bashar al-Assad’s Iranian and Hezbollah allies. Civilian deaths are relatively rare, however, leading to the furious response from Damascus on Tuesday.In keeping with a policy of ambiguity over its activities in Syria, Israeli officials declined to comment on Sunday’s alleged strikes.Syria’s foreign ministry also filed a complaint to the United Nations security council over the attack, demanding accountability, according to Sana. Israel’s “dangerous and hostile” actions would not have been possible without the support of its ally the United States, which protects it on the security council, the complaint said.The Syrian government itself has been accused by the UN of multiple war crimes, including indiscriminate bombing of rebel-held civilian areas and the use of chemical weapons.Sunday’s strikes targeted an Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps headquarters and research centre in a southern suburb of Damascus as well as a military airport and ammunition warehouses near Homs operated by Hezbollah forces, the Observatory said.In response to the attacks, Damascus fired anti-aircraft missiles at suspected Israeli planes, but one stray rocket accidentally hit Northern Cyprus, sparking a fire on the mountainside above Nicosia.The incident marked the first time Cyprus has been caught up in military operations in Syria’s eight-year-old civil war."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebc4c93855dddd434a4eb19b0e206dee9d7c916c/833_756_4920_2952/master/4920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=612cc87fddf76f589b40a26fb997fe78","title":"shanghai etiquette classes in pictures","story":"Against a soundtrack of classical music, children learn social skills, dining manners and deportment – hence the books on their heads to teach them how to walk gracefully.

Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill  The A campaign to attract hundreds of Irish nurses back home from overseas has been quietly “stood down” after a lack of interest, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has admitted. The HSE said the Bring Them Home campaign brought back 120 nurses since July 2015, when it was launched with the promise of recruiting 500 nurses from Britain alone. HSE records released under Freedom of Information last year said three nurses had returned under the scheme between January and July 2018. The figures also stated 15 nurses were recruited under the relocation package in 2017, down from 82 in 2016 and 20 in 2015. All of the nurses who returned under the scheme came from the UK. Minister for Health Simon Harris said in 2017 that the scheme was being extended beyond nurses working in the UK to those anywhere in the world. During 2015 and 2016, the HSE’s national recruitment service paid “approximately €250,000” for the campaign, including on removal and relocation expenses, as well as the costs of flights. From June 2016, costs were paid directly by the hospitals. Last week, the HSE said it had “now concluded” and that it was “stood down”, with hospital groups taking on the responsibility of directly recruiting nurses. Asked when the scheme officially concluded, HSE national director of human resources, Rosarii Mannion said could not recall any formal decision having been taken to end it. “I don’t think there was anything ceremonial about standing it up or standing it down... it just moved on and evolved,” she added. However, Ms Mannion later said financial incentives, worth up to €3,000, remain available to any nurse wishing to return to Ireland from abroad. “But I am not running a Bring Them Home campaign,” she said. “What I am trying to do is keep the nurses (already) at home.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Searing recent heat in Europe was 4 degrees higher due to climate change, say scientistsDetective garda Eve Doherty (51) had received three year sentence for harassing State solicitorConference told lowering tax base a sleight of hand as cost of services passes on to workersTory leadership hopefuls attend hustings in BelfastOliver Callely (27) extradited from US in connection with 2015 incident in nightclubA third of systems that failed inspections during 2013-2018 \u0026lsquostill not fixed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash EPABartra Capital Property Group luxury villas, apartments and a caf\u0026eacuteIrish Water says no incidents have occurred over last 48 hoursRescue 111 hit a sand dune in thick fog while returning from a rescue mission off the Waterford coastSources believe Kevin Sheehy (20) may have been deliberatly targeted after leaving gatheringAlan Mahon (40) was with group of five experienced Irish climbersKildare pub called garda\u0026iacute after incident which it says is \u0026lsquotypical\u0026rsquoMove is most significant expansion of zones since they were introduced \u0026ndash Eoghan MurphyWelfare recipients with teenagers and in rural areas struggle most with nutritious dietEU Council meeting to extend into unprecedented third day after efforts to broker dealCompany wants private owners to pay to fix serious defects in the developmentState\u0026rsquos bioersity at risk, Birdwatch Ireland saysMinisters to examine proposals for \u0026euro10.1m package to improve staff retentionSimon Communities reports \u0026lsquoalarming\u0026rsquo lack of housing for those dependent on HAP"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3944023.1562072822!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit party meps turn backs on eu anthem on parliament s first day","story":"Brexit Party MEPs turned their backs when the European anthem \u0027Ode de Joy\u0027 is played on the first sitting of the new European Parliament.

School for boys has appointed the first female head in its 500 year history, amid suggestions that it plans to go co-ed in the sixth form. Sally-Anne Huang, who is currently headmistress at James Allen’s Girls’ School in Dulwich, south London, said feels enormously privileged to take up the post of High Master next year.The school, which was founded in 1509 by the Dean of St Paul’s Cathedral to educate boys “from all nacions and countres indifferently”, counts the poet John Milton, the diarist Samuel Pepys and the former Chancellor George Osborne among its alumni.But the appointment of a female High Master will fuel speculation that the school is going to press ahead with plans to admit girls in the sixth form.The west London school, which charges £38,991-a-year in fees for boarders, sent out a survey earlier this year to staff, pupils and parents to gather views on a possible mixed sixth-form.The school wrote to alumni last month to explain that there is a “good deal of evidence” that both boys and girls benefit from mixed schooling in sixth form.It pointed out that “most schools in London are coeducational at that age” and that St Paul’s could offer girls an “unparalleled all-round academic education” which would bring benefits for boys too.The idea is to expand the Eighth Form, and therefore not to reduce the number of boys after 16+, and to target around one third of the Eighth Form as girls: this proportion at 16+ has worked successfully at other schools, the school told its former pupils. Ms Huang will replace Mark Bailey as High Master, who is returning to University of East Anglia as Professor of Later Medieval History. Johnny Robertson, chairman of governors, said: “The St Paul’s governing body takes very seriously its duty to preserve the unique qualities of St Paul’s and to ensure the school has strong leadership. “We are now pleased to have secured the services of an experienced and highly regarded Head and we look forward to welcoming Sally-Anne to the school as the 35th High Master”.Philip Hammond fires parting shot at Tory leadership candidates as he says no-deal will cost £90bn Fourteen Russian submariners die in fire on

In a tweet, he described the decision as an important first step toward building a state, but he also expressed concern that the decision would not be implemented properly.It is not clear how Mr Abdul-Mahdi will enforce the order, where predecessor Haider al-Abadi failed.At this time I think Abdul Mahdi was incentivised because of American pressure to put them all in one box in order to protect them, but will they comply? said Hashim al-Hashimi, a Baghdad-based security expert who advises the government.Their compliance hinges on Iran\u0027s receptiveness to these orders, if Iran is not receptive to these orders they will be like the ones Abadi issued.The crisis gripping the Middle East stems from President Donald Trump\u0027s withdrawal of the United States from the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers last year, and then imposing crippling new sanctions on Tehran.Last month, the US ordered the evacuation of nonessential diplomatic staff from Iraq amid unspecified threats from Iran. Since then, there have been a string of attacks on US interests in Iraq, including military bases where American trainers are based and a rocket attack near the US Embassy in Baghdad. Philip Hammond fires parting shot at Tory leadership candidates as he says no-deal will cost £90bn Fourteen Russian submariners die in fire on vesselWho\u0026#39s who in Archie\u0026#39s social circle, from palace play-dates to school with the Clooney twinsComment: Why the Brexit Party is a much bigger electoral threat than the Lib DemsWith just 15 ministers, Germany shows that small cabinets workComment: The British public deserves more than the petty gesture politics of the Lib Dems and the Brexit Party Comment: John Henry Newman is the right new saint for an age where Christians are vilified for their faithPlane stowaway\u0026#39s body lands feet from man sunbathing in his London gardenGreat-grandfather who shot dead his great-grandson, six, with air rifle jailed for three yearsNumber of adults using e-cigarettes rises 70 per cent in two years, while one in four children now try them Debate: is Boris or Jeremy the best person for PM if we leave without a deal?Duchess of Cambridge swaps Wimbledon Royal Box for Court 14 to cheer on British wildcardRevealed: The full list of BBC stars earning the highest salaries in 2019BBC salaries bill for top stars up by £2m after pay of women and BME presenters increase to close gapComment: It will take an unconventional leader to make no deal a success18 dead as heaviest rain in decade triggers chaos in MumbaiNigel Farage threatens to destroy Tories if they don\u0026#39t deliver Brexit on HalloweenSecret Facebook group appears to show US border agents mocking death of migrant teenagerEnglish Channel swimmer \u0026#39lucky to be alive\u0026#39 after shark attack on Australia\u0026#39s Manly BeachHong Kong protests: Chinese state media cover demonstrations for first time after month of censorshipBBC Woman\u0026#39s Hour presenter suggests men\u0026#39s pay should have been cut ahead of release of top earnersWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/07/01/TELEMMGLPICT000188442663_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqe-RwhsE0QaWXwBLWFApf8hLbS-diyZ4eRsn9OwQRkmI.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"john henry newman right new saint age christians vilified faith","story":"It has been a long time coming.

Mr Johnson’s team has suggested merging the Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland offices into a single department for devolved affairs. In federal Germany, the 16 states each have their own fully empowered regional government, so there is no need for cabinet representation.Business in the German parliament is decided by a committee of senior MPs, not the government, so there is no equivalent of the Leaders of the Commons and Lords. Government whips are elected by MPs, not appointed, and are seen as representatives of backbenchers. They guard their independence and do not attend cabinet meetings.Mrs Merkel is not the first postwar German chancellor to govern with a small group of senior ministers. While the cabinet ballooned to over 20 under Helmut Kohl, her predecessor Gerhard Schröder slimmed it back down.But the system does throw up problems — as Mr Johnson may find. The small number of departments means Mrs Merkel has fewer appointments to offer rivals in order to buy their support.As Mr Johnson may also find, it gets even trickier when you have to ide the jobs up in a coalition — as is usually the case in Germany.In the most recent coalition negotiations, Mrs Merkel was forced to give up control of the three biggest departments — finance, foreign and interior — to other parties in return for their support.That was the equivalent of a British Prime Minister handing over the Treasury, Home Office and Foreign Office, and it left many in Mrs Merkel’s own party unhappy that there weren’t enough plum jobs left for them.Philip Hammond fires parting shot at Tory leadership candidates as he says no-deal will cost £90bn Comment: As a Tory MP, I know

Are you just putting the case for Remain ”After the interview in March, viewers complained that Miss Bundock was “rude and biased” but the BBC responded: “We’re satisfied that by the end of the interview Mr Martin was able to put across his argument in full.”Now however the objections have been upheld by the corporation’s more senior Executive Complaints Unit.It ruled: “It would have been easy for viewers to form the impression that the presenter held a distinct view of her own on Mr Martin’s support for leaving the EU without a deal, and the interview fell short of the BBC’s standards of due impartiality in that respect.”The statement added: “It has been stressed to the presenter that the way questions are framed should make it clear to the audience that this is for the proper purpose of impartial challenge and that a personal view is not being expressed.”Meanwhile the fallout from BBC One’s disastrous Tory leadership debate continues.New figures show a massive , viewers complained about last week’s show, with most alleging “bias against Boris Johnson” as well as favouring “contributions from the south of England”.Earlier this week The Sun revealed that the BBC had admitted presenter Emily Maitlis’s style “may not be to everyone’s taste” – then hastily deleted the jibe.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

From Pakistan to Poland, Israel to Ireland and South Africa to Switzerland, people enjoy the best of British.But there is undoubtedly more to do to turbocharge trade. That’s why we are guaranteeing that under our leadership, Britain will never join a permanent customs union and instead seek to negotiate a comprehensive Canada-style free trade deal.This means Britain will enjoy a fully independent trade policy to compete with the world’s biggest players.It is simply not good enough for a country as productive as ours to hand over its trade policy to the European Union.We intend to leave the EU with optimism and confidence. Britain can walk tall in the world with the lowest corporation taxes to attract business, a £billion boost for our armed forces and a competitive free trade policy.We will have political leadership at the heart of our team from the start of the negotiation with the EU.This will include the best and brightest, like world class negotiator Crawford Falconer. And there will be no need for a Department for Exiting the European Union.So we will fold these resources into a beefed-up Department for International Trade and Digital Enterprise.We want to be a truly Global Britain and this cannot be done on the cheap. We need to be competitive so we will increase our trade footprint overseas by doubling the International Trade department budget.So we must wrap up Brexit as quickly as possible. It’s an urgent priority and that will be our unrelenting focus until it is done.We both voted three times to leave the EU andothers had done the same we would have left by now. We don’t see Brexit as a problem to be solved but as the most amazing opportunity for our country.It is a task which will require confidence, craft, vision and attention to detail. It will require the promotion of some relationships and the resetting of others.And let us make one other thing clear: that team will never include the Labour front bench, which is hell bent on blocking Brexit.There are a few other things about our Brexit plan that readers should know. If we leave without a deal – not an ideal outcome but one that must remain an option – the full £billion orce payment will not be handed over.We will not pay a penny more than is legally required. Anyone who thinks we are going to write a blank cheque to the EU is sorely mistaken. To leave we need an experienced deal maker.Perhaps one who delivered a smooth Olympic Games in . Perhaps a deal maker who delivered £million a week for the NHS after winning a battle with the Treasury. Perhaps a deal maker who is already around the table with European leaders as Foreign Secretary.So today our solemn promise is this: We must be able to demonstrate real progress with the EU by the middle of October. If no agreement is in sight by then we will press ahead with No Deal.No one sensible wants this outcome, butit’s a choice between no Brexit or No Deal then we will never betray the democratic mandate that Brexit won in .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Imagine that!Why the sudden interest in women’s football  I’ve heard more than one person ask.Well, it doesn’t take a genius to spot the cause and effect — put women’s football on to BBC TV and people will not only watch it, they will bloody love watching it, and realise the level of talent possessed by the likes of Ellen White, Lucy Bronze and the rest of the team.It strikes me that exposure and access is the only reason that we as a nation have cared so much less about women’s football than men’s in recent years. In fact, I know this to be true. You know how Maybe you already know this too but just to recap, this isn’t the first time that our nation has fallen in love with women’s football.Cast your minds back a hundred years or so to World War One when any man fit enough to play football had been sent to fight on the front line.Back at home, it turned out that women were completely able to do so much more than stay at home looking after children.In fact they were able to not only take on the men’s jobs — they also took their places on the football field. And people loved watching them.Women’s football was absolutely huge during World War One, drawing crowds of up to , even after the war had ended.These pioneering women managed to achieve phenomenal success and recognition, and they did it at a time when such a thing would have seemed nigh on impossible. They defied society, challenged convention, cocked a snook at tradition and expectation — and changed the mindset of a nation by taking women’s football to unprecedented  heights, all within a couple of years.And they did it because the men were away fighting — and so they were allowed to.And then women’s football here disappeared completely.Why The men came back from the frontline — and they wanted their jobs and their football back.And the women  They were expected to go back to the domestic realm. And, just like that, it turned out  women were no longer considered suitable to be footballers.Apparently, the sport was condemned as “inappropriate for their bodies”. And so began a campaign against women’s football, the sport that had been appreciated by the nation. That culminated on  December , when the FA called on clubs belonging to the association “to refuse the use of their grounds for [women’s] matches”.It would be easy to conclude that they were scared of the competition.With women safely out of the way men could take their rightful place back on the pitch. Incredibly, it was not until after England’s World Cup win in  that women’s football began to be revived.In  the Women’s Football Association was formed, and in  — a full half-century after the ban — the FA allowed its members to host women’s games again.Still, though, until now the attention paid to women’s football has been pretty desultory.But that’s changed, thanks to the Lionesses and to the exposure that women’s football has rightfully  been given. And now finally, after  years, football may be coming home.England’s Lionesses are two games away from winning the World Cup, having shown skill, determination and hard work in the tournament.The way they play out from the back, the way they keep possession, the way they handle themselves under pressure is a real credit to football. The men should take note.I couldn’t be more proud and how fabulous that more than .million tuned in to watch them.To say that I’m excited for the USA game on Tuesday is an understatement.When you’re at boarding school you wear what you’re told, eat what you’re told, go to bed when you’re told. In fact, you spend your le doing what you are told.Yes, sure there is an upside to that – the one thing I craved when I came out of boarding school was independence, and it gave me a survival instinct.But there are lots of downsides, too, which is why I didn’t send my kids to boarding school.Although, on reflection, maybe I should have . . .BREAKING news – the Miss England competition has launched a  make-up free round for the first time.The idea is to support body positivity and natural beauty.For ’s contest,  entrants – including  Bethany Cammack, trolled as a teenage beauty queen –  have been challenged to submit snaps of themselves with no make-up.It is a far cry from traditional Miss England competitions, where most wannabes have been plastered with more make-up than the average Love Island girl. So I suppose, in a way, it is progress.But here’s a more radical thing. Should we  have a Miss England competition at all It’s outdated, old-fashioned and sexist.We should not rate people on their looks but on their character, what they stand for and what they do.No matter how you dress it up, the prize for Miss England goes to the best-looking entrant. With competitions like this still going on, is it any wonder young women are tortured by self-esteem and confidence issues Make-up or no make-up, it is still judging women on how they look  – and pitting them against each other.I didn’t know until now there is  a Mr England competition too, but that is just as bad.Talk about a bitter-sweet level playing field – where men are as obsessed as women about their abs  and whether or not they should be hair-free.WHAT does it say about society when men who beat up women are not jailed  It says that violence against women is often tolerated.Attacks on woman are the most socially tolerated form of violent behaviour.This week a steroid-using, drug abusing body-builder beat up his girlfriend so badly she thought she would die.She was the FIFTH partner this man has assaulted.He was not jailed as the judge  thinks imprisoning a serial domestic abuser would do “no good”.  No good  It would send a signal that it is not OK to beat up women.As this was his fth victim on record, I am sure there will be more, as he has escaped suitable punishment.He should be in jail and the judge removed from office, at the VERY least.IT’S hard not to feel  sickened by the fact Faryal Makhdoom and her boxer husband Amir Khan spent  £, on their daughter’s first birthday party.Faryal, , and Amir, , held the Amazonian-inspired bash earlier this month at the University Of Bolton Stadium – the same place where the couple held their £, engagement party and eldest daughter’s £, second birthday celebration.I’m sorry, but £, for a first birthday party  Where has  their perspective gone Of course everyone wants to throw their child a great birthday party, but a one-year-old won’t even remember the event.Wouldn’t it have been better for Faryal and Amir to have held just a small celebration and put all that money they spent – on something that lasted for just  a day – into a bank account  so that their daughter could eventually put it toward her own flat, or setting up a business when older Sleeping under canvas, even   it is dressed up as a “bell tent”, “eco-pod” or a “VIP yurt”, is my idea of a nightmare.Add to that probably more than , people, a woeful lack of loos, nowhere to hide from the beating sun and nowhere to wash – and it becomes a vision of hell.Yuck.ANYONE  do a massive eye-roll watching footage of Aaliyah, the -year-old Londoner appearing on Channel ’s  Hours In AE Not only was she there because she had just a broken fingernail, she was complaining at having to wait to see a doctor – I guess because the doctors were busy attending to real emergencies.Aaliyah, broken nails were why plasters were invented.You – and your mother, who took you to AE in the first place – need to get real.So do we.

We could end up with a version of Mrs May’s hideous Chequers stitch-up, with a few extra bells and whistles on the Northern Ireland backstop.That won’t wash, Boris. Voters have been conned twice already. They won’t fall for another blatant fudge.Worryingly, Boris has surrounded himself with Mrs May’s most loyal Cabinet supporters — ministers who connived, and failed, three times to get her botched deal through Parliament.He is listening to staunch Remainers like Health Secretary Matt Hancock.He is taking advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay who, for all their Brexit credentials, willingly dipped their hands in the Chequers blood. They each have a CV to protect.Bearing in mind Boris’s pathological craving for popularity, allies are also alarmed by the sudden support of old cronies and arch-Remainers David Cameron and George Osborne.None of them will tell him what he needs to hear: To save the Tories from the Farage sword, Britain must leave the EU as free traders.We cannot sign up to any iety of customs union, single market or EU court.Boris famously loves to be loved. He likes to have his cake and eat it. He hates making hard choices.But this is the biggest decision of his le and he cannot fudge it.Brussels’ greatest fear is Britain, the world’s fth-largest economy, as a free-wheeling tax haven on its western shore.It is, therefore, our deadliest negotiating weapon, and Boris needs to show his readiness to use it.He has frequently hailed Singapore’s transformation from a small, poor nation to a small, low-tax, well-educated, rich one.Against howls of protest, he backed Brexiteer tycoon Sir James Dyson’s decision to move his HQ there.Boris likes to remind us he won Mayor of London against the odds. But it is worth remembering he only did so after almost running out of steam.He needed to have his feet held to the fire with a blunt warning: “Let us down and we’ll cut your f***ing knees off.”Someone should sit down and give him exactly the same message today.THE most striking aspect of the Tory leadership contest has been the articulate energy of all the candidates – including the no-hopers.All are professional politicians whose job is to argue their case, sometimes without notes, and win over the hearts and minds of voters.It is only striking because Theresa May ­possessed none of those skills.Now we discover her Madame Tussauds waxwork has been given the heave-ho.

Trips to Bulgaria have doubled since  and it looks set to continue… with bookings for summer  up  per cent on last year.”In April, Thomas Cook said in its holiday report that Brits were increasingly looking beyond Europe for their summer break.While Spain was the number one destination for flights, countries such as Turkey and Tunisia were coming back in favour.The tour operator saw a  per cent increase in flight-only bookings to Turkey at the start of this year, overtaking Greece, which the tour operator said was the third most popular destination.And Tunisia was the third most popular holiday spot for Thomas Cook before the devastating  Sousse attacks.Its made a steady move up the rankings since February this year, and is now the seventh most popular destination for Thomas Cook customers. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At worst, you’re Love Island’s head of Human Resources.What the ITV show really needs you to be, though, is the one thing you’re very obviously not — a host.Or just someone with enough wit and presence to draw attention away from the feeling I’ve had, ever since the th minute of the opening show, that this series of Love Island isn’t working.That was the moment Lucie arrived at the villa with a list of her own pre- prepared catchphrases. The public, I’d imagine, hated the presumption, but it was hardly unique to her.There’s an air of calculation and entitlement about most of this year’s contestants who, five series into its le, appear to have worked out what does and doesn’t play well with the public and are just killing time by the pool until they cash in on their performance afterwards.This doesn’t do much for the spontaneity of Love Island or the catchphrases which seem to have been replaced by those insanely annoying verbal tics that make the rest of us want to throttle everyone under the age of .Elma on Maura: “The bird has, like, ­literally lost her s**t.” Molly-Mae on Lucie: “I’ve, like, literally had her back in here.”Joe to Lucie: “You’re, like, literally a ­unicorn.” She’s, like, literally not.I think I could live with the bombardment of likes and literallys, though,it wasn’t for the overriding problem with this bunch, compared to previous series.They’re not very nice.In fact there’s a particularly ­indignant and gossipy bunch, centred round Anna, Amy, Molly-Mae and Amber and a couple of weaselly blokes , who are prepared to do their dirty work, that have given it a really unpleasant atmosphere a lot of the time.This has a knock-on effect, obviously.For the first four years, Iain Stirling’s commentary was the show’s outstanding feature.This series, it’s as manic as ever, but so flat and repetitive I’m starting to wonderI imagined the previous triumphs.This is by no means his fault. The deaths of two former contestants before the series began had already put it under huge scrutiny, and the spin-off seems to be that a small-yet-noisy chunk of the audience are now Love Island vigilantes who think it’s their duty to bombard Ofcom with complaints about anything, but mostly nothing.A great shame, as I genuinely love this show, which is normally the funniest and most ­gloriously un-PC event of the year.It still has its moments, of course. AndI had to pick only one, it would be Tommy claiming Molly-Mae “refreshies me,”you really ­pushied me.The inescapable feeling, watching this series of Love Island, however, is that all the innocence and quite a lot of the charm has been lost forever, like, literally.Joe and Lucie — Jucie.Jordan and Anna — Jordanna.Anton and Belle — Bellend.FOLLOWING the main BBC News, from Glastonbury, and The One Show, from Glastonbury, there was a complete change of gear from the Beeb from .pm on Friday.Glastonbury, on every single BBC channel, with the usual cast of thousands playing presenter tag.So a gushing Clara Amfo threw to Mark Radclfe and Jo Whiley, who threw to Jack Saunders, at the John Peel stage, who threw to James Ballardie, who threw back to Jo Whiley and some new bloke called Huw Stephens, who threw . . .You get the point.

past three years whipping up panic about the dreadful impact Brexit will allegedly have on our country.A No Deal Brexit — or “crashing out of the EU”, as Remoaners dramatically call it — would be especially bad, he says.For three years the Brexit-bashing set have spread mad fears about how leaving the EU without a deal will turn the UK into a hellhole in which medicine will run out, food will be scarce and there could even be “violent unrest” as the starving masses ­struggle to survive.Make no mistake, they say, a No Deal Brexit will plunge the UK into chaos.So Grieve came up with a plan to ensure No Deal never happens, which until last night could have sent a wrecking ball right through Parliament.Before Speaker John Bercow decided not to let them be put forward, Grieve and his fellow Demolition Dame, ­Labour’s Margaret Beckett, tabled amendments to the way government spending is authorised in Parliament.In a nutshell, they would have threatened to plunge the UK into chaosany future Prime Minister pursues No Deal.Yes, that’s right: The latest wheeze of the Brexitphobic elite is to prevent the alleged chaos of a No Deal Brexit by bringing about their own kind of chaos instead.The stalled plan — stalled because it can still be re­tabled today or in the next Parliamentary sitting targeting dferent departments’ spending — gives new meaning to the word hypocrisy.It proposed to make it impossible for the Government to fund certain public services unless it promises to ditch the idea of No Deal.Under the amendments, four government departments would have been prevented from spending moneythe Government pursues No Deal.Those were: The Department for Education, the ­Ministry of Housing and Local Government, the Department for Work and Pensions, and the Department for International Development.These departments are ­central to everyday le.Imaginethe Government was physically and legally prevented from spending money on schools, or housing, or transport, or on people’s ­pensions.There would be mayhem.Bus routes could grind to a halt. Schools wouldn’t be able to give kids what they need.Older people would have problems with their pension payments.Grieve’s plan would have brought about the very thing that he and other anti-Brexit moaners have been warning about: A national meltdown.As a spokesperson for  Downing Street said of Grieve’s Remoaner plot: “Any attempt to deny vital funding to Whitehall departments would be grossly irresponsible.”This money is for “crucial areas like schools, housing and welfare”, the spokes­person said. To cut this money off is to play politics with people’s everyday lives. This extreme anti-No Deal plan was clearly aimed at Boris Johnson.Johnson has said thathe is elected Tory leader, and therefore becomes the next Prime Minister, he will take the UK out of the EU on October  “do or die”.It would be nice to leave with a deal, he says.ButBrussels refuses to renegotiate Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, and keeps trying to foist a bad deal on us, then we will walk away without one, he has promised.The anti-Brexit wing of the establishment hates the idea of us making a clean break with Brussels, even though .million of us voted to leave three years ago.And so they will do anything to thwart it — including bringing about a government shutdown.Grieve’s plan would hamper essential government work and potentially inflict misery on huge numbers of people.It confirms how ruthless the Remoaner set has become.There is nothing they will not do to prevent us from walking away from the EU.We now know that these people are not actually ­worried about the wellbeing of ordinary folk in Brexit Britain.That is how they have ­justied their Brexitphobic antics over the past three years — as an effort to “save” Brits from the consequences of a No Deal Brexit.Yet it is clear now that they are more than willing to make people’s lives more ­dficultit helps them achieve their political aims.That is because their ­over-arching, obsessive aim is really just to stop Brexit. It is all they care about. The Grieve wrecking-ball plan shows what those of us who believe in democracy are up against today.We are up against a political class that will do almost anything to prevent the UK regaining the independence that millions of us voted for in the  referendum.They will whip up the politics of fear. They will demonise voters as stupid, “low-information” and xenophobic.And they will let Boris know that they are prepared to mess up government spending — and by extension everyday le —he goes for No Deal without Parliamentary approval.It is a kind of political blackmail: “Do what we want or we will shut down ­government departments.”If it does make its way to debate, MPs must reject this cynical, dangerous, anti- democratic plan and stand up for the right of the next Prime Minister to play hardball with the EU.The vote for Brexit — the largest democratic vote in UK history — must be upheld, however much it offends Dominic Grieve and other moaning MPs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It shook the kitchen.I thought my house was falling down. I went upstairs and looked out window and saw the body.John had been out sunbathing. He is a lodger and is friends with Bob the owner.I saw John outside he was shaking and trembling. He wasnt saying anything. He could hardly speak.My husband called the police. It was horric.John, a software engineer in his s who previously worked for Ticketmaster, has since fled back to his hometown of Exeter, Devon as he comes to terms with the near-miss.The corpse fell from the passenger plane at around .pm as it came in to land at Heathrow following a nine-hour flight from Nairobi.Airline workers said a bag, water and stash of food were later found in the planes landing gear - where the stowaway had been hiding.The body only narrowly missed a packed Clapham Common and High Street where families were out in their droves in the C heatwave.John, who rents a room in the four-storey house from pal Bob Renwick, is said to be struggling to come to terms with the ordeal and is being comforted by parents Michael and Phi.Johns friend said: “He was so lucky not to be hit and killed.

Avoid pollenThe most effective way to control hay fever is to avoid exposure to pollen.But this is easier said than done - especially during the summer months when you want to spend more time outdoors.Allergy UK say the best way to do this is to keep windows and doors closed when inside - especially early in the morning and evening when the pollen count is highest.They also advise avoiding peak pollen times and wearing wraparound sunglasses and a hat to prevent pollen getting onto the face and in the eyes.You should also avoid drying clothes on an outdoor washing line and shower when you get indoors to remove pollen from your skin and hair.. AntihistaminesAntihistamines treat hay fever by blocking the action of the chemical histamine, which the body releases when it thinks its under attack from an allergen. This stops the symptoms of the allergic reaction.Antihistamines are usually effective at treating itching, sneezing and watery eyes, but they may not help with clearing a blocked nose.Theyre available in tablet form and also as nasal sprays and eye drops.. CorticosteroidsCorticosteroidsare used to treat hay fever because they have an anti-inflammatory effect.When pollen triggers your allergic reaction, the inside of your nose becomes inflamed.Corticosteroids can reduce the inflammation and prevent the symptoms of hay fever.They are better at preventing and relieving nasal symptoms including sneezing and congestion.For those requiring rapid short-term relief from severe symptoms, for exampleyou have an exam or driving test, a GP may prescribe a course of tablets.. Nasal sprays and eye dropsNasal decongestants, in the form of a spray, can reduce the swelling in the blood vessels in your nose, which opens your nasal passage and makes breathing easier.Eye drops can treat red, itchy and watery eyes as they usually contain antihistamine to reduce the inflammation.Both nasal sprays and eye drops are available from a pharmacist.. Natural remediesMany people are turning towards natural remedies rather than conventional medicine to alleviate symptoms.Some try inhaling steam to clear congestion while others suggest drinking nettle tea - an anti-inflammatory.A new natural approach is Breaze Vapour Oil, which can be inhaled from a tissue to ease nasal itching, interrupt sneezing fits and clear a stuffy nose.. ImmunotherapyFor those with persistent hay fever symptoms, a GP may refer you for immunotherapy treatment.This involves gradually introducing you to small amounts of the allergen, such as pollen, and monitoring your allergic reaction in a controlled environment.Hay fever, on the other hand, can’t spread from person to person. It’s an allergic response to an environmental irritant such as pollen or dust.The nasal cavity contains cells that recognise foreign substances such as bugs and pollen.Once the body detects a bug or irritant, it activates an army of T cells that hunt down and destroy the substance. This is known as an immune response.In hay fever, the irritant triggers the same immune cells as viruses. But it also causes the release of IgE antibodies and histamines to produce an ongoing blocked nose, impaired sense of smell, and nasal inflammation.Both hay fever and the common cold causes sneezing, runny or stuffy nose and coughing.One of the key dferences is the colour of the nasal discharge - also known as snot, says Prof Ghildyal.She said: It’s more likely to be a yellowish green colour in colds, while in hay fever, it’s clear.Facial itchiness – especially around the eyes or throat – is a symptom typically only seen with hay fever.If someone is allergic to a seasonal environmental trigger such as pollen, their symptoms may be restricted to particular seasons of the year.Butyou’re allergic to dust or smoke, symptoms may last all year long.Hay fever, like asthma, is an allergic disease and can sometimes cause similar symptoms, such as coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath.A sore throat, on the other hand, is generally a precursor to cold.If you have cold-like symptoms and a sore throat or have had one in the last few days, your condition is more likely to be the common cold.An allergy test, using a skin prick or blood test, for allergen-specic IgE could inform you of the specic irritants that trigger your condition.These tests can be organised through your GP or pharmacist.Oral antihistamines are effective in hay fever patients with mild to moderate disease, particularly in those whose main symptoms are palatal itch, sneezing, rhinorrhoea, or eye symptoms hay fever treatments.Generally, treatment isn’t necessary for a cold but over-the-counter medications such as paracetamol and ibuprofen can help relieve some of the symptoms."},{"url":null,"title":"nike scrap air max colin kaepernick","story":"The sneaker giant reportedly ditched the in-demand £ sports shoes - which had already been sent to shops - after a complaint from outspoken NFL star Colin Kaepernick.The former San Francisco ers quarterback said he felt the use of the th century Betsy Ross Flag carried slavery connotations, sources told The Wall Street Journal.After pics of the shoe were posted online, Kaepernick - a Nike ambassador - is said to have contacted the company saying he and others felt the flag was offensive because of its connection to an era of slavery.In response, a Nike spokeswoman said: “Nike has chosen not to release the Air Max  Quick Strike Fourth of July as it featured the old version of the American flag.”Nike had already shipped the shoes to stores when it asked for them to be ed without any further explanation, according to the reports.At the time pushed for the expansion of slavery and stated that those born into slavery were destined to be slaves for le.The flag got its name from the woman who is said to have sewn the first “stars and stripes” on the US flag in .However, the flag has more recently been hijacked by some extremist groups opposed to increasing ersity in the US.A  story by The Outline claimed the flag was on display in the home of a member of white nationalist group Identity Evropa.The Betsy Ross Flag has been turned into a symbol of white nationalism and domestic extremism, one person wrote.Conservatives will whine, but Colin Kaepernick was right to speak out and Nike was right to pull the products.However another wrote: Can we just for ONE DAY Attempt to be Americans and be PROUD especially during the th of July!

He told the DailyMr Hunt was “one of the most talented ministers with whom I have shared the Cabinet table”.Unveiling a ten-point plan in London, Mr Hunt said that as Prime Minister he would launch talks in August about changes to Theresa May’s Brexit deal.But— by the end of September — it appeared there was stalemate, discussions would end and the country given final preparations for a No Deal on October .There would be £billion of support for fishermen and farmers, and corporation tax would tumble £billion to . per cent.And in another thinly veiled jab, he added: “People running their own business don’t want a showman. They want a Prime Minister who will lead us out of this crisis.”All leave for civil servants would be cancelled in August unless Whitehall mandarins said their departments were ready.The Prospect Union branded it a “fundamental lack of appreciation and understanding of how hard civil servants have been working”.But Mr Hunt told The Sun: “We have to implement the referendum. And it’s the responsibility of a Prime Minister to do so in a way that minimises the impact and maximises opportunities.”Later Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt said on Sky News that Germany’s Angela Merkel had already told him: “Of course we will look at any proposals made by a new UK Prime Minister.” He explained: “Because she wants to solve this problem, providing we are sensible.”Unlike Boris, , Remainer Jo, , wants a second referendum to reverse Brexit.BoJo and his team were caught on the back foot. But in a counter attack he claimed Mr Hunt was not “serious” about delivering No Deal as he had repeatedly refused to commit to leaving by October .He added: “You can’t keep saying we’re going to have a deadline of October  and then say it’s actually not really a deadline at all.”However some backers fear Boris is being outflanked. A senior MP said: “Jeremy’s only a born-again Brexiteer and what he’s saying won’t wash with members. But we should be coming out with detail like this.”The EU has to know for the first time that we are serious about leaving with No DealBrussels maintains the fiction that it cannot offer anything more.Their deal with Theresa May is dead.Ireland’s posturing PM Leo Varadkar loves hearing himself say Britain must swallow it — but our MPs won’t.So Hunt is right to say thatnothing  is forthcoming by September , we will end negotiations and spend a month making final preparations for a rocky exit. An emergency Budget. Huge sums found to keep certain industries afloat. Civil service holidays scrapped.Hunt, though, is unlikely to become PM. Andhe does we doubt even he believes he would preside over No Deal.Boris Johnson is more likely to do both — and must have a similar strategy. It was crazy that Mrs May did not.Today Dominic Grieve’s bid to block No Deal by threatening to inflict ­poverty on millions may be put to a vote. Labour may back it. Good luck explaining that to pensioners and those on benefits.No Deal remains the fallback. Let’s be as ready as we can.He also warned there would almost certainly be a disastrous border poll in Northern Ireland.The Scot said on Monday: “We know they’re real threats, there’s no point pretending they’re not there. Therefore we have to put in place the details of what No Deal would look like, including how we protect crucial industries like fishing and farming and how we deal with small businesses.”He went on: “It’s not good enough to simply say we are going to have a No Deal.

They fear what he represents, what he articulates and what he is able to spark, not just in Black Britain but in an age group empowered enough to turn their frustrations into votes. But their arrows burn in the fire of his social commentary with a Union Jack stab vest to ignite awareness over kne crime, social and judicial inequality and so much more. Stormzy’s influential critics lambast him for “F*** Boris ” but praise Johnson for “F*** business”.  They forget the awe in which they held Seventies iconoclasts such as the Sex Pistols and The Clash to train their fire on a man single-handedly inspiring a generation. Glastonbury , remember, is a largely white, middle-class festival. Yet Croydon-born Stormzy drilled down into the universal disenchantment – across colour lines – far beyond Somerset. So much of the UK is angry at being left betrayed, neglected and disenfranchised.  A Prime Minister-in-waiting promising tax cuts for the rich as families rely on food banks to feed their kids, free TV licences are scrapped for the elderly and as the NHS remains criminally underfunded, tells you everything. Stormzy’s set has been hailed as “a victory lap for Black British culture”. Not yet. Not when the footballer Raheem Sterling has to appeal to our media to address their unconscious bias against young black men. Not when, in , the direction of this country’s politics, sport and entertainment continues to be determined by white men and women. And not when the spiral of hopelessness for so many leads Stormzy to quote the Tottenham Labour MP David Lammy reminding us that: “Young people are repeatedly trapped in a culture of criminality.The system isn’t working. If reciism rates are % for black men then something isn’t working.” Summing up the American justice system last month, Ava DuVernay , director of the brilliant documentary When They See Us, said: “It is not broken. It was built to be that way.” Stormzy, Sterling and others are challenging the system over here. A generation is ready to show that they are listening.

But none of the pictures revealed the one thing many people really wanted to know - has the little royal inherited his dad Prince Harryaposs hair colour  He was wearing a hat in the first photos, and the Motheraposs Day photo the couple shared on Instagram showed just his feet. The Fatheraposs Day post had been filtered so the colours were not correct. But now a expert has looked back at the snaps to aposrevealapos the true colour.    Jordan Lloyd, of Dynamichrome, which specialises in high fidelity colour reconstruction believes the little royal wonapost get Harryaposs hair. His analysis, which looks at the tonal values of the snaps, shows that Archieaposs hair will probably be brown. He told the Star Online: “Looking at this photograph, we can see that Archie’s hair is very fair, and hair in babies tends to go lighter or darker for the first three years before going the other way. “If I was to make a guess, we’re looking at a light blond now that may get darker with age, but given the Duchess’ mixed heritage, it is fairly unlikely that Archie’s hair will be ginger like Prince Harry’s as ginger hair is a recessive gene. “I’d guess it will be brown, but only time will tell.”    However he stressed that genetics and hair colour is a very complicated subject. While many people love Meghan and Harryaposs un-royal baby snaps, they have also been criticised by people who believe they should be more traditional. Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine, believes that royal fans are starting to get fed up with this and it wonapost go down wellthey do something similar with his christening photos. The couple are reportedly planning a private celebration for their son as part of their wish to raise him as a private citizen.    Ingrid told the Mail: I think what people want and what people are used to seeing are lovely family images of the baby in the royal Honiton lace christening gown. They wonapost want an arty Instagram shot of Archieaposs foot three days lateritaposs left up to the couple themselves to take pictures and release them. The pictures they issue are so stylised.

The horric impact left a crater in the lawn and smashed a concrete path while a tenant was asleep on bright and warm Sunday afternoon. Startled neighbours heard a loud bang - described by one as a whomp - as the suspected migrantaposs body landed in the small garden in Clapham, south London. The unidentied stowaway, who was wearing a blue T-shirt and denim jeans, landed face down very close to the sunbather, named locally as John Baldock. It is believed the man was already dead, and one neighbour has told how the body was frozen when it narrowly missed hitting the sunbather. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror    The stowaway was hidden within a Kenya Airways plane that was flying over the capital on its final approach to Heathrow Airport. His body plunged from a landing gear compartment as the plane lowered its wheels just before .pm. A plane spotter, who was following the nine-hour flight on an app from Clapham Common, had seen the body fall and arrived at the scene at around the same time as police. Neighbours said the sunbather was lucky not to be killed.    The tragic incident could have been much worse as the body could have fallen on packed Clapham Common, just  yards away,it had fallen just two seconds later, one local said. Witnesses said Mr Baldock was in shock after the stowaway nearly landed on top of him. One of the Mr Baldockaposs friends told the Sun: He was so lucky not to be hit and killed. The impact obliterated the body.” Mr Baldock, an Oxford graduate who is in his s and works for the tech firm Plexi, was dozing in the garden of the terraced house at the time, his friend said.    The friend, who was in the house at the time, added: He didn’t even realise what it was to begin with. He was asleep and then there was a huge impact. “The body literally landed one metre away from him and was obliterated. My friend was very shaken. He said the tenant has left London and is staying with his family. Neighbours described hearing a sickening thud. A female neighbour said: “It was horric. We heard a loud bang. I thought it was from the building work we are having done.     “My husband went to look and saw the body lying in the middle of the lawn. “The man had fallen right next to one of the lodgers who was in the garden at the time. “I’m just thankful it didn’t hit him. He was in shock.”  A next-door neighbour said: I heard a aposwhompapos - I went upstairs to look out of a window. At first I though it was a tramp asleep in the garden. He had all of his clothes on and everything. I had a closer look and saw there was blood all over the walls of the garden.  His head was not in a good way. I realised immediately that he had fallen. So I went outside and it was just then the neighbour came out and he was very shaken. He had been sunbathing and he landed one metre away from him. According to flight-tracking data, the passenger jet was flying at an altitude of just over ,ft and a speed of nearly mph as it passed over Clapham. A male neighbour said: I spoke to Heathrow Airport to askthey were aware of this. If it had been two seconds later, he would have landed on the common where there were hundreds of people - my kids were in the garden  minutes before [he fell].  The common was packed with sunbathers enjoying the weather on Sunday afternoon. The man added: I spoke to Heathrow. They said this happens once every five years. Describing the victim, he said the body was frozen, adding: One of the reasons his body was so intact was because his body was an ice block. The man said a plane spotter in Clapham Common saw the body fall from the Boeing  Dreamliner while following the flight on a tracking app. The plane spotter arrived at about the same time as police and told them the body had fallen from the Kenya Airways flight. The neighbour said: The police had four cars. They were here for about five hours to start the clean-up operation.  He said the body was removed at about .pm and that the clean-up team had ed on Monday morning to continue the job. He added the neighbour that had been sunbathing had ed briefly Sunday evening before leaving again. A woman who lives nearby said she had heard a thump, but thought it was falling scaffolding from nearby building works. Referring to her neighbours, she said: My heart goes out to them, theyaposre going to have to live with that for the rest of their lives. The plane, which took off from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi, landed at Heathrow at .pm, just over ten minutes after police were called. It is thought the stowaway was already dead when he fell from flight KQ near the end of the ,-mile trip.  He would have had to survive almost nine hours starved of oxygen and temperatures of around -C at an altitude of ,ft. Kenya Airways called the death unfortunate and said it was cooperating with British and Kenyan authorities. On inspecting the aircraft police found a bag containing food and clothing at the rear left landing gear. The body - which is yet to be identied - came crashing to earth close to Clapham Manor Primary School. A spokesperson for the airline, which is Kenyaaposs flag carrier, said: The incident has been treated as a sudden death and is now a police matter. The police have already been in contact with the Kenya High Commission to help identy and name the person. It is unfortunate that a person has lost his le by stowing aboard one of our aircraft and we express our condolences.  Kenya Airways is working closely with the relevant authorities in Nairobi and London as they fully investigate this case. The Kenya Airports Authority said it is investigating how the man got onto the plane. It tweeted: We wish to reiterate that safety and security is a priority at our airports and this incident is being treated with the seriousness it deserves. A statement from Scotland Yard said: A post-mortem examination will be carried out in due course. Police are working to establish the manaposs identity. A crime scene was put in place but has since been closed. The death is not being treated as suspicious. Enquiries are underway to establish the full circumstances.

In the same week that saw us all collectively squirm at Ivanka Trumpaposs AGONISING attempt to insert herself in a conversation at the G summit, Meghan Markle was also caught having an awkward moment. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex delighted fans by making a surprise appearance at the Londonaposs first Major League Baseball Game.   It was their third public outing since the birth of baby Archie and the new parents were pictured chatting animatedly to the players and delightedly accepting cute gts. Once the game between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox started, the couple took their seats in the stands and were, by and large, off camera and away from the lenses. However, one beady-eyed observer witnessed what looks like an awkward moment between the Sussexes.    During the game, Harry was in deep conversation with a friend sat to his right. A smiling Meghan leaned towards her husband and began to speak at the same time. Unfortunately, it looks like Harry didnapost realise and just kept chatting to his mate, leaving Meghan to turn back and watch the game. No doubt it was too loud for Harry to catch what his we was saying.    Still, unluckily for the Sussexes it got captured on camera and shared on Twitter with one user asking: Is it my imagination or is Harry ignoring her  Seeing as the new parents look as in love as ever, we doubt that was the case.

But she has grown close to Prince Charles, who is a “positive influence”. A source said: “She sees Charles as a father figure.” The Daily Mirror can reveal the Duchess of Sussex has turned to Prince Charles for support as a royal mum after her relationship with her own dad disintegrated over his tirades, sources have revealed. And Meghan has refused to let her shamed family back into her le as she and Prince Harry prepare for their son Archie’s christening this week.  But her mum Doria Ragland, , will be involved in the tot’s upbringing. One insider told how Meghan, , is ­determined to shower the child with ­only positive influences as he grows up. Her -year-old father, Thomas, recently used an intermediary to “reach out” to his estranged daughter.    But the Duchess has flatly refused to respond to him, saying she has been “grossly betrayed”, despite other members of the Markle family suggesting she should offer an olive branch. And she is said to have developed a “strong bond” with father-in-law Charles. A senior royal source said: “Meghan’s overriding view is that there is no place for her father or his extended family in her le right now. She has a strong family unit around her in Harry, with their ­adorable newborn son, and he has been very, very clear that she only wants ­positive influences for Archie. “If anything she has developed a strong bond with Harry’s father and has discussed the situation with him. “She definitely sees Charles as a father figure, a principled man who has had his le played out in the public eye. “Despite the desperate pleas from the family, there is zero chance of a ­reconciliation at this stage.    “The Queen is very fond of Meghan, as is Charles, and they both believe she has dealt with the situation in a ­dignied manner. The whole family is ­sympathetic on how much she has had to deal with.” Another source added: “Meghan has remained resolute throughout this whole process, she only wants the best for Archie. Her family-related ­struggles have only made her and Charles grow closer. This is in no way about him wishing to replace her father. “Charles just feels very protective over Meghan, and of course Harry, and in anything that may be affecting his family. He is very conscious that joining the family is a major step and is on handMeghan needs any advice at all.” The Prince of Wales stood in for Thomas to walk Meghan down the aisle at the royal wedding last year after her dad pulled out due to heart problems.    Charles is said to have affectionately dubbed her “Tungsten” because she is as “tough and unbending” as the metal. American Doria, who lives in the States, is seen as a huge influence on Meghan and was pictured with her daughter, Harry, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh when Archie was presented to his great-grandmother. She flew to Britain shortly before Archie’s birth to support the Duchess through the baby’s first days. The royal source added: “Meghan’s got some solid people around her but no more so than her mum, Doria. “She’s in constant contact with her despite the distance of her living in Los Angeles. They both have the view of rising above the bad and concentrating on the good things in le.”  Harry said about Doria in the first interview with him and Meghan after they got engaged: “Her mum’s amazing.” Archie is due to be christened this Saturday, exactly two months after his birth, at the Queen’s private chapel in Windsor Castle. The royal couple have decided it will be a closed event with just  guests expected and no access for the press. The decision caused ­controversy after it was revealed last week that taxpayers footed the £.million bill to renovate their new home, Frogmore Cottage.    Meghan has had no contact with Thomas since she wrote him a letter in August last year begging him to stop launching hurtful public attacks on her and the Royal Family. The pair’s relationship collapsed after he gave a string of interviews where he ulged details of private conversations with Harry and his daughter. Last month, his son, Thomas Markle Jr, told of his hopes for an unlikely family reunion at Archie’s christening. The -year-old said: “I can’t say whether I’m going to be invited. “I can’t sayMeghan is going to say, ‘OK, enough is enough and, yes, I want my family back in my le.’” Adding: “I’m on a crusade to better the family image now. It’s going be a slow, long process.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum recalls terrifying premature home","story":"NewsMum recalls terrying premature home birth of baby son with blue skinAmy Cotterell, from Patchway, Bristol, went into labour while  weeks pregnant and has credited her sons survival to a hero paramedicShareCommentsByTristan CorkAmber Hicks:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video dramatic-moment-hero-paramedics-save-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum has recalled the terrying moment she gave birth to a baby with aposblue skinapos in the middle of the night while in bed. Amy Cotterell was  weeks into her pregnancy when she started screaming in agony as her contractions began getting closer and closer. Moments earlier, she had been in the toilet at her home in Patchway, Bristol, when her waters unexpectedly broke. Her frantic husband, Aaron, called emergency services but the call operator feared he would have to perform a DIY delivery using a safety pin and shoelace, reports Bristol Live.    Paramedics managed to arrive just before the coupleaposs baby boy did.However he was breech, wasn’t breathing properly or crying, and was a worrying colour. Everything descended into panic but thanks to the actions of hero paramedic Ralph Whitby, the tot - named Odin - survived.Mum Amy said: “When Odin was born, he was very unwell, and needed urgent medical care. “Odin wasn’t breathing properly or crying, and he had blue skin. So it was a bit of a panic. But Ralph saved him. “If it wasn’t for Ralph our son wouldn’t be here today. No words will ever be enough to express our thanks. Ralph is our hero.  Amy, Aaron, Odin and big sister Gracie were recently reunited with Ralph and his team in much more relaxed circumstances - as the family visited Bristol Ambulance Station to say thank you. The birth was so traumatic that Amy suffered from PTSD, and kept having flashbacks to those moments.She said she was worried about meeting the ambulance crew again, but said she had to do it to say thank you. The drama began to unfold after midnight and into the early hours of December , . A crew, led by Ralph and including paramedic Stuart Dando and emergency care assistant Agatha Child, arrived and realised Odin was breech and coming out bottom first.  He did, and weighed a healthy lb oz, but was not in a good way. Babies are usually born head-first, and a breech presentation can be risky for mother and baby. “Breech births usually take place in hospital as a c-section . But Odin had other ideas,” said Amy. “It wasn’t a planned home birth, and I thought he had been born normally until Ralph said he was breech,” she added.Amy and Odin were rushed to hospital after the complex delivery, where he was kept in intensive care for  days, before being allowed home with his mum. Amy admits itaposs been hard to put such a traumatic birth behind her.She added: “I’ve been nervous but excited about meeting the paramedics, because of how the birth affected me. “Thankfully Odin has settled down, and is doing really well now. Reflecting on that night, Ralph said he had literally just been on a course so knew exactly what to do. “Two weeks beforehand I did the PROMPTmaternity course, which meant the delivery went more smoothly than it could have done,” he said.

Cheryl Holden believes the machines were set up to stop her winning. The -year-old was on a holiday at Camber Sands Holiday Park in Rye, East Sussex with her five-month old son Ashton, partner Gavin Maguire and his family. She said the trip and the park were both lovely - until they visited the amusement arcade there, reports Kent Live. Hoping to win a plush toy for little Ashton, she began playing on a ‘four goes for £’ claw machine but said when she did not win anything after spending between £ and £, complained to a staff member. She said this staff member then opened the machine and changed the setting.  After the change was made, Ms Holden said she put in another £ and won a Dumbo teddy. Immediately afterwards, she said the staff member again readjusted the machine’s setting. Ms Holden said she was glad to have finally won but wanted a second toy for her child.    “All the ones you have there aren’t the ones you can get in a shop,” she said. “They are the sort you would have to order online.” After emptying another £ into the machine over the next few days without winning a single teddy, she said she again complained. “I was not abusive or anything,” she said. “I raised my voice because I was angry but I was trying to make it clear to other parents it’s not possible to win a teddy bear and it’s rigged.”    After spotting the manager’s number in the office while making the complaint, she decided to make her feelings known to him. She said: “I phoned the manager, I asked when would this be getting resolved. “He said, ‘How did you get my number ’ “He laughed it off and said my complaint form won’t get me anywhere.” “He said, ‘You can put as much money in, £, but you still won’t win it.’ She said that she has been going to the park since she was a toddler, has always enjoyed her time there and still holds it in high regard but the amusements’ teddy trouble has left her bemused and frustrated for little Ashton. She said: “My son is five months old, buthe was old enough, he would probably be upset.”    The amusement arcade is operated by Playnation. Playnationaposs company’s people and social responsibility director said he would not be able to comment on Ms Holden’s claims until he has “completed a thorough investigation”. He added: “Please be advised that Playnation Limited is a professional organisation which takes all customer complaints seriously. “We operate in a highly regulated sector and are licenced by the Gambling Commission and the Local Authority to do so we take our licence obligations very seriously. “We are fully committed to keeping crime out of gaming, ensuring gambling is conducted in a fair and open way and to protecting children and other vulnerable adults from being harmed or exploited.” Parkdean Resorts, which runs Camber Sands Holiday Park, has been approached for comment.

The only hope he does have in speaking to Meghan again is arguably his age and his health. Thomas pulled out of the royal wedding just days before he was due to walk his daughter down the aisle, due to a heart condition.

Fans said it was disrespectful and Ingrid Seward, the editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine, believes it was an odd decision and says the piece of history shouldnapost have been modernised. But Meghan was far from the first royal to resign her jewellery, and her mother-in-law Princess Diana actually changed her engagement ring too.    The ring that Prince Charles popped the question with was actually very controversial, and members of the Royal Family reportedly werenapost very impressed.

The woman, who we are not naming, was so terried by his twisted behaviour she stopped going to work and speaking to her family and friends.\u2028 Amphetamine addict Skerrett would use Google Maps to see where she had been, constantly accuse her of cheating, and hurl furniture and punch her when she did not do as he said. During one incident, the -year-old, of Hull, took the sim card out of her phone and damaged the slot so she could not use it and accused her of having sexual relations with her boss.\u2028 He even used threats to kill himself as part of his campaign of coercive control.\u2028    His jealous behaviour not only led her to delete her Facebook account, but she also stopped speaking to her friends and family out of fear of his reaction.\u2028 Philip Standfast, prosecuting, said that Skerrettaposs now former partner had only realised in hindsight when his behaviour had started becoming controlling.\u2028 The court heard how Skerrettaposs campaign started in June  and ended when things came to a head in a shocking Christmas Day beating. Mr Standfast said: Sometimes when they were walking and he noticed someone looking at her he would tell them to aposput their eyes in the back of their heads. On one occasion [Skerrett] was arguing with a friend and she asked him to calm down as he was scaring her. He said he would aposshow her what scary isapos and threw a chair at her.\u2028 He was extremely jealous and controlled her le. He accused her constantly of having sexual relations with friends and looked through her phone.\u2028 A woman, her boss, would pick her up and take her to work and he would accuse her of having sex with her. He would text her at work andshe didnapost reply he would say she was having an affair.

He would check Google Maps to see where she had been.    \u2028Skerrett also limited the womanaposs contact with her mother, father and stepfather who said they noticed she had bruises and had not looked after herself. Mr Standfast aded: On her birthday she went out with her dad and he didnapost like it but he couldnapost stop it.\u2028 In November at her mumaposs she phoned a friend and he told her she had three seconds to get into the kitchen. When she said aposnoapos he threw her into the house and caused her to fall on a shoe rack. Skerretaposs abuse also turned physical, on one occasion he closed the windows in their flat, turned the music on and punched her in the face.\u2028 In July last year she deleted her Facebook account. He checked her emails and when he found she had an account with Booking accused her of having an affair. During another assault, police were called by workers in a bookmakers in the flat below.\u2028 The court heard how an interaction with officers was caught on their bodycams and showed the woman wanting to speak with them privately.\u2028 When she told them what had happened, they entered the property to arrest Skerrett but he had been seen jumping from the first floor window.\u2028 Matters came to a head on Christmas Day after a savage assault saw him throw her over a fence and attack her. Mr Standfast said: On Christmas Eve after drinking and taking drugs he got angry when she called her mum and threatened to take his own le. \u2028The next morning, the drinking continued and he began to get aggressive.\u2028 They had lunch together and when he began to become aggressive the partner went to a manaposs house nearby to call the police. She went back and pretended she didnapost know anything as she had used a  name. They heard sirens and the defendant said she was going with him and they got into a car driven by his sister.\u2028 He then got out of the car and began kicking it and hit his sister.

The attack was witnessed by someone who saw the defendant pick her up and throw her over the fence and saw him hit his sister and the defendant. There is also evidence form the complainants mum, dad and stepdad who indicate that over a period of time contact between them had been reduced drastically and they were aware of a change in her appearance as she had stopped caring for herself and they saw her on occasion with bruises.\u2028    Yesterday Skerrett pleaded guilty to controlling and coercive behaviour, assault by beating and oassault occasioning actual bodily harm on what was set to be the first day of his trial. \u2028He already had  convictions for  offences including affray, public order offences and breach of a non molestation order.\u2028 Mitigating for Skerrett, Dale Brook said the relationship is now over and Skerrett has no intention of going back. He added that during the time he had been taking drugs, in particular amphetamines. He said: It was a destructive relationship. His guilty plea is an important factor, although on the day of trial she has been spared having to give evidence, it would have been unpleasant answering detailed questions about their relationship from that time. The drugs had an impact on his mental health.\u2028 His behaviour was erratic on Christmas Day and was pointing to self harm. You can get an insight into his mental health and that is no excuse but may be an explanation for it.\u2028 Heaposs been in custody for several months and has been clean from drugs and this has made an impact on him. He has a job as a painter and has good wing reports.\u2028 This has given him an opportunity to improve himself. He has an -year-old daughter and him being in prison is having an effect on that relationship but he appreciates allegations like these mean he has to try to rebuild that relationship with her and he is prepared to do that.\u2028 He takes a realistic view that this is a serious matter.\u2028 Judge Jack said Skerrettaposs behaviour during the six months was appalling and said he had controlled every aspect of his partneraposs le. He added: She was in fear of what would happenshe didnapost comply and in addition to that you assaulted by beating and then you assaulted causing actual bodily harm on Christmas Day. Jailing him to a two-and-a-half years, the judge said: This was controlling and coercive behaviour over a period of time.\u2028 Skerrett was also handed a restraining order banning him from contacting his ex-partner by any means.\u2028 "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast britain set","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Britain set for scorcher as temperatures hit C this weekBritain will enjoy sunshine and warm weather again this week, although the heat wont reach highs of recent days and some parts of the country are likely to see rainShareCommentsByMatthew Dresch:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video uk-weather-forecast-showers-start-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe UK looks set to enjoy a scorching week as temperatures rise in the coming days, reaching C in some areas on Friday. Britons lapped up the sun on Saturday as the mercury soared above C during a glorious one-day heatwave. Although the mercury melting heat will ease off, this week will see much of the country bask in sunshine, albeit with showers forecast for parts of the UK.  There will be highs of C in London and south England today, though the less fortunate will see a far less summery c low.  It will be a sunny start for the south of the country although cloud will descend across much of the UK this afternoon. A brighter and warmer day is expected tomorrow as the mercury rises to C in some spots, although there could be some rain in north Scotland. The heat will really pick up on Thursday as south Wales, central, north-east, east, south-east, south and south-west England enjoy temperatures in the low s, with highs of C.  Although it will be sunny across the south of the country, there will probably be cloud in northern Ireland and the north of the UK, with potentially heavy rain in north Scotland. Things will get even hotter on Friday, with forecasters predicting temps to shoot up to C and sunshine across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, although Scotland could again see some wet conditions. Saturday also looks like it will be a scorcher. A spokesman for netweather.tv said: This week temperatures will start in the teens to low s, rising into the mid s but without aof the humidity from the end of June. It’s looking quite dry as the high builds in. There is a good deal of cloud and some rain for Monday spilling in from the north-west but there is a fine forecast for the first week of Wimbledon with sunshine and hopefully no need for the roofs. For much of the UK, it will be a dry week.  The weather follows a sweltering weekend, which saw highs of C in Northolt and Heathrow, making it both the hottest day of the year and one of the warmest June days in around  years But temperatures this week will still be lower than initially expected in some places thanks to a -mile-wide Greenland aposcold plumeapos. Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge said: Itaposs all change after the heat as north-westerly winds from the Greenland area see temperatures drop to the teens from Monday. The North of the UK will be cool with showers or longer spells of rain at times until midweek.Europeaposs record heat finally got to the UK - but it was fleeting. Extreme heat in Europe got across to the UK. More and more heat was pumped north from Africa through Europe. But heat was shunted away from the UK on Sunday as an Atlantic front brings cooler conditions. He added that showers could not be ruled out for today or tomorrow.

She thought she was completely fit and health and was looking forward to celebrating the landmark with her family and friends. But everything changed over a Bank Holiday weekend when she was given the devastating news that she has terminal cancer. The only symptom of the large malignant tumour that had been silently growing in her pancreas was persistent hiccups, which turned out to be a rare sign of the horric disease. But then, on ’s May Day Bank Holiday, she was struck with agonising abdominal and back pain and rushed to AE. There, a string of tests were performed which eventually revealed that, shockingly, Val, who lives near Cambridge with her husband Dave, , has incurable stage three pancreatic cancer.    Val, who is set to begin a six month course of chemotherapy, which doctors have warned may only extend her le for  to  months, said: “I still can’t quite believe what has happened, that I was walking around with this ticking time bomb growing away silently. “I’ll admit I am afraid of what’s to come, and I’m not thinking about the end just yet. I’m not ready to leave everyone. “I still feel like a young woman at heart. Still, every extra day I have makes me thankful to wake up and still be here.” Val, who has three children and three step-children has no family history of pancreatic cancer, and displayed none of the more widely known signs such as unexpected weight loss, jaundice or nausea. In fact, the only slightly out-of-the-ordinary symptoms she can pinpoint are bouts of hiccups, that first started in around , but became more frequent in the year leading up to her diagnosis, as well as occasional bloating and indigestion.    Initially, after noticing her hiccups would often be triggered after eating bread when hungry, she wonderedthey were due to an intolerance, even switching to gluten-free alternatives - which made no dference. As soon as I swallowed the first mouthful of bread, Iaposd hiccup, then every subsequent mouthful, the same thing would happen, she said. Sometimes they were so violent, Iaposd abandon the sandwich. I tried gluten free bread, but the same thing happened. I also have a small hiatus hernia - when part of your stomach moves up into your chest - which I have had for  years, so I thought perhaps that could be the cause too. The hiccups first started in about , but were only very occasional. They got more frequent in the year leading up to the diagnosis, but still - who would ever connect hiccups to pancreatic cancer     According to Cancer Research, hiccups can occur in patients when the stomach becomes extended and bloated, or a tumour is pressing on the diaphragm - both of which were happening in Valaposs case. “The symptoms were all so mild that they weren’t enough to go to the doctors with, she continued. EvenI’d gone and said I get hiccups and sometimes bloat, I doubt that would have got me referred for any tests or scans. “The trouble with pancreatic cancer is that there’s no real screening for early detection. In fact, pancreatic tumours don’t normally cause many noticeable symptoms at first, so by the time they do, it can be too late.” But then, as the Bank Holiday on Monday  May,  approached, Val, who previously worked as a skills trainer in the electronics industry, before retiring in  and setting up her own art studio business, started experiencing diarrhoea and abdominal pain. On Friday May , she decided to visit the GP, just to be on the safe side. There, it was suggested that she may have erticulitis, a digestive condition affecting the bowel. “I was given some antibiotics and told thatthe pain gets too bad to go to AE. It sounds strange but I felt like I almost had permission then to go seek helpneeded,” said Val. “By the Sunday, the pain has escalated and moved up to my back. It was this non-stop searing – nothing made it better, and I just couldn’t get any rest.”    So, on Bank Holiday Monday, Val and Dave, who previously worked as a cable jointer but now, having retired, volunteers at a museum, headed to Addenbrookeaposs Hospital in Cambridge. There, she was examined and a blood test and urine sample were taken, the latter of which revealed small traces of blood, which medics initially took to indicate that she had kidney stones. Next, a CT scan was performed to further investigate what was causing the pain. “About an hour later, I was told that a surgeon wanted to see me,” said Val. “At the time, I thought, ‘That makes sense. If it is kidney stones I may need an operation.’ “At that point, I still wasn’t alarmed and had no reason to suspect anything really sinister. “But then I was taken into a private room, and examined. There, the mood changed and I could almost sense something was coming – something that wasn’t good. “The doctor then told me that a mass had been found on my pancreas. With that, Dave just broke down. I said, ‘It’s not good, is it ’ and the doctor replied, ‘I’m afraid not.’”    After staying in overnight, Val had another CT scan the following morning – this time, with a special dye injection to help improve the quality of the images. She continued: “After the scan, I was back in my room when a crowd of about eight medics came in, and asked my husband to take a seat, which is never good news. “For the first time, they referred to the mass as a tumour and told me I needed a biopsy to find outit was malignant or benign. “They also said that, as it had wrapped around ious arteries and nerve bundles, it was inoperable. “Hearing that was just my worst nightmare come true, but strangely, I wasn’t really feeling emotional – I was still clinging onto the hope that the tumour would be benign, or they’d work out there was something to be done after all.” Sadly for Val, who was allowed home for one night to celebrate her th birthday on May , but otherwise remained in hospital as she was in so much pain, the results of the biopsy revealed that the cm by .cm adenocarcinoma tumour – the most common type of pancreatic cancer - was indeed malignant. Speaking of her bittersweet birthday, she said: I was allowed out of hospital after the second scan but was re-admitted after three days - the pain was just too instense. But going home for my  birthday meant I could celebrate with the family in my own home. It was so good to be able to get out of hospital and be home for the night - but I went back the next morning, where my bed was waiting for me on the ward. Classed as stage three advanced, Valaposs tumour has not spread to any other organs at present, but its precarious position renders it inoperable. “It was so big that doctors told me it must have been growing for quite some time – yet I’d had no idea. That’s why they call pancreatic the silent cancer,” she said. From there, Val was told that she could have chemotherapy, but that this would be to extend her le, not cure her.    She added: “When chemotherapy was first offered, I didn’t know anything about my prognosis. I researched lots about the side effects, and they sounded really quite extreme. “I did have to ask myself whether I wanted to go through that. If I only had a few months either way, would I want to be frail and poorly, or would I want to retain some quality of le  “But when I spoke to the doctor, I was told that, without chemo, I’d have less than six months, whereas with it  I could have between  and . “It’s still not enough, but it’s better.” Now, Val is set to begin chemotherapy, of which she will have  cycles, lasting six months. She has been warned to expect side effects such as hair loss, fatigue, nausea and mouth ulcers. If the treatment shrinks the tumour enough, revisiting the idea of surgery to buy her more time could be an option in the future, but for now, she is determined to do all she can to stay positive. Since her diagnosis, she has been supported by the charity Pancreatic Cancer UK, for whom she has also been raising money to contribute to vital research. By sharing her story, she hopes to raise awareness of the disease and call for early screening to be introduced to help others get a diagnosis before it is too late. She said: “More research desperately needs to be done to help with early detection. We have come a really long way with other cancers, and have screening for things like breast and prostate, but nothing for pancreatic. “Long term, I am not going to survive this, but I hope changes come for people in the future. “I still find it hard to believe this is happening. Sometimes, I feel well and can almost forget about it – then I get a twinge or ache, and it brings it all home. “Still, I have never been a panicker, and prefer to look at the positives. I never imagined this would happen to me, but with my great circle of friends and the support of my family, I still have a lot to be thankful for.” Dianne Dobson, Specialist Nurse at Pancreatic Cancer UK, said: “Hiccups aren’t recognised as one of the common symptoms associated with a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, unlike tummy and back pain, unexplained weight loss and changes to bowel habits. “Some patients may experience hiccups associated with their treatment or in the later stages of the disease. Pancreatic cancer can be particularly hard to diagnose because symptoms are often vague and can y from patient to patient. “You can find out more about symptoms on the Pancreatic Cancer UK website andyou are concerned about any symptoms affecting you, we would suggest that you discuss these with your GP.” Pancreatic Cancer UK’s Support Line is a leline for thousands of people affected by pancreatic cancer.  Specialist nurses understand the issues you might be facing and their expert help and advice will support you in coping with the disease.    weekdays am-pm  nurse@pancreaticcancer.org.uk.

Kerry Burridge, who was diagnosed with an incurable, aggressive form of oian cancer, believes she may not be alive had it not been for the chance telephone call to doctors. After noticing a lump in her stomach, she called her local surgery and luckily they had an appointment that same day because of an earlier cancellaton.If I had to wait two weeks for a GP appointment, I wouldnapost be here today to tell you my story, she told Bristol Live .The -year-old, from Cromhall in South Gloucestershire, immediately underwent scans which showed the tumour had been confined to small part of her oviaries. The illness claimed the lives of both her mum and nan. However, by the time she was went under the kne - almost four weeks later - the cancer had spread to her colon and the tumour had grown to the size of a melon.    When she woke from surgery, she was given the le-changing news that she required a colostomy bag The speed the tumour had spread even shocked her consultant who had not warned Kerry because her previous scans had look so positive. She said: By the time I woke up I had a colostomy bag and the surgeon explained the tumours had been on both oies, one was the size of a grapefruit and the other the size of a melon. I also had small tumours on my liver. “I couldn’t eat for two weeks and I had lost so much weight I was barely six stone. I had to be slowly weaned back on to food. My state of mind and body had taken a hammering. I felt lost and although the nurses were great, mentally it was tough going.    “If I didn’t have Alison, I don’t know how I would have coped. She stood by me and became my voice when I felt lost and out of control. As Kerryaposs recovery in hospital continued, things went from bad to worst when doctors told her the cancer was incurable. She was also suffering from a bowel blockage which meant she was unable to leave the hospital. Everyone is cramped in, said Kerry.    All you hear is beeping or people talking about dying. If I had the strength to get up and jump out the window I probably would have. After being discharged from hospital, Kerry started private healthcare insurance which meant she could undergo chemotherapy at home. “When I finished my treatment that’s when it hit me like a ton of bricks, said Kerry. As well as going into surgical menopause I felt in a very dark place. Before diagnosis I was a fit and healthy woman. I trained and taught martial arts since I was aged  and had a manual day job “My biggest challenge has been the mental impact. I haven’t ed to my fitness levels and have decided to retire from teaching and training in Martial Arts after  years in the industry. Kerry’s latest CT scan has been positive with no signs of any regrowth and they are ploughing ahead with the future and will be bringing together all their friends to form a strong army of women, men and children to take on Pretty Muddy in Bath in September.    The former World Taekwondo Champion has entered Cancer Researchaposs Race for Le for the past  years since her mum died in . In the two decades since my mum died treatment for oian cancer has barely changed, said Kerry. It is the silent killer because early symptoms such as indigestion, back pain  feeling tired are just what itaposs like to be a woman. Very few are going to go and get it checked out. Most donapost realised until it has spread and it is more serious. When I was going through it, I didnapost want to speak about it at all. But now Iaposm feeling better I want to get the message out there to women to know their bodies andthey are worried to go and get it checked out and support Cancer Research. Sadly itaposs likely to affect you at some point in your le so you arenapost just giving money to help someone you donapost know, the money could help you or someone in your family in the future. We need the money now to keep the research going, Experts say many women with oian cancer are diagnosed with advanced-staged disease. This is because the symptoms, particularly in the early stages, often are not acute or intense. The sooner oian cancer is found and treated the better a woman’s chance for survial. Early stage symptoms can be dficult to detect. What are the early symptoms persistent indigestion or nausea. pain during sex. a change in your bowel habits. back pain. vaginal bleeding – particularly bleeding after the menopause. feeling tired all the time. unintentional weight loss.What does Cancer Research say  Alison Birkett at Cancer Research UK in the South West, said: “We are very grateful to Kerry for sharing her story and to highlight the importance of research and awareness, which is key to better outcomes.  “One in two people in the UK will be diagnosed with cancer, at some point during their letime, but the good news is more people are surviving the disease now than ever before.  Cancer survival in the UK has doubled since the early s and Cancer Research UK’s work has been at the heart of that progress.” Alison continued: “Every day,  people are diagnosed with cancer in the South West. To make a signicant dference in the fight against cancer we need to harness as much energy and commitment as possible, and that’s why we need everyone to help in anyway they can, sign up to an event or sponsor someone who is taking part and help make a dference.”  Last year Cancer Research UK spent £ million on research into oian cancer.

Around  randy revellers attended the party in Germany on Sunday, despite temperatures soaring above C. The cruise takes place on Lake Constance every year and has become the largest BDSMboat party in the world. People came from as far away as Russia to attend the notorious party, with curious spectators also lining the riverbank to catch a glimpse of the antics onboard.  One reveller, aposKathrin von Kaliapos, from Moscow, attended the event with his companion aposLatex Angelaapos. Explaining why he made the trip, Kathrin von Kali said: In Germany, people are more tolerant and we can do this whereas in Russia we cannot. Revellers hid their faces behind a range of disguises, including a gimp mask resembling a spartan helmet - and even a horse hat.  Some women were dressed as nuns, while others opted for leather corsets. Paramedics were stationed on board the ship in case any of the hedonists overheated in their fetish gear during the event. Party organiser Thomas Siegmund said guests had suffered breathing problems from tight clothing in previous years.    The festival, which costs €per head, is designed to be a place for latex enthusiasts to meet like-minded people, Thomas added.

From there I caught a ferry from Harwich to Rotterdam and made my way to Stuttgart via Den Bosch and Venlo, which are also in Holland, and on to Koblenz, Mainz and Mannheim in Germany before ending up in Stuttgart.“Once there, I saw round the Stuttgart factory and museum before coming home by train.”Arthur decided to undertake his gruelling journey for Harlow’s Helping Hand as a former colleague had been helped by the fund.He added: “Along the way people asked me why I was cycling such a distance so I told them about Harlow and they kindly donated money. Raising money for charity is one of the things my company does as a way of giving something back to the community.“This isn’t the first long distance bike ride I have completed.“I have previously cycled from Land’s End to John O’Groats with the money I raised going to a charity in Edinburgh named The Yard which raises cash for adventure playgrounds for disabled children.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr form led to dundee united making moves for new boy liam smith","story":"New boy Liam Smith is delighted to be one of Dundee United’s summer recruits and suspects previous employers Ayr United were partly responsible for the arrival of some of the men who beat him through the doors at Tannadice by a few months.It was Tangerines gaffer Robbie Neilson’s knowledge of Smith from their time together at Hearts, plus his form for the Honest Men last term that earned the -year-old right-back his move.In fact, such was his form during the first half of last campaign, United made a bid for him in January before having to settle for fixing him up on a pre-contract and getting his services now.And Smith believes Ayr’s surge to the top of the Championship before Christmas prompted increased transfer activity where in the ision.“I think because we had done so well in the first half of the season and Ayr were considered a smaller club, the bigger sides in the ision got a bit of a fright,” he said.“United, Partick and other teams like them saw we were doing well and thought we have to do something about this, so they signed a few players in January.“There was nothing Ayr could do about the players these clubs were signing, they don’t have the budget to compete at that level and I think they can be delighted with where we finished last year and the season we had.”News Smith would be heading for Tannadice once his Ayr contract was up, leaked out just a day or so before the teams were due to meet towards the end of the season.While he would have preferredhis proposed move had been kept under wraps for a little longer, the way things have panned out, he insists it was not a major problem.“It came out the day before we were playing United, that wasn’t ideal but Ian McCall trusted me and knew that I would give my all for Ayr until the end of the season and that’s what I did.“We didn’t meet United in the play-offs, probably thankfully. It would have been a little, maybe slightly, awkward. When the news came out it was near to the end of the season, so all I could do was give my all for Ayr to win.“And it’s not something you even remotely think about it when you’re playing on a Saturday. It’s not in your head, you are just doing your job in the day.”While he’s known for months he was Tannadice-bound, it was only with the start of pre-season training at the beginning of the week that he was able to get down to working with his new team-mates.And already, he admits, he’s been impressed with what he’s seen.With most of the squad that will be used next season already in place, he is confident the quality required to live up to expectations and secure automatic promotion is there.“Just from the first couple of days of training you can see the quality in the squad and the players the manager has to choose from. To be added to that is, obviously, good for myself and, hopefully, I can stay in the team and do well.“I have experience of winning the Championship with St Mirren so I think I’m ready for that challenge of the expectation of winning games and playing in front of a big crowd at Tannadice. I’m confident that I can handle it and I’m sure we’ll be doing all we can to make it happen.”And he’s made it clear that, for all the Championship is a ision he rates highly, he plans to be spending most of his United career operating a step up from it.“I’m ready to challenge myself at a higher level. It would have been greatUnited had gone up last season but % the aim is to win this league.”"},{"url":null,"title":"memories-pictures-from-across-glasgow-throughout-the-years","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-old-photographs-of-glasgow-through-the-years","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-do-you-recognise-any-of-these-old-photographs-of-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-do-you-recognise-any-of-these-old-photographs-of-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-how-many-of-these-old-photos-of-glasgow-do-you-remember","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-moment-angus-woman-zoe-archibald-gets-stuck-in-toy-car","story":"THIS is the hilarious moment a Scotswoman got stuck in a childrens toy car - and had to be cut out using a bread kne."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-memories-of-happy-days-gone-by-in-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"the-rocket-man-elton-john-tribute-night-heading-to-kilmarnock","story":"A TRIBUTE night to Sir Elton John is set to hit Kilmarnock."},{"url":null,"title":"a-world-of-flavour-on-your-doorstep","story":"STICKING to the same old grub can become monotonous after a while.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

Working with the Kilmartin Museum Education Officers, Field Archaeologist Roddy Regan and the Tarbert Community Castle project team led by Robert McPhail, pupils either spent a half day or full day on the castle site.Each day the children had a guided tour of the castle site and of the ious open ‘dig’ trenches, followed by a viewing of some of the objects found on the site in previous weeks. The highlight of their day was to excavate the soil in their trench and the children enjoyed ‘trowelling’ the soil, then sieving their excavated soil checking for any objects that may have escaped their eye.Finally, at the end of the dig sessions, the pupils gathered round to examine the objects no matter how big or small, they had each found on the day. Over the two weeks, the children found a iety of broken pottery pieces ranging in age and style that included medieval and Victorian pottery, clay pipes, broken Victorian slate pencils, ious colours and style of glass and one silver D coin dating to early s.On behalf of the Kilmartin Education team and the schools that took part in the community dig, we would like to express our sincere thanks to the Tarbert Community Trust for allowing the schools such a wonderful opportunity, to dig on a site that is steeped in history, and is of such historical signicance for the West coast of Scotland but in particular for the Mid Argyll and Kintyre area."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead dental practice to open next year","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowPremises have been found for a new dental practice in Lochgilphead as recruitment problems continue at Mid Argyll Hospital dental suite.Attempts to recruit a replacement for a senior dental officer in Mid Argyll Hospital who retired in November last year proved unsuccessful.

Leaderdale and Melrose at the local authority, told us: \"I am pleased that Newland Assets have listened carefully to the representations they have received concerning the Borders Gateway proposals.\"A Class  food retail store was very much against local and national planning policy for the site in Tweedbank as it introduced out of town shopping but the developer has listened carefully

road layout and visual impact.\"I am very excited about the economic impact this development could have on the wider Borders economy.ldquoSecuring a Premier Inn for the Scottish Borders will help put our region firmly on the tourism map and the economic impact of Premier Inn and the potential for other investors to follow them, is something which must be grasped.ldquoThe revised Borders Gateway proposals will complement the work taking place to develop the Tweedbank Innovation Park and will sit comfortably alongside the public and private sector projects which are underway at Tweedbank at present.\"The pound million Borders Gateway development also includes a BP filling station, a Costa drive-thru coffee shop, and a MS kiosk.And it is expected that the new outlets will create up to  jobs.Although the wider vision of the development had been welcomed, the supermarket part of the plans had come in for criticism.And Newland Assets revised their plans to omit the supermarket earlier this year.Councillor Parker added: ldquoBorders Gateway has the overwhelming support of the public and many businesses in the area and now that the food retail plans have been dropped there is no reason why these proposals should not be fully endorsed by the planners and backed by Scottish Borders Council.\"The economic advantages of this proposal signicantly outweigh the very small number of policy considerations which are left.ldquoAlthough it was right for the planners to raise concerns about the previous proposal, now that the developer has listened carefully to all the objections and amended the plans accordingly to deal with them, the Borders public simply wonrsquot understand why the council isnrsquot backing this ambitious inward investment opportunity.\"It will help bring new

including  around the Eildon area.Among the identied playparks to be decommissioned are  in Galashiels - Balnakiel Terrace, Broom Drive, Croft Street, Kingsknowe, Lee Brae, Netherbank, Roger Quin Gardens, Rosebank Place, Sykes Acre, Waverley Place and Woodlea - four in Earlston - Acorn Drive, Everest Road, Gun Road and Summerfield - four in Selkirk - Bannerfield small park, Fairfield Crescent, Heatherlie Park and Rosebank Quarry - and three in Melrose at Eildon View, Fairways and Priors Walk.Playparks in Darnick, Fountainhall, Gattonside, Lauder, Newstead and Newtown St Boswells are also facing the chop.Opposition councillor Stuart Bell, who represents Tweeddale East, said: ldquoParents tell us that ndash particularly for small children ndash they value small local facilities where the kids donrsquot have to cross busy roads, and parents can keep an eye on them.ldquoThese parents have a right to be consulted on any changes.Council leader Shona Haslam has been driving the plans forward.And she believes that the sacrice of smaller playparks will be worth it.Councillor Haslam said: ldquoOur investment means we will have better and bigger facilities but some smaller sites will have to close.ldquoWe have lots of old equipment in unsuitable locations, for example on concrete standings or in areas that flood easily, are often vandalised, or in a poor state of repair ndash and we are discussing with communities what should happen to these.\"We want our playparks to be the best, but that may mean that some of the single swings or roundabouts may have to go."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-bids-for-online-stampede-following-website-launch","story":"SELKIRK is hoping to attract a few surfers to explore the Royal Burgh with the launch of a new tourism website.The online site went live recently -

today.Representatives from the UK Government, the Scottish Government and five councils that represent the region were in Peebles on Monday to sign the Heads of Terms for investment of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal.The deal is seeking to attract tourists to the area and boost business, and is the result of collaboration between the Westminster and Holyrood Governments and local authorities in the region.It is hoped that the investment will create more than , jobs within the Borderlands region.Infrastructure Secretary Michael Matheson said: ldquoI am delighted we have reached this important milestone in signing Heads of Terms for the Borderlands Deal.ldquoSuccessful delivery of the deal will create jobs, protect existing ones and extend the benefits of economic growth to even more communities across Scotland.ldquoAlongside the establishment of a new enterprise agency for the south of Scotland, and activities of the South of Scotland Economic Partnership, the Scottish Governmentrsquos pound million investment will deliver signicant and lasting benefits right across the region.A full cross border feasibility study in to bringing the Borders Railway to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle also forms part of the deal.Transport agencies either side of the Border will work on a cross-border study for the A corridor as well as exploring an integrated transport system.The package of investment will also include broadband and mobile signal investment designed to bring the region up to UK wide levels of connectivity and a Borderlands Energy Investment Company to generate cheaper energy for the region and help the Borderlands become the first carbon neutral region in the UK.A pound million Mountain Bike Innovation Centre in the Tweed Valley aims to establish a world-class destination for research, development and tourism around mountain biking.John Lamont, MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said: ldquoThis is fantastic news for the Borders ndash this deal is packed full of projects which will boost the Borders economy.ldquoFor too long, the Border at Berwick has been viewed as this line which prevents collaboration.ldquoIt is great to see this deal ignoring this Border and looking at how the whole region can be better served, and the economy better supported.ldquoEvery penny of this pound million investment is set to benefit the whole Borderlands region by bringing in thousands of jobs, millions more visitors and improving connectivity.ldquoI am particularly pleased that the Borders Railway extension will receive this pound million boost for a full study into how we can bring the line to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle.ldquoLess tangible but equally important is the investment in broadband, tourism, business and energy which the whole of the Borders is set to benefit from.Scottish Secretary David Mundell said:ldquoItrsquos fantastic news that the UK Government is to invest up to pound million in the Borderlands Deal.ldquoThis is an ambitious approach to cross-border working between Governments, local authorities and partners which will boost economic growth by helping existing business, encouraging new ventures and bringing a wealth of improvements to people who live and work in the area and to visitors.ldquoThe Borderlands Deal has made huge progress in the last  months.ldquoId like to thank the five lrmlocal authorities who have worked so well together, along with the UK and Scottish governments, to achieve this.ldquoThe south of Scotland and northernmost parts of England operate as a single economic area and it is important the border is not allowed to become an obstacle to development.South Scotland Labour MSP and Scottish Labourrsquos Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Connectivity and Transport, Colin Smyth, has welcomed the news but warned that the Borderlands deal will not provide a quick fix for the challenges facing the region.He said: ldquoHaving been involved in the Borderlands since the beginning, Irsquom pleased to see this deal finally agreed as it has been a long time coming.ldquoThe five local councils deserve enormous praise for developing the projects and getting to this stage, given that many people predicted it would be impossible to bring councils from across the border together in this way.ldquoEveryone now needs to get on with delivering the projects.ldquoThis will not be a panacea for the regionrsquos massive economic challenges.ldquoIt works out at around poundm a year over ten years for the whole of the south of Scotland which is quite modest.ldquoHowever, it will bring some badly needed investment into projects that could make a real dference to the local economy."},{"url":null,"title":"campaigners-ignored-as-eildon-housing-approved","story":"CAMPAIGNERS say their concerns ldquofell on deaf ears after Scottish Borders Council approved a controversial planning development on the foot of the Eildon Hills.Rural Renaissance, the contracting arm of Melrose-based JS Crawford property developers, wants to build  homes on the Croft, near Dingleton Road, Melrose.Some of the new properties would tower m about the height of Dingleton Road, and the council has so far received  objections and representations.However, councillors sitting on Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee, which met on Monday July , opted to stick with planning officerrsquos recommendation to approve the development.Speaking at the meeting on behalf of the lsquoDonrsquot Build on the Eildonsrsquo campaign group, Melrose resident Carrie Henderson told councillors: ldquoBad design has been compounded by certain stipulations made in the planning brief.ldquoThe requirement for a road to loop around the nursery, when combined with the awkward levels on the site, have results in plans for houses on the southern slopes being some  metres higher than the level of the road.ldquoBe in no doubt, this housing estate will be dominant, intrusive and jarring. It will be an eyesore.Philip Neaves, from Edinburgh-based Felsham Planning and Development, spoke on behalf of Rural Renaissance.He said: ldquoThe Croft is an allocated development site that was allocated in .ldquoThe reporter who allocated the site would have been well aware of the sensitivity of the site but has still allocated it.ldquoWhat we have is proposals for  houses for private sale and seven affordable housing units.ldquoThe site, when viewed from Melrose, appears as part of the settlement, not the countryside, and views of the site from the Eildons are limited.ldquoThere are signicant economic benefits to the development, not just for employment during the construction phase but for nearby residents as well.Nearly all of the councillors expressed reservations about the development, but only one, Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, voted against the proposals.He told the committee: ldquoThe fact is the reporter has made a big mistake here and the land should never have been allocated for housing in the first place.ldquoFurthermore, I donrsquot like the fact wersquove got affordable housing as a token gesture, itrsquos not spread out in the site and there are no family homes.\"Do people who need affordable homes not have families ldquoThere are so many objections. Many are from where and they are asking us to step in and protect this site which we as a local authority are charged with protecting.ldquoI really object to this application for a number of reasons.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, who chairs the committee, also criticised the proposals but said he believes it can be acceptedthe council imposes certain planning conditions: ldquoI have real problems with the design and concept. I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"live-updates-excitement-builds-as-lionesses-bid-for-place-in-world-cup-final","story":"Fans will be watching with bated breath this evening as England take on the USA for a place in the Womenrsquos World Cup final.The Lionesses will be in the final for the first timethey can get past the defending champions at Lyonrsquos Groupama Stadium.Speaking ahead of the semi-final, coach Phil Neville said: ldquoWhat I want my players to do is realise they are so close and that we have to go out there and deliver.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour.

The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really.

As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully.

The number of entrants reflect the unmistakable popularity of equestrian pursuits within East Lothian.And for those who prefer more craft-based endeavours, there are numerous prizes for the craft schedules, including floristry, baking, stick dressing, photography and jam-making.

It provides a superb vertical foil to the horizontal expanse of the beautul little town, or Royal Burgh of Inveraray. From the top of the tower, the views can be magnicent, sweeping from the Arrochar Alps, Beinn Ime and the Cobbler above the head of the loch, down to the Firth of Clyde and the western hills of Kintyre. From above, the shape of the geological pressures that created Scotland are laid out impressively. At the foot of the Tower, lies the th century planned Royal Burgh.Climb the Tower , look around, and down. On the way up, visit the bells themselves, fitted like a jig-saw into the space, and see the video display of the bells ringing - an almost frightening sight! On the ground floor is an exhibition of Argyll in the First World War.The Tower has a poignant history. It was conceived and built by the th Duke of Argyll, Duke Niall Diarmid, as a memorial to the dead of the First World War, in particular to the Campbells and the ldquomen of my lands. It was an act of personal piety. Ten bells were commissioned from John Taylor and Company of Loughborough. The ten were cast as a single perfectly matched suite. The Scottish Association of Change-Ringers keeps them perfectly timed, and as the second heaviest set of  bells in the UK, they are known and visited by campanologists from around the world, particularly at the bell-ringing festival . Bells traditionally have names, and these bells are named for the ancient Celtic saints who inhabited the boundaries of the Dukersquos possessions: Moluag, Columba, Mund, Brendan, Maelrubha, Blaan, Murdouch, Brigid, Molaise, and Our LadyStella Maris.The Bells were cast in . First they had to reach Inveraray. The first lorry carrying them broke down in Lancashire. Then the second lorry proved unable to climb the Rest and Be Thankful - like so many other visitors before and after. Two bells and the frame had to be dumped and rescued the next day.Then the Tower had to be built. The Duke taxed all his friends and visitors for money. The facing stone came from the quarry in Furnace during winters, the Duke himself collected rubble in his wheel-barrow for the interior of the fabric. The tower was begun in , and finished  years later in , and the bells hung. The cost was just over pound,, approximately pound million in todayrsquos money. The bells could be heard in St Catherinersquos, across the loch.Before long, the tower was struck by lightning, and with the Second World War, ringing ceased. The Tower became almost ruinous. After the war, Lady Glenkinglas founded the Friends of Inveraray Bell-Tower, and gradually restored the Tower to safety, from where the bells ring proudly today during the summer months for visiting bands.The House of Argyll traditionally belonged to the Presbyterian party, with its strong links to the Hanoverian monarchy. In the s the then Duke married an Anglican Duchess, and built the church of All Saints for the Scottish Episcopal Church. Duke Niall Diarmidrsquos spiritual le was centred here, and the holy stillness of the church reflects that tradition. In his spiritual testament, he asked for prayers each All Soulsrsquo Day for ldquoall who died in the War. A local resident who remembers him avers: lsquoFor Duke Niall, that would have included the Germansrsquo. A poignant place indeed!Visit the websiteto find out more.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Royal an LochanLocated in Tighnabruaich in Argyll, The Royal an Lochan Hotel boasts stunning views of Kyles of Bute.

on  June , but the SNP government extended it using powers devolved to Holyrood months earlier.The second year-long extension was revealed in a letter to the Scottish Tories at .pm last Friday, the day after MSPs left Holyrood for summer recess.Mr Wheelhouse said it would have been ldquoa dereliction of government responsibility not to have considered the licenseesrsquo request for more time.However, Mr Burnett said: ldquoThe fact that this was sneaked out at .pm a day after MSPs had left for summer recess speaks volumes.ldquoThe SNPrsquos lsquobanrsquo on fracking in Scotland has already been exposed in court as a sham.ldquoThis simply confirms that Nicola Sturgeonrsquos government is still saying one thing in public, and quite another in private.ldquoSupporters of a ban, particularly Patrick Harvie and the Greens, must feel completely duped.Critics say fracking, which involves pumping pressurised water and chemicals into underground shale beds to release natural gas, is a risk to climate change and public health.Advocates say it could support hundreds of new jobs and add millions to the economy.Ineos, which currently imports US shale gas to Grangemouth to use as a chemical industry feedstock, has long expressed an interest in fracking in Scotland instead.The Scottish Governmentrsquos preferred policy position is not to support fracking, but it has agonised for years without coming to a final decision on whether to allow it or not.It set up an expert  in , introduced a moratorium in , ordered more research in , and then consulted on fracking in .In October ,

was only a ldquoPR gloss.The government spent pound, of taxpayers money on external legal advice for the case.In March this year, just days before the government was due to give its final decision, the government announced yet more consultations - to clary points raised in the last one - on the business, environmental and regulatory aspects.:SNP ministers delay decision on fracking yet againMr

Scottish Tories about the PEDL  extension, the minister claimed the government was ldquomoving at pace towards finalising its position.However, as the latest consultations only closed on June , its assessments were ongoing.He wrote: ldquoI have approved an extension to the initial term of PEDL  for a period of  months. This will allow a period of time for the conclusion of the policy making process and the licensees to consider their position in the light of the finalised policy in due course.ldquoI appreciate that this may come as a disappointment to some but I assure you that, similar to the effect of the extension last summer, this does not change the Scottish Governmentrsquos preferred policy position of not supporting the development of unconventional oil and gas in Scotland.ldquoI would like to stress that, in the meantime, no local authority can grant planning permission for any proposed fracking or coal bed methane project without advising Ministers, which then permits us to call the application in and we would defer any decision on any planning application that did come forward until the policymaking process on our preferred position is completed.Scottish LibDem MSP Liam McArthur said: \"This is not reassuring news for those whose property sits on or near sites potentially earmarked for fracking, or indeed anyone who cares about protecting our beautul natural environment.ldquoNicola Sturgeon stood up in Parliament and declared that fracking was banned, then her governmentrsquos lawyers stood up in the Court of Session and argued that it wasnrsquot.

On the mouth.One would have expected, following counsel from Supernanny Morgan, for Beckham to have switched to a firm handshake, with a squeeze of the shoulder saved for poignant milestone moments.Why would a father kiss his daughter on the lips, asked Mr Morgan  Love, affection, care. To show her she is cherished and adored, particularly in a world of air kissing and fake intimacy. That they have a special bond.To suggest such a gesture has sexualised undertones shows just how far wrong we have gone as a society. Instead of praising a loving, supportive father and child relationship, people look on with distaste and discomfort.Until she died when I was in my early s I would always kiss my gran on the lips. It was such a special gesture, a sign of our closeness and importance to each other as family. She was mine and I was hers and it was a nice wee thing that made me feel loved.Recently, at a family gathering, I said goodbye to my uncle with a kiss on the lips and the gesture meant the world to me. We donrsquot see each other often and Irsquod forgotten about it. It buoyed me so much that I emailed a friend about it that evening. My dad was never involved in my le and Irsquom an only child, so, growing up with that gesture, it felt like my uncle was marking me out as one of his girls, along with my two female cousins. Itrsquos a tiny thing that feels really special and without a male role model at home, it showed how affection should feel.The thought of anyone condemning this as inappropriate is deeply dispiriting. Itrsquos familial love, a most precious thing.Children must be encouraged and enabled to set their own boundaries, of course. As soon as kissing a family member becomes uncomfortable or embarrassing or simply something the child doesnrsquot want to do, then it should stop.Children have a right to autonomy over their own bodies and itrsquos important they arenrsquot forced to take a sloppy kiss on the cheek from an auntie or give a family friend a hug when they donrsquot feel like it.

However, the character of Elizabeth Windsor is meaningless in any debate about monarchy.The institution of monarchy should have been buried decades,not centuries, ago.

Edinburgh was full of colour and noise, and there was a real sense of hope and expectation. Donald Dewar’s speech in the parliament’s first chamber was one of those moments where the hair stood up on the back of your neck. In my view – as someone in a dferent party to Donald, with very dferent views on the ultimate destination for Scotland – that speech was one of the finest speeches in modern Scottish history.How much of a privilege is it to run the country and how dficult is the top job There’s no doubt that being First Minister of Scotland has been the privilege of my le.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le.

In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmLonghope Leboat was called out this afternoon after the Coastguard received a report of what was believed to be either a parachute, or a sail from a boat, washed up on Swona.

There has to be a commitment to reducing the numbers of geese and not just keeping the population at its current level.“This means we need to see funding that lasts long enough to ensure that the measures take effect and that farmers have confidence that their concerns are being seriously addressed.“I will be closely monitoring the new measures being taken forward by SNH in the coming months and at the outcomes of SNH’s study on goose management in the islands.“I also look forward to hearing how the Minister intends to ensure that efforts going forward are sustained so that farmers in Orkney can have confidence that the Scottish Government are serious on dealing with the problem of excessive geese numbers”.Mr McArthur said that, while the announcement of measures was welcome, progress on the issue will take time and government must remain committed to finding a resolution.He said: “It is clear that the minister recognises the importance of tackling this issue and the scale of the challenge involved. While the package of measures announced by SNH today is welcome, it is also clear that it is going to take time to achieve the objective of bringing greylag goose numbers down to a sustainable level.“That is why it is so important that the Scottish Government now stays the course.

According to SNH, this study will consider the practicalities, cost and location for a number of possible measures bring the birds# population down.SNH also elaborated on a previous announcement of an expansion to the licence to shoot the birds, with a new Orkney-specic licence to cover the period from February  to June  — outside the open shooting season and the time covered by the General Licence, which allows Greylag geese to be shot from July  to August  and during the open season from September  to January .This means farmers will no longer be required to apply to the SNH Licensing team for an out-of-season licence but can make a quick call to the Kirkwall office for permission.The new measures include volunteer shooters being available again this year in August and September to undertake goose control on farms which are experiencing issues with geese.SNH is considering further changes to licences, in particular, a mechanism to increase bag limits, and a possible extension to the General Licence, currently available in July and August, to include May and June.Finally, volunteer shooters will be available again this year in August and September to undertake goose control on farms which are experiencing issues with geese.Graham Neville, SNH’s Northern Isles and North Highland area manager, said: “We understand increases in greylag goose numbers have seriously impacted on farmers and crofters on Orkney.

The concern is that, although resurfacing and general maintenance continues to be done, this may not fix the issue in the long-term.OIC has now engaged a specialist team to look at the issue, who#ll be deploying state of the art equipment to take radar readings through the causeway down to sea level, providing valuable information on its deep make-up.This data will then be used to come up with options for short and long-term maintenance of the road, with general inspections and periodic minor repairs continuing until the results of the survey are fully considered.Due to the nature of the work, there will unfortunately be road closures and a convoy system in place on the evening of Monday  July. The work has been scheduled for between .pm and .pm to minimise disruption, by ensuring that traffic from the last Pentland Ferries arrival has passed through. Delays of up to  minutes are possible.The work will begin with coring taking place, which sees four small cylindrical sections of the road removed, analysed and then replaced. This allows the contractors to identy the make-up of the top layers of the road and calibrate their equipment accordingly.The second stage of the work sees a specialist vehicle driven at usual traffic speed across the barrier a number of times, taking video and radar footage as it moves.The third and final stage sees a piece of hand-pushed equipment moved across the barrier at walking speed taking Ground Penetrating Radardata of the full depth of the structure as it goes. The GPR system emits short duration pulses of electromagnetic energy. These pulses or scans are transmitted into the road and reflections from material boundaries or embedded featuresare detected by a receiver. Through analysis of the reflected signals a continuous D model of the Barrier can then be provided, determining material thickness and construction changes.  This should therefore determine what,any, underlying defects there are within the matrix of the causeway. The survey allows data to be taken down to depths of five metres.The video survey will provide a high resolution and spatially referenced video to enable the visual condition of the surface to be assessed to sub-metre accuracy. This will be matched with the GPR survey to produce a visual model to pinpoint anomalies in the surfacing.John Wrigley, OIC roads and environmental services manager said: #As a key element of Orkney#s travel network, we keep a keen eye on the state of this road.#Our ongoing monitoring has shown that the surface continues to deteriorate despite previous interventions — which would suggest that resurfacing is not going to fix the problem in the long-term.#We now need to carry out this important piece of work to seethere could be a more deep-rooted reason for the issues — which should lead us to an appropriate and cost-effective solution.##Previous survey work has given us detailed information on the top layers of the road, but this new survey will look deep into the construction for voids or other potential failures.  We apologise for the delays that this survey will cause on the night of  July # but we#re sure that local road users will understand that this is necessary as part of finding a long term solution to improving the structure of the road.  We#d ask that road users take their time in the vicinity on the night and would also take the opportunity to remind people of the mph advisory speed limit that already exists on the first Barrier.#East Mainland, South Ronaldsay and Burray councillor, Andrew Drever added: “I accept the concerns that have been raised over a period of time, particularly by motorcyclists, and I am pleased to see this piece of work getting underway.#Once we have the survey results, we’ll be able to look at options and hopefully find a way forward in a short a timescale as possible.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The aim of the pilots was to reduce goose impacts by managing their numbers and by selling goose meat locally.SNH has said the studies confirmed that resident greylag goose populations can absorb substantial losses without any effect on their conservation status.The sale of the meat and funding have also been extended for the Western Isles.Sally Thomas, SNH’s Director of People  Nature, said: “Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. We understand it’s still an issue in some areas, with a dficult balance between conservation, farming and hunting.“Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, by giving them the control to manage goose numbers sustainably through sport shooting, other control, or selling goose meat for profit.”The pilots are now being extended until the end of . The  transitional Challenge Fund will help local goose groups develop business models to generate income from the sale of resident greylag goose meat in the long term.SNH has also said that they and local goose management groups are also exploring other options together, such as more flexible licences when necessary, a review of bag limits in some areas, and egg-oiling.The pilot studies cost about £, over five years to March  and an additional £, to March . SNH is now offering a Challenge Fund of £, to support sustainable management, as well as an additional £, for counts and productivity estimates.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is hugely ambitious but when we are talking about the future of our planet we should, of course, be ambitious and we should be impatient as well. Humanity’s impact on the planet has taken centuries to be understood and reversing the damage done will take time to put right. That is why Scottish Labour has supported the target set by the Committee on Climate Change of net-zero carbon emissions by  which we believe is an ambitious, but realistic, timetable to meet. If we can meet it earlier, we should. Beyond that, across the UK, Labour is calling for a Green Industrial Revolution which means a plan for industry to put the environment at the heart of our economy. It cannot be jobs or the environment, it must be both or neither.: Why are Scottish windfarms being built , miles away instead of Fe  – Dr Richard Dixon: Some facts to tell Extinction Rebellion next time they block the road – John McLellanIn our  UK General Election manesto, Labour also recognised that interim targets are crucial, and we committed to ensuring, when in government, that  per cent of the UK’s energy demand in electricity and heating comes from zero-carbon or renewable sources by . This plan was backed by evidence, based on science and would deliver an energy revolution around the four key areas of energy efficiency, offshore wind, onshore wind and solar power. In Scotland, we have been arguing for a  per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by that point, to play our part in bringing UK emissions down.Reintroducing public ownership into the energy market would also open up the potential to accelerate the timelines for zero emissions. As private, shareholder-owned and profit-led entities, today’s energy companies are poorly placed to lead the way for a wholescale change of focus.While we cannot simply legislate our way to sustainability, the market will not get us there either. Businesses, particularly big business must play their part. That’s why, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced last week that a Labour Government would hold those companies, which do not meet a minimum standard of commitment to the climate emergency, to account. He suggested that one sanction could be to delist them from the London Stock Exchange and so cut off their access to capital investment. This radical approach would ensure that the private sector is forced to play a meaningful part in creating a sustainable economy. We also have the opportunity, in Scotland, to ensure that the necessary switch to green jobs is undertaken in a way that prevents working people becoming the casualties of the sustainable economy we must create. We believe there should be a statutory and representative Just Transition Commission rather the adhoc, temporary one the Scottish Government currently favours. The Climate Change Bill provides us with an opportunity to secure this and so take a planned approach to the radical economic transformation which we need to make.The economic opportunities of a green society go well beyond the role of iniduals as mere consumers to that of re-skilled workers as producers of the energy we consume and the goods and services we make. Trade unions will play a vitally important role in ensuring all industries are ready for the changes ahead. In Scotland, we have a wealth of riches in solar, wind and marine energy still to explore and a workforce with adaptable skills ready to embrace these expanding technologies. Labour’s radical plans to put the environment at the heart of everything we do in government will ensure that our carbon emissions are drastically reduced. But action must start now, and we need leadership from both the UK and Scottish governments to show a new urgency to achieving net zero with action and not just words. That means we cannot go on with green energy contracts, that would support our economy and deliver flagship projects, which are awarded to multinational corporations who then place the manufacturing work overseas.EDF’s proposed Neart Na GaoitheOffshore Wind Farm, worth up to £ billion, will be located  miles off the Fe coast and has the potential to create over , green jobs in the Fe economy. Yet, evidence suggests that the current proposal is for contracts for the wind turbine jackets to be manufactured thousands of miles away in Indonesia rather than at the currently mothballed fabrication yards at Methil and Burntisland where skilled workers stand ready to get back on the job. This would be a double blow to the environment and local economy, which is why we’ve been working with the unions and local community inside and outside Parliament to get this decision reversed and guarantee that the work is placed in the Fe yards. Our new timetable to meet zero emission goals might seem a long way off but by taking to the streets in their thousands, our young people have shown us that the climate emergency deserves all our attention and we, as elected representatives, must go beyond setting targets to taking real and decisive action.It is clear that business as usual will not do. Leaving economic decisions to the vagaries of the market will not work either. We need to plan our way to a sustainable future. So, an interventionist and innovative role by governments is an absolute necessity. That also demands a global perspective that goes way beyond nationalism and the national interest alone.The Labour movement will continue to help lead the way in transforming our economy and so protecting and restoring our environment. We will continue to offer the leadership and solutions required to change our economy to one which is sustainable, puts our planet first and does so in a way that puts people at the heart of the change, protecting jobs and ensuring those with the least are not left to prop up those with the most – and so securing a just transition.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"jeane freeman under pressure over rise in delayed discharge figures","story":"Health secretary Jeane Freeman is under increasing pressure after new figures showed the number of people stuck in Scottish hospitals despite being well enough to go home has risen again.Freeman said tackling delayed discharge would be her number one priority as health secretary when she was appointed in the role a year ago - four years after the government pledged to \"eradicate\" the problem with a £m investment.But according to new NHS statistics out today,  people were affected by delayed discharge in May this year, a rise of four per cent compared with the same time last year when  patients were stuck in hospital and also up from April this year, when it stood at .As a result, Scotlands NHS lost , bed days in May and accrued a financial cost of £ per day for each delay - a total of £. million.Of those waiting to go home from hospital, , were delayed for more than three days, with a a lack of health and social care support accounting for  delays, complex needs for  and family reasons for just  delays.The delayed discharge figures fluctuate from month to month, but they peaked in October last year at ,.: Poll reveals most Scots think SNP ‘not doing enough’ to meet NHS targetsToday Scottish Conservative shadow health secretary Miles Briggs MSP said the statistics showed the Scottish Government was failing to \"get to grips with this problem\".He added: “Delayed discharge is a serious issue which is bad for patients and ends up costing our NHS millions of pounds a year. We need to start tackling this, but instead we have seen no direction from the SNP on how to improve social care and allow these people to leave hospital.“The SNP can’t blame anyone  for these statistics – the responsibility for this lies solely with them. Jeane Freeman said that addressing delayed discharge was her number one priority. A year into the job and the situation is getting worse on her watch.”Scottish Labour’s Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Health, Monica Lennon MSP, said each delayed discharge was a \"drain on NHS resources\" and put people at risk of hospital-acquired infections.“In the month of May alone this cost our NHS more than £million - that’s money that could be spent on medicines, more staff and new equipment. This is no reflection on the hardworking staff but the performance of our NHS is worsening under Jeane Freeman. \"The integration of health and social care services will not succeed unless SNP Ministers make the right resources available.”And Scottish Liberal Democrat health spokesperson Alex Cole-Hamilton said the government needed to ease pressure on hospitals by boosting resources for the care sector.“The Health Secretary should be embarrassed that so many patients are stuck in hospital when they’re well enough to go home, simply because the government hasn’t given care services the resources they need,\" he said.“The scarcity of community care packages is stacking more and more pressure on beds in front line services. We already know that when patients are trapped in hospital their physical health and mental wellbeing often deteriorate. The Health Secretary must take immediate action to eliminate these long waits and get healthy patients back home.”However a spokesperson for the Scottish Government said it was investing £m this year to support social care, and the integration of health and social care services, adding: “People should not need to spend unnecessary time in hospital once treatment is complete. We are continuing to work closely with health and social care partnerships to ensure the good practice which exists in many areas is spread across Scotland.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie

Citizens# Assembly following comments from an SNP MP that it was #the perfect way# to advance independence.The planned assembly of  ordinary Scots is supposed to look at the way forward for the nation as Holyrood ministers set out plans for a possible second referendum on the constitution in the wake of Brexit.David Martin, the former Labour MEP chosen to chair the group, yesterday appealed for the Conservatives and Lib Dems to give it another chance after the parties announced they would not work with it.But attempts to keep the assembly neutral appeared to be underminded when Joanna Cherry, MP for Edinburgh West, shared a video in which she claimed: “I believe this is the perfect way to move Scotland on from the current state of Brexit paralysis created by Westminster and to move us towards independence.”Scotland in Unionwarned the assembly could be “misused” by only promoting the idea of breaking away from the UK.The Conservatives’ constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins previously branded the assembly “a Nationalist stunt to kick-start the conversation about independence”.: Pro-Union parties brand Citizens’ Assembly a ‘Nationalist stunt’Pamela Nash, SiU chief executive, said: “Citizens’ Assemblies are growing in popularity throughout the world, and we have remained open minded about the value of this approach in Scotland any space where the views of the public can be examined and taken into account is to be welcomed.“However, given the statements from senior SNP politicians, and the SNP’s consistent record of going against previous public consultations, many have expressed concern that the Citizens’ Assembly could be misused.”Ms Nash continued: “If, before the assembly has been established, the SNP Government is already giving a strong signal that it will not accept the recommendations unless they happen to be in line with its own goal of breaking up the UK, then we cannot see why the Scottish public should have any faith in this process or, indeed, take part.“If asked, unless evidence emerges that the SNP is prepared to act in good faith, we urge our supporters not to participate in the Citizens’ Assembly.” Veteran Labour MEP David Martin, who will chair the assembly, has called for Unionists to drop their boycott. “I think that is a very disappointing move,” he said.“I understand the heat around the whole constitutional issue, but I have taken this on because I believe it is a genuine attempt to find outthere is consensus on some of the controversial issues facing Scotland.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scots students to be given priority for university medical courses","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Students living in Scotland who want to study medicine at university are to be given priority over those from other parts of the UK in an attempt to relieve the NHS staffing crisis.The policy will see the number of students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland accepted by Scottish medical schools fall at the start of the coming academic year.They will be replaced by students who either live in Scotland or apply from other EU countries, meaning that the overall headcount on degree courses will stay the same.The scheme will be phased in gradually, but will result in  extra Scottish-domiciled students enrolling over the next three years as those from other parts of the UK fall by the same number.The controversial policy has never been formally announced by the Scottish Government, but it emerged yesterday after an impact assessment was published online.The scheme is designed to boost the number of medical students staying in Scotland and working for the NHS, which is under increasing strain due to the nation’s ageing population.Data suggests that students who were already living in Scotland when they applied are almost twice as likely to stay there after graduating than those from other parts of the UK.It is estimated that prioritising Scottish students in such a way will result in an extra  doctors entering the first year of speciality medical training north of the Border every year.However, the impact assessment also acknowledged that students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland were “likely to be disadvantaged” by the policy.It added that the scheme had “caused concern with universities”, some of which were worried about the “unequal treatment” of students based purely on where they lived.The policy may also result in a drop in medical school applications from students based in other parts of the UK, it said, but argued that the benefits to the NHS meant all such issues were justied.Universities Scotland said it welcomed the opportunity for more Scots to study medicine, but that students from other parts of the UK would “unfortunately lose out” as a result.“We will continue our constructive dialogue with the Scottish Government about how workforce needs across the NHS can be met, including monitoring the success of this initiative,” said the body’s director Alastair Sim.Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith said it was “no surprise” that the policy was causing concern among some universities.“The direct cost of increasing places for Scots-domiciled and EU students would be placed on students from where in the UK,” she added.“This is yet more evidence of the deeply damaging discrimination inherent within SNP higher education policy.“It has been warned about the effects of this discrimination for several years but it continues to ignore all the advice it receives. As such it is many highly qualied students who are losing out.”A Scottish Funding Council spokesman said: “Analysis of medical students’ destinations shows that Scots domiciled graduates are more likely to stay and work in Scotland.“By increasing the number of places for those already resident in Scotland, the needs of NHS Scotland have been recognised, with a view to ensuring that Scotland has the number of doctors it needs to support communities across the country.”A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “Evidence shows that Scots domiciled graduates remain working in NHS Scotland in the longer term at a signicantly higher rate than graduates from where in the UK or overseas. “Following discussion with universities, a new target for Scottish domiciled and the rest of EU medical student intake for - was introduced in line with Scottish Government guidance to increase retention of medical students.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

It is an increasing trend in UK and one we should surely reject.So, instead we should indoctrinate them in the ways of continued, pointless consumerism that is managing to waste resources and destroy the environment  Why is this behaviour any more #normal#  These are intelligent young people who know their own minds, ones who can be bothered to get up and make their voices heard.I didn#t advocate consumerism though. Children should not be pushed into anything, including consumption.The reason the older generation are skeptical, they#ve seen it all before.You#ve been reading the Mail again, Ali!For goodness sake, Brian, learn some basic simple science and stop the socialist dogma. Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course.

No formal or transparent selection process was used in her selection for appointment nor was she given a written contract of employment, statement of main terms and conditions or job description.During , following several years of signicant growth, the firm decided to consider promotions from associate solicitor grade to salaried partner. Mrs Mercer and two other colleagues were promoted to salaried partner later that year.However, the following year, when she applied for promotion to the role of an equity partner, she was told she did not meet the eligibility criteria. Mrs Mercer did not find out about the promotions of her comparators at the time they took effect on June , , because they had not been announced internally. Instead she learned about them around  through what she described as the \"office rumour mill\". When she enquired about applying for promotion to the next stage, she was informed that there would be no more movement in the firm for the foreseeable future.Mrs Mercer flagged ious issues about her pay during  and  and the fact that promotions were taking place without any formal or transparent selection process.In June  she informed one of firms partners that she wanted to be paid the same salary as her male comparators and to have her bonus calculated on the same terms as theirs. Mrs Mercer was later told that the firm had decided to defer the issue of her salary and bonus until the end of the financial year as part of a wider review of business and salaries. Following this she lodged an internal grievance, seeking equal pay with her comparators on the ground that she was performing like work with them. Her grievance was rejected as the firm was of the view that her work as a salaried partner was \"not as demanding as that of a salaried partner benefiting from a profit share arrangement\". The legal practice accepted that Mrs Mercer was receiving less remuneration than her male colleagues but did not accept that she was undertaking like work with them. It contended that, although she and her male counterparts were all qualied solicitors, there were signicant dferences in the work they and Mrs Mercer were undertaking both in respect of legal work and other responsibilities.In addition, the respondent contended that,Mrs Mercer proved that she was undertaking like work with her comparators, there were genuine material factors which were not the dference of sex and which explained and justied any dferences in pay.The tribunal found that Mrs Mercer was employed on like work with all her comparators going back six years to June .The firm was ordered to pay her £, in respect of the dference between her gross annual salary of £, and the modied amount of £, going forward. She will also receive £, arrears of annual salary falling six years before the date of her claim in June  along with interest of £, on arrears."},{"url":null,"title":"getting to the open all you need to know","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Losing Hollie was one of those things that you dont ever get over, you just learn to cope with it a dferent way.\"Nothing can bring Hollie back. \"Were just trying to help other people from suffering what were going through - its just horrible. \"We just have to keep going. If we can do this, then its a good thing.\"Mr Maguire, a mortgage adviser, said that he and Susan, who works in retail, have put themselves forward because they believe they must raise awareness around what he called \"an avoidable infection most of the time\". \"If Northern Ireland introduced routine screening other babies would be protected and other families wouldnt have to go through the pain of losing a child,\" he said. \"If it saves any parent, andanother baby lives because of what happened to Hollie, then thats a really good legacy to have.\"Following the inquest into Hollies death on June , , her parents warned other mothers-to-be to take a simple test for the bacteria.The letter has been signed by SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan, Sinn Fein MP Michelle Gildernew, DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Alliance MEP Naomi Long and Jane Plumb, chief executive of charity Group B Strep Support. It states that, while there have been signicant steps forward in its prevention of Group B Strep infection, improvements are possible.It also notes that \"in America, Canada, France, Germany or Italy, Mrs Maguire would have been tested to seeshe was carrying Group B Strep bacteria and offered antibiotics in labour, which would very likely have prevented Hollies infection\".Group B Strep is the most common cause of serious infection in newborn babies in the UK and one of the leading causes of neonatal pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis. On average, two babies each day in the UK develop Group B Strep, and each week one dies from the infection and another is left with a le-changing disability.Around one in four pregnant women carries Group B Strep and the bacteria may be passed unknowingly from a mother to her baby around birth.Most Group B Strep infections in newborn babies can be prevented by testing mothers late in pregnancy and providing intravenous antibiotics during labour to those who test positive. This reduces the risk of a baby developing a Group B Strep infection by up to %. The test would cost the NHS just £ each time, and costs from £ privately.Ms Plumb welcomed the cross-party support for the introduction of routine antenatal screening for Group B Strep here. The charity chief executive added: \"As the letter says, important progress has been made but introducing routine antenatal screening would prevent more babies suffering and dying from avoidable Group B Strep infections, and saving future families from avoidable misery.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38273982.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/POLITICS132.jpg","title":"jeremy hunt says he would keep karen bradley as secretary of state","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The leaders of EU institutions are supposed to impartially represent the interests of all member nations globally and in Brussels.Some leaders discussed the roster of upcoming vacancies, which also include the EU’s top diplomat, the president of the European Parliament and the chief of the European Central Bank , on the sidelines of the Group of  summit in Japan that concluded on Saturday.Mr Tusk wants nominations to be wrapped up soon, seeking to prevent further erosion of public confidence in the EU amid Brexit uncertainty and intra-bloc isions over managing migration.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Council president Donald Tusk, left, with Renew Europe party member Guy Verhofstadt There was hope at the previous summit on June - that more time would clary who should replace Mr Juncker. German Chancellor Angela Merkel backs Mr Weber, the German conservative whose centre-right EPP is the largest political group in the European Parliament but lost seats in the EU elections in May.French President Emmanuel Macron has suggested Mr Weber lacks the political and government experience for such a high-profile role.Mr Weber could still be considered for the head of the European Parliament, which is the EU’s only elected institution.Mrs Merkel said there was still a good possibility for Mr Weber and Mr Timmermans, the top centre-left candidate from the SD group, to be among the winners of the top positions. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives for the EU summit Other leaders from the same political family disagreed.The EPP and the SD are the two biggest political groups in the EU, but both lost seats in May’s polls, where far-right and populist parties, pro-business liberals and the Greens made gains.EU leaders want to fill the positions soon because the European Parliament is set to pick a new president next Wednesday.Under EU rules, member countries choose who will run the commission, replacing Mr Juncker. The parliament must endorse that choice. But the assembly has insisted that only the lead candidates from parties that ran in last month’s elections should be eligible for the post.“The lead candidates is not the only criteria,” said Mr Conte.The commission proposes and enforces EU laws on policies ranging from the massive single market to agriculture spending, and from competition issues to immigration.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker The job responsibilities are huge: Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker negotiate with the likes of US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, while the head of the ECB can set monetary policy for the  nations that use the shared euro currency.The outgoing group of EU officials was lopsidedly Italian, with Antonio Tajani holding the parliament top post, Mario Draghi head of the ECB and Federica Mogherini the EU foreign policy chief.Top candidates include current prime ministers Stefan Lofven of Sweden and Andrej Plenkovic of Croatia. Others mentioned include Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier of France, Greens leader Ska Keller of Germany, Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition chief since .On Monday a spokesman for Mr Tusk said the summit had been suspended and would reconvene on Tuesday morning."},{"url":null,"title":"woody allen makes la scala debut directing comic opera","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The cast includes Christoph Waltz.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Christoph Waltz Allen said his work “resonates with Europeans in a way that they relate to”.“I know when I started making movies  years ago, or almost  years ago, for whatever reason, I always had a very warm and affectionate following in Europe,” he said.“And even when films of mine were not as well received in the United States, always in Italy, France and Germany, all over Europe, they received my films well.“Maybe when I grew up, I was an addict for European films, I watched them all the time. Maybe through some process of osmosis my films resonate with Europeans.”Gianni Schicchi, which he first staged in Los Angeles, is being performed alongside Salieri’s First The Music, Then The Words, directed by Grischa Asagaroff. Most of the performers are students from La Scala’s academy.Allen said he was persuaded by Placido Domingo to direct opera, but it took him a long time to come around.I have a weakness for people who live on the margins of society and slightly outside of the lawWoody Allen“I didn’t knowI had any ability to do this sort of thing. I had done cinema and not even that much stage work. I found it to be a very enjoyable experience,” Allen said.The director said he has long enjoyed listening to opera, but usually sees only the first two acts of a production due to early-morning filming schedules.“What I always wanted was an evening of just third acts, so I could see all the third acts I missed over the years,” he said.He said he would have preferred a dferent ending for the opera, based on an incident in Dante’s Divine Comedy, which sees the title character condemned to hell for profiting from a ruse.“I have a weakness for people who live on the margins of society and slightly outside of the law, so have I have great affection for Gianni Schicchi,” Allen said.“I would not put him in hell at the end of the movie. I would retire him with a good pension and let him go off and lead a very happy le in the country.”"},{"url":null,"title":"campbell welcomes confirmation dup role securing winter fuel payments","story":"East Derry MP Gregory Campbell has welcomed confirmation from the British government that Winter Fuel Payments will remain a universal benefit for all older people thanks to the DUP’s Confidence and Supply Agreement.Mr Campbell received the assurance following a Parliamentary Question to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on means testing of the benefit.Commenting, the DUP MP said: “The decision by the BBC to remove free TV licences from over-s has renewed the focus on universal benefits for our older people.“The future of some universal benefits was drawn into question at the last General Election, but thanks to action from the DUP, a commitment to maintain the pensions triple lock and the universal nature of Winter Fuel Payments was secured.”\"The Winter Fuel Payment is extremely important for many people to ensure they are able to live more comfortably during the colder months of the year. I asked the Chancellor about recent speculation regarding means testing and there was a definitive answer:“The Confidence and Supply Agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party sets out that there will be no change to the universal nature of the Winter Fuel Payment.”He continued: “This is a clear and specic confirmation relating to just one element of what the DUP has already secured through the Confidence and Supply Agreement. It is also a reminder that this agreement was not designed to deliver for sectional interests, but for everyone in our society and applies both in Northern Ireland and right across the whole of the United Kingdom.“Older people in particular should take heart from this statement.

One will not understand this feelinghe is not hungry or thirsty themselves.“The Muslim community in the city has merged these two principles together to raise donation for the people who need food to feed their families.“There is no better time to run this campaign than the month of Ramadan and there is no better local charity to support this good cause than Foyle Foodbank.“We are collaborating with Foyle Foodbank third year in a row for Ramadan fasting challenge. We managed to raise £, first year, £, second year and £, this year with our Ramadan charity fasting challenge donation project.”Foyle Foodbank manager James McMenamin thanked the NW Islamic Association for their continued support.“There has been a steady increase in the amount of money they have donated each year. This enables us to buy food that we’re running low on and will also help with teaching courses in debt management.”InclusionEach year in the month of Ramadan the North West Islamic Association invites members of the local community to take part in a fasting challenge where participants fast for a few hours up to full day depending upon their capability and preference.Families, friends and colleagues sponsor the participants by donating money.“At North West Islamic community centre we also run this donation appeal and set up donation box as well. Most of the people from Muslim community who attend for prayer and other events put money in this box to support this campaign as well in addition to show support for the participants,” Mr Bahli said.“The most impressive thing is that kids at the Islamic community centre break their kitty boxes to participate in this campaign.“All the participants are invited to join the Muslim community at the time of breaking the fast in Islamic community centre on the day of the challenge. There are a selection of dishes prepared for this day by the Muslim families from dferent countries“This project strengthens the bonds between communities and helps to know each other and to understand ious cultures and traditions in a multicultural environment. There is great sense of friendship, building bridges and sense of inclusion amongst the communities.”He concluded: “These types of projects are vital in a society to promote combined efforts for a good cause and aims which are beyond race, religion and nationality.“North West Islamic association is grateful to the participants of the challenge this year and also to the people who have donated money for this great cause this year and years before and for support in future.

Ireland to support the rights of workers to holiday back-pay.Northern Ireland could face a massive public sector back-pay bill after a tribunal finding that police officers and civilian staff are owed holiday pay dating back twenty years.Trade unions have argued that all workers should be included, from both the public and private sectors.There are about , public sector employees in Northern Ireland, official figures show.The public sector bill would be a huge challenge to Stormonts budgets, especially given the payments that will need to be made to RHI claimants.The British government rushed through a two-year limit on miscalculated claims but no such cap was put in place in Northern Ireland which means the costs could be astronomical.Niall McCarroll, Chairperson of Derry Trades Union Council said DTUC will be at the forefront of the biggest working-class action in a generation, demanding that any worker who has had their rightfully earned money withheld, ed immediately.This is in line with the recent Appeal Court hearing, which ruled that workers were owed money as their holiday pay had been based on basic working hours, not the actual hours worked including overtime, which in effect breached European law.The court ruled that miscalculations arose because holiday pay had been based on basic working hours, not the actual hours worked, including overtime.Mr McCarroll said: “Since the Appeal Court ruling all we have heard is how much this will cost the tax payer, impacting on our ability toand indeed provide much needed already stretched public services, whilst protecting budgetary integrity.“There has been no reference to the integrity of workers who have been forced to use foodbanks, went into mortgage arrears, struggling to survive during austerity driven pay cuts, austerity, which seems to have benefitted the already wealthy whilst attacking working class communities.”Poverty payThe trade unionist questioned whether workers might have been spared such hardshipthey were given the correct holiday pay.“This shortfall in take home pay could be as much as £ a month, which is a signicant amount for any worker, especially workers within the Derry and Strabane area, who are already in receipt of poverty pay and terms and conditions which deny them a just and favourable standard of living.“For many workers this shortfall could have been the dference between being able to heat their homes and feed their families.”He added: “Of course, so called business leaders and employers have known about this additional holiday pay entitlement for some time which most chose to ignore, and indeed when challenged by the trade union movement they refused to value their employees and pay out.“The establishment in all its parts has once again been exposed in their continuous cycle of treating working class people and their families as being non-entities within society.“All elected representatives and political parties should come out now, publicly and unequivocally showing solidarity and making it clear that they support workers and their families, in their demand for equality and justice, calling for this Appeal Court ruling to be implemente“The full power and influence of the trade union movement will meet head-on any attempts to challenge this ruling and deny workers their rightful entitlement.”Political responseIn statements to the Derry News, NI’s five main political parties have gone on record as saying they believe workers should receive payments they are legally entitled to.The DUP is however mindful of implications for the public purse and Sinn Féin believes payments should be paid over a timescale which “protects the viability of public services and businesses.\"Ulster Unionist Finance Spokesperson, Steve Aiken MLA, said “urgent clarity is needed” but like other parties was concerned about “budgetary implications” for the Northern Ireland Civil Service and its associated public bodies. He also expressed disquiet about the impact on countless business owners.Stephen Farry of Alliance, who was employment and learning minister in , stands over his decision not to introduce a cap to protect taxpayers from backdated pay claims.He insisted he acted honourably and with integrity and believed that imposing the cap would have been \"counter-productive\" as it could have caused an \"articial clf-edge\", leading to a spike of claims before the cap could take effect.And SDLP policing spokesperson Dolores Kelly said when the issue was first identied, action should have been taken to provide certainty, compensate workers for the errors and to insulate budgets from a signicant hitit would impact the delivery of public services.She also pointed the finger at Mr Farry: “It is a matter of profound regret that the Minister of the time failed to raise the issue at the Executive or introduce measures to limit public sector exposure in conjunction with other parties, Trade Unions and workers.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Chairman of Derry Trades Union Council, Niall McCarroll."},{"url":null,"title":"one derrys esteemed citizens honoured plaque","story":"A plaque will be unveiled this weekend in honour of a Derry trade unionist who was described as “one of the most respected labour leaders” in Ireland.On Saturday th June , the Derry Trades Union Councilintends to honour former Alderman and Trade Unionist Campaigner James McCarron by erecting a plaque at his former family home in Derry followed by a talk and celebration of his le with fellow trade unionists and family members.James McCarron, a trade union leader and an Alderman on Derry Corporation, was one of  people who perished when the RMS Leinster was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat in .RMS Leinster was an Irish ship operated by the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company.

OrsquoHare and Diarmuid OrsquoConnor exchanged points before Keegan and Ciaran Treacy finished the job in added time.Mayorsquos five-point winning margin was a bit flattering and the final result would have been so much more dferent had Down taken all their chances.Downrsquos season is now over, but Tally has laid the foundations for better things to come.Saturdayrsquos defeat may well have been the last game in a Down shirt for a few of the sidersquos older players as there is a plethora of young players just waiting to get their chance and Tally seems to be the man to give them that opportunity.Down: R Burns, D OrsquoHagan, B McArdle, G Collins, R McAleenan, K Kernan, D Guinness, J Flynn, C Poland, C Francis, C Mooney , P Laverty, P Havern , D OrsquoHare , C Harrison .

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

During the Second World War the building was used as an auxiliary workshop. It changed hands in the early s to become Moorwell Motors.Ben Wells, managing director at Project Three, said: ldquoWe are delighted to reveal our plans to restore and revitalise this impressive Penarth building.ldquoWe were immediately struck by the strong architectural style of the faccedilade and the light and space inside. It was clear there was potential to design a scheme that would honour the buildingrsquos character and heritage, while creating something new and contemporary for future generations to enjoy.Features include double height windows in the duplex and both private and communal outside spaces. A full floor penthouse has a roof terrace to the front and back with panoramic views.Dorothy Foulkes, daughter of Stanley Sadler, who designed and built the distinctive building and ran his business from there for many years, still lives in Penarth and recently visited the site of the development.She said: ldquoI have many memories of the garage over the years. Having stood empty for many years, I am delighted it is being given a new and exciting future. It is wonderful that the key features of the original beautully designed building are being preserved and transformed.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it.

The cast includes Christoph Waltz. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Christoph Waltz  --Allen said his work ldquoresonates with Europeans in a way that they relate to.ldquoI know when I started making movies  years ago, or almost  years ago, for whatever reason, I always had a very warm and affectionate following in Europe, he said.ldquoAnd even when films of mine were not as well received in the United States, always in Italy, France and Germany, all over Europe, they received my films well.ldquoMaybe when I grew up, I was an addict for European films, I watched them all the time. Maybe through some process of osmosis my films resonate with Europeans.Gianni Schicchi, which he first staged in Los Angeles, is being performed alongside Salierirsquos First The Music, Then The Words, directed by Grischa Asagaroff. Most of the performers are students from La Scalarsquos academy.Allen said he was persuaded by Placido Domingo to direct opera, but it took him a long time to come around. ldquoI didnrsquot knowI had any ability to do this sort of thing. I had done cinema and not even that much stage work. I found it to be a very enjoyable experience, Allen said.The director said he has long enjoyed listening to opera, but usually sees only the first two acts of a production due to early-morning filming schedules.ldquoWhat I always wanted was an evening of just third acts, so I could see all the third acts I missed over the years, he said.He said he would have preferred a dferent ending for the opera, based on an incident in Dantersquos Divine Comedy, which sees the title character condemned to hell for profiting from a ruse.ldquoI have a weakness for people who live on the margins of society and slightly outside of the law, so have I have great affection for Gianni Schicchi, Allen said.ldquoI would not put him in hell at the end of the movie.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

It was decided that refurbishing would not be value for money.After exhausting other avenues, they approached the Department of Education.ldquoAs a result of a y engagement Minister John OrsquoDowd announced two years ago that his department was prepared to fund a new development.Mr McKerr said they worked with Paul McGilton, senior architect with the Education Authority, and it was decided that, for the next generation, there would need to be a purpose-built centre.Taking over part of the pitch proved somewhat controversial to some members, however the vast majority agreed that it was needed in order to provide state-of-the-art facilities for the youth of the future.\"There were a lot of people with such a stake in the facilities here. They put huge efforts into building it over the years. People had to be reassured that it was going to be of serious benefit to the local community and to everybody who uses the club, said Youth Club Chairman Martin OrsquoNeill.ldquoMany members of Clann Eacuteireann have had a letime association with the Youth Club, the GAA and St Colmanrsquos Hall, and we wanted to respect the legacy made by the people such as Alf Murray, Ambrose Lavery, Pat Mc

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
