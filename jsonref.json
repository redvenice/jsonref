(Getty Images)Arsene Wenger has backed Mesut Ozil to be a ‘huge influence’ at Arsenal after his departure and has urged the midfielder his ‘master his own attitude’.The Germany international was heavily criticised in the wake of Arsenal’s defeat to Atletico Madrid in the Europa League last week, with former Gunners defender Martin Keown claiming that the midfielder ‘was not fit to wear the shirt’.Keown also predicted that the 29-year-old would miss the remainder of the season by feigning an injury.Ozil was a surprise omission from Arsenal’s squad for Wenger’s final home against Burnley on Sunday and has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a back injury.The news of Ozil’s latest injury was met with even more criticism by fans, while reports have claimed that several Arsenal players are unhappy with the midfielder’s attitude.And when asked if the player is aware of the negative reaction towards his own absence, Wenger replied: ‘He’s aware because he’s on social networks, like many people, so he’s aware of that.‘But you cannot always master what people say, you can just master your own attitude.’After months of speculation, Ozil signed a new contract with Arsenal at the end of January and is by far the club’s highest-paid player on £350,000 a week.Wenger insists Ozil’s £350,000-a-week deal is a ‘good investment’. (Colorsport)But Wenger believes keeping the midfielder at the club will be key for the future.‘I think it’s a good investment, the player is top quality, been through a difficult patch at the moment because hes always in and out.‘But once he’s back consistently he will have a huge influence.’Next Arsenal manager odds see new favourite as Buvac slides out of contention"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_10982543.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"can spot camera cash machine","story":"An off-duty officer spotted the camera in this cash machine – could you? (Picture: MPS Specials)It is almost impossible to detect, but there is a camera hidden inside this cash machine.An off-duty special constable with the politan Police discovered it at an ATM in Westminster, London.The force tweeted images of the corrupt machine as a warning to people to always cover their pin number when getting cash out.The tweet said: ‘Off duty @MPSNewham Special Constable has sniffed out a covert camera recording the pin pad of this ATM in @MPSWestminster.‘This is why it is so important to #CoverYourPin when taking out cash.’The special constable just happened to spot this tiny camera on an ATM in Westminster, London (Picture: MPS Specials)According to Action Fraud, there are a number of ways fraudsters can use a cash machine to steal your card or banking details.Using a camera is a more high-tech approach to discovering someone’s PIN. Fraudsters will then look to steal your card and make a large cash withdrawal before you are able to cancel the card,Hidden cameras may be placed in the top or sides of the machine.Other ways cash machines can be targeted include by attaching a skimmer that fits over the card slot and is made to look like a normal part of the cash machine.A card trap, is slid inside the real card slot so that when you finish using the machine, your card is swallowed and won’t come out of the ATM.Fraudsters will watch and wait until you leave the area, remove the trap from the slot and take your card.If you still can’t spot the camera…The camera is hidden in a fixture attached to the ATM (Picture: MPS Specials)The fraudsters have added a front on the card slot that works as a camera. It takes a while to spot.Action Fraud has guidelines on protecting yourself against cash machine fraud, which occurs when someone’s credit or debit card information is taken by fraudsters when they use an ATM machine.Check a cash machine every time you use one. Always cover the keypad when entering your PIN and don’t make it obvious which buttons you’re pressing.Spot the signsYou find a wobbly or bulky part that doesn’t seem to belong with the machine, such as a cover over the card slot or a loose keypad.How to report itMake sure you have your card issuer’s emergency number with you."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_10973881.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"david attenborough trends because everyone wants to wish him happy 92nd birthday","story":"Sir David Attenborough turns 92 years young today (Picture: PA)People have taken to Twitter to wish national treasure Sir David Attenborough a happy 92nd birthday.When #SirDavidAttenborough started trending online, many feared the worst, but were ‘relieved’ to discover it was his birthday.Many well-wishers took the opportunity to thank the English broadcaster and naturalist for his work and knowledge about the environment.DJ Mary Anne Hobbs wrote: ‘Happy birthday Sir David Attenborough.

You have to allow your intuition to guide you rather than rely on other people to tell you how to be yourself.’So with that in mind, and in the wake of the Gigi Hadid skin darkening debacle last week and Kanye continuing to be…Kayne, we sat down to talk about all things race, dating and self-love.As a black woman who has dark skin, I’ve always found it fascinating to see white people darken their skin because racism exists – racism is a dislike of dark-skinned people and racism festers in the system that we operate in. For white people to darken their skin to look like the people they suppress is a very interesting way to go about  life. I used to get quite annoyed by it but now I’m just so over it – in fact, it makes me more excited to be a black woman because I don’t have to spend money on UV beds or tanning products, I just have to put on some vaseline and I’m good.I often feel like if you’re a mixed person and you’re white passing, to an extent it does make sense to use that to your own benefit but again I’ve reached a point where I’ve just given up on feeling resentment towards people who allow themselves to live a better life because they’re on an advantage. To some degree, there’s always going to be people who act in a certain way and you just have to let it go. The people who hold the power have the responsibility to change the way that they allow the system to work I can either be frustrated about and let it ruin my day or just do my own thing.It’s an act of privilege in itself to be white and say that you’re black because regardless of whether you open your mouth or not, the world is still going to treat you as a white woman. But if I as a black woman with dark skin were to start saying, “oh, I’m white, I’ve always felt like I’m white”, no one is going to take me seriously – even if I do walk around believing that I’m white, the world will still respond to me as such because everything is ultimately about the darkness of our skins.I think Kayne’s a product of his environment and that doesn’t in any way justify the way in which he thinks – it’s really really sad for him to say something like slavery is a choice. Slavery isn’t just going up to someone and making them do something for you part of slavery involved raping women – rape isn’t a choice. Part of slavery involved women having babies ripped out of their arms and fed to alligators – I don’t think that was a choice.He has said that he doesn’t read so…the internet is giving so much attention to this man baby and it’d be nice if everyone could just let him fester in his own ignorance. He’s a danger to himself and it’s harrowing to see so many people agreeing with him or doing intellectual gymnastics to see where he’s coming from. You don’t always have to work to understand why people are saying harmful things – when he says that slavery is a choice, he’s essentially enabling white people to justify the belief that black people have a victim mentality which is completely untrue. I hope he gets the help he deserves.We saw that during the women’s march – with all the pink hats and armpit hair and vaginas. White feminism prioritises the topical issues, which are still very important, like body hair, reproductive rights, employment issues, wage gap but then I don’t see us talking enough about female genital mutilation, child brides, about the fact that misogyny has a very dangerous effect in Africa and the Middle East. It’s bad here in the west but it’s way worse in Africa where girls as young as nine are being made pregnant.If you want a movement to be effective, you have to prioritise the most marginalised. For me, white feminism just prioritises whiteness and creates racist results – if feminism was for all women, then I would be seeing white people at Black Lives Matter marches because black women exist and black women are dying at the hands of the state and black women are victims of gang violence and are victims of neighbourhoods that are underfunded. I don’t see any of that support and that’s part of the reason that I don’t identify as an intersectional feminist – I just identify as a feminist because as a black woman, my feminism is already intersectional.It prioritises issues that affect black people. If you want any kind of movement or new way of thinking to work, you’ve got to start with those who are most effective. I definitely do receive a lot of friction online whenever I say anything bold, tenacious or courageous because remember that black women are supposed to be seen and not heard. And that’s evident in the way that black women are represented, especially on social media.Most of the time when we do see black women in positions of glorification, they’re oiled up and super dark-skinned and wearing African print bikinis so there’s this heavy level of fetishisation. But the moment that black woman speaks up and says, “hey, I have a right to be heard and I’m not prepared to compromise for anyone”, she gets really attacked and pressured.I’m really big on black women specifically to stop sacrificing themselves for anybody because the world views us as this grandma whose always got this emotional toolbox ready to nurse you when you’ve got it wrong again. It’s such a harmful rhetoric we have to stop seeing black women as supernatural beings.What I Rent: Christie and Dom, £1,100 for a flat in LewishamMaternity photoshoot shows off pregnant mum\u0027s floral prosthetic leg It means that no one is looking out for or protecting them. So when a black woman does speak out and does so boldly, people often respond with knee-jerk reactions. You shouldn’t be that bold, that loud about it. I refuse to be silenced by the people who live better lives because they’re standing on my back. I don’t expect every black woman to do that because no one deserves to have to spend their lives dismantling a system that they didn’t build but I feel like I’m in a position where I can deliver that message and I’m not harmed by it because I can tap out – I’d love to be that person that black women can live vicariously through until they can speak out for themselves. I have that worry every single day and it’s annoying because you have the choice to either create the standards that you deserve or settle. A lot of women don’t realise that they’re settling because they don’t think beyond what they’ve been told they deserve. That means that they feel happy in oppressive relationships without even realising that they’re oppressive because not all oppressive behaviour is physically or verbally violent. It means that the more and more that I learn how insidious and visible misogyny can be, the more put off I become and the more disappointed I become that I’m straight. As a woman who is an intelligent feminist, it’d make sense for me to be attracted to women because it’d be a less oppressive relationship. Of course, women can have internalised misogynism and lesbian or bisexual relationships aren’t necessarily better than straight ones but it feels like as a straight woman, I am on the lookout for a man who is genuinely a feminist and not a fake one. There are a lot of men out there who say all the right language but their behaviour trips them up. I feel very bored with the concept of dating. I don’t even get excited about men who are feminists anymore because being a feminist should be the bare minimum. You should be fighting for a world that is safer for me because men need feminism too – we need to create a world where fragility and vulnerability is nurtured. Men need feminism but men also need to go and do the work on themselves a lot of the time it feels like men don’t know where to start and that’s not an excuse anymore. In 2018, if you know how to type in the name of your favourite social media page, you also know how to go to Google and type simple search terms like ‘how to stop being sad’, ‘local therapists near me’. If you can afford to be buying new trainers or subscribing to your favourite football channel, then you can also afford a therapist women are not therapists and relationships are not therapy. If men want to have more fruitful relationships and if we want the world to be a better place, men have to start prioritising their own healing so that both people can come into a relationship whole. Dating after orce: How to date as a single parentWoman 33 years younger than her partner shares how to make age-gap relationships workAbsolutely – I know men like that. He started out as someone who wasn’t necessarily the most respectful of women and he reached a point where he realised that the more he kept hurting women, the more he kept hurting himself. He had to go away and do the work…he saw it as his responsibility to be the most emotionally mature man he could be for himself. There are men out there who are doing the work on themselves but you have to want better for yourself and believe you deserve better.They were fat bloggers and where they were coming from was very valid they were expressing the fact that they feel the body positivity movement has been hijacked by slimmer women. Women who are a size 10-12 who might have a bit of a podgy belly are uploading pictures of them holding it in and pushing it out and sure, they’re making a statement…but it distracts from the fact that the larger your body is, the worse you’re treated by society.Fat women still deserve to have the loudest voice in the body positive movement because they created it.Regardless of your body size, your boobs can be saggy and I acknowledge the fact that I benefit from skinny privilege and I benefit from pretty privilege.I still do need to make sure that I put that message out there but I still have a responsibility to uplift and promote the plus size women who are within my reach. If I do see a fat woman who is talking about body positivity, I have to retweet her or talk about it on my Instagram stories – something to make sure that I’m lending my voice to her because I have the benefit of people listening to me rather than the fat women who actually started the movement. That’s how you utilise privilege, by using your voice to help others. What A Time To Be Alive is available on pre-order now from Amazon and is out 26 July 2018.MORE: ‘Netflix of fitness apps’: How Fiit could actually replace your gym membership"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_10973403.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"fans cant figure kylie jenner wearing band aid met ball just weird tan lines","story":"Too cute, we repeat, too cute.

(Picture: Alexander Crawley)Fancy having a look inside a bunch of people’s homes?But there’s a reason we’re taking you inside people’s rented houses in London, beyond wanting to see people’s cupboard organisation.The current renting situation is a nightmare. It’s tricky to know what’s a reasonable amount to pay each month, the majority of viewings you go on are dismal rooms with shoddy showers, and it’s hard to get a proper sense of what other people are getting for what they pay.So for What I Rent, we’re showing you around a different person’s rented property each week, to gradually bring us closer to a clearer picture of renting.This week we’re talking to Christie and Dom, who live in Lewisham.The couple pays £1,100 each month. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)First off: How much are you paying and what are you getting in return?We pay £1,100 between us and the flat came fully furnished – apart from the matching red kitchen stuff – we have my lovely nan to thank for those!When we were looking for places to move in we set our upper limit to £1,200 so when we found this for cheaper we were super happy.Dom used to live in a rank flatshare in Vauxhall where you came out of the shower feeling dirtier than when you went in, and he used to pay £600 for the room only. So moving here actually meant him saving money on his rent.Our place is one bedroom, one bathroom, and a big livingdiningkitchen area. We also have a little room for the washing machine and storage too.There’s a bedroom, a bathroom, and a living room and kitchen area. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)One of the only things we decided on when we were looking to move out was that we want one bedroom and definitely wouldn’t go for a studio.The thought of eating, sleeping, chilling, and doing whatever else in the same room makes me feel weird.And what about bills?I feel like we’ve never fully sat down and worked it out. I’d say probably around £100 a month?Luckily our flat is really warm so we rarely have to put the heating on.Whereabouts is the flat?Our flat is in Lewisham, down the insanely busy high street. Luckily our window looks out the back so it’s relatively quiet.It’s really handy being on the high street though because we’ve got loads of hangover-friendly food options in walking distance as well as the shopping centre and the station just a five minute walk away.Plus we live on top of a gym which I’ve just managed to rope Dom into joining under the guise of ‘when are we ever going to live on top of a 24-hour gym again?’It’s a really great location all round to be honest.The flat’s in Lewisham, which is pretty well connected. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)When we tell people we live in Lewisham everyone thinks it’s really far out but it’s actually in Zone 2.It takes 10 minutes to get to London Bridge by train and 20 minutes to Cannon Street, which was one of the first things we made sure of before we viewed the flat. Plus DLR links to Canary Wharf, Bank and Stratford.How did you find your flat?We found it on RightMove. We dedicated one Sunday afternoon at my parents to just hunting for potential flats with the view of arranging viewings for the following week. We viewed this one on the Tuesday and it was held off the market for us that evening.It was the first one we viewed but we knew we really liked it. We also knew that it was cheap for what it was and that there had been viewings before us too, so over a romantic dinner in what would be our new local spoons we decided to go for it.How long have you been there?We’ve lived here for just under a year, but have agreed that we’re going to sign the contract for another year.We have no real reason to move out. It’s a great location, it’s modern with huge windows, has great transport links.Plus we’d miss Tony the concierge if we left, he’s so friendly and always brings our parcels up to our front door for us.Christie admits the room could be a touch bigger, though. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)So you’re happy where you are, right?We’re really happy here – as I said before we have no real reason to move out.The building itself is a converted department store so has a lot of history and character behind it, despite the inside of the flat looking like every other modern flat in London.A lot of people think Lewisham is a e or a bit rough but I loved it as soon as we moved here.Lewisham itself is going under huge regeneration with new restaurants and bars popping up. Despite the regeneration there’s still a hugely multicultural feel – especially down Lewisham high street where there’s still the old school market.I reckon you can buy literally anything there – and it brings such a busy atmosphere especially on Saturday mornings.Plus there’s the Street Feast Model Market just at the other end of the high street which has some amazing food vendors and music.There are some really cool pubs too like the Fox and Firkin and Ladywell Tavern which both have really cool beer gardens and are both within walking distance.Plus if ever you get bored or want to explore somewhere near there’s New Cross, Deptford, Blackheath, Greenwich, and Peckham just down the road which are full of cool pubs, bars, and restaurants. Not to mention the amazing green spaces of Blackheath and Greenwich just 10 minutes from the hustle and bustle of Lewisham high street. It really is the best of both worlds.But having a bathtub is a nice bonus – plus a 24-hour gym in the building. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)Do you feel like you have enough space?While the flat is small I think it’s definitely enough space for us.In terms of storage space it’s a little tight but I think that’s just because we have a lot of stuff.We’ve had to resort to slinging things on top of the wardrobe or down the side of the drawers in the bedroom. You don’t even want to look under the bed… there are boxes and suitcases of shoes and clothes under there too.You two are a couple, so you don’t have to put up with any housemate awkwardness. Was moving in together a big decision?We met at uni and so spent a lot of time together there. After uni we were both in London although I was living at my parents (Uxbridge, Zone 6) and working near Heathrow airport so we only saw each other at weekends.My job was only maternity cover though and I wanted to be working in London so we kind of both agreed that when I got a new job we would look for somewhere to live.It was never really up for discussion we both just kind of knew it was the next step in our relationship.We’d already been together almost three years by the time we moved in so wasn’t particularly a risky move.And as a couple, they don’t have to worry about any housemate weirdness. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)This all sounds dreamy. Is there anything not so great about where you’re living?I wouldn’t say major issues but there’s some building work going on at the moment as they’re adding two extra floors to the building. So recently we’ve been greeted with loud drilling some mornings.Apart from that we’ve never had any issues with the flat itself, our landlord, or our agent which I feel is a rarity when you rent in London.The bedroom is verging on a little too small for us, and has a weird internal window that makes the room too dingy when you want it to be light and too light when you want it to be dark.Have you considered buying a place?We’ve definitely spoke about it but I think more in the sense of a distant possibility rather than something that’s going to happen soon. With such huge deposits required and such a high cost of living in London it’s just not achievable for us to start saving for a house deposit at the moment.We’re both still relatively young (23 and 24) so we’re happy renting for now.Plus, I think there’s definitely less importance around being a homeowner these days, especially in London.When we do eventually buy a house I think it would definitely be outside of London. Not only for the price but I’m really missing having a garden to sunbathe in!Now, let’s have a proper look around Christie and Dom’s flat…(Picture: Alexander Crawley)MORE: What I Rent: Miranda and George, £1,283 for a flat in HighgateMORE: What I Rent: Mel, £615 a month for a room in Newington Green"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/04/17/0F9648E700000514-5692025-image-a-111_1525450122839.jpg","title":"Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis net worth revealed","story":"    Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis has been hailed a hero after criticising Labour MP Chi Onwurah over student finance claims on BBC ’s Question TimeMartin has also attracted media attention after suing Facebook for publishing adverts using his image to promote scams and the virtual currency Bitcoin.This news came after the social media platform was grilled for sharing personal details of nearly 90 million people with Cambridge Analytica. But what is Martin Lewis’s net worth?Who is Martin Lewis?Born Martin Steven Lewis on May 9, 1972 in Withington, Manchester, he is an English financial journalist and founder of the website MoneySavingExpert.com.He lost his mother in a car accident at a young age and later in life, went on to become a patron of the children’s bereavement charity Grief Encounter as well as an advocate for life insurance.Martin studied government and law at the London School of Economics and went on to complete a postgraduate course in broadcast journalism in Cardiff.His first job was at a financial communications consultancy, the Brunswick Group in London and later, became a producer for the BBC Business Unit working on BBC Radio Five Live business programmes.Martin was also an editor of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme and then moved to Sky’s Simply Money where he formed his Money Saving Expert persona.After the collapse of Simply Money, he wrote for the Deal of the Week column in the Sunday Express and was then granted slots on Channel 5’s Open House with Gloria Hunniford.Martin returned to BBC for a short while before presenting a daytime television series on ITV in 2005 called Make Me Rich as well as Channel Five show It Pays to Watch.He then presented money saving programmes on Good Morning Britain and Lorraine and now appears on This Morning, The Wright Stuff and began presenting The Martin Lewis Money Show.Martin Lewis is married to former 5 News weather presenter Lara Lewington in May 31, 2009 and the couple had a daughter in November 2012.          Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis pictured with his Order of the British Empire (OBE) medal alongside his wife Lara Lewington at an Investiture ceremony in February 2015 at Buckingham PalaceMartin Lewis on Question TimeMoney Saving Expert Martin Lewis was applauded by Question Time viewers after he slammed Labour Party MP Chi Onwurah over student finance claims.He accused politicians of dissuading young people from attending university by referring to the fee payments as student ‘debt’ and said that an entire generation had been ‘mis-educated’.He said: \u0027It is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame... It\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Martin explained that the price of attending university was irrelevant and the repayments are based on salary, which means that those who earn a lot after completing their studies, will naturally have to pay back more.Ms Onwurah, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central said: \u0027If somebody, and particularly somebody from a working class background, if somebody has 57,000 in debt,\u0027 but Martin interrupted her to say: ‘Don\u0027t tell them! Politicians do this all the time. You can\u0027t make political points.\u0027You put off young people from underprivileged backgrounds from going to university with a fear of debt by framing it as a debt when you know it doesn\u0027t work like that.\u0027Politicians need to take responsibility. Your political football that you and all the parties have used student finance to be has mis-educated a generation about how student finance works and it is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame because there are people from poor backgrounds on television - I saw a programme two weeks ago - saying I can\u0027t afford to go to university.\u0027Well, you know what, it is expensive, it\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Ms Onwurah responded: \u0027It is really, really important to recognise that tuition fees are an obstacle for students going into university. It\u0027s psychological but a lot of the world is psychological. How things are perceived is what informs people\u0027s choice.\u0027You can argue to re-educate, or you can argue, as we have done, to abolish tuition fees.\u0027Martin Lewis suing FacebookIn April 2018, Money Saving Expert founder Martin Lewis revealed that he is in the process of suing Facebook for publishing dozens of adverts using his image to promote scams.He said that the social media platform had used his name to ‘rip off vulnerable people’. He continued: \u0027I feel sick each time I hear of another victim being conned because of trust they wrongly thought they were placing in me.‘I believe politicians have totally missed the impact of social media companies on real people and their pockets. It is about time they took this seriously.’Martin went on to say that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg ‘pretends to be an honest and campaigning man but his company is a facilitator of criminal scammers … They have known about these scam adverts for years, and they are still happy to roll around in their dirty money.’Facebook has been accused of publishing more than 50 fake Martin Lewis adverts, with the majority promoting schemes trading in Bitcoin, which Martin claimed were actually binary trading firms.Binary trading is a risky form of gambling on the stock market that sees most investors lose money.The Financial Conduct Authority has said almost 100 firms are illegally offering such investments to UK consumers and warned of online firms that take money, place no bets for customers then break contact.Martin has asked Facebook to remove the adverts multiple times but they are left up for days or weeks before being taken down and then reappear days later.A Facebook spokesman said: ‘We do not allow adverts which are misleading or false on Facebook and have explained to Martin Lewis he should report any adverts that infringe his rights and they will be removed.’Martin Lewis net worthMartin Lewis’s net worth has accumulated to approximately £73 million, according to Wealtholino.In 2012, BBC News reported that Martin sold MoneySavingExpert.com for up to £87 million.What is Elon Musk\u0026#8217s net worth?

She is said to be \u0027deeply unhappy\u0027 that she is not on the guest list for Harry and Meghan\u0027s second private evening wedding receptionThe Duchess of York is said to be ‘deeply unhappy’ after being left off the Royal Family’s ‘inner sanctum’ guest list for this month’s royal wedding.Prince Andrew’s ex-wife is among 600 guests invited to the ceremony in St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle on May 19 and to the reception that is being held afterwards in St George’s Hall, it can be confirmed.But while Andrew and their children, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, have also been sent coveted invitations for a second, private evening reception for 250 being thrown by Prince Charles for the couple, Sarah is most definitely off the guest list for that.According to sources, the 58-year-old duchess has been complaining about the ‘snub’ to anyone who will listen – even though many in the royal households think she should count herself lucky to be going at all. Prince Harry personally intervened to make sure she had an invitation to his wedding to Meghan Markle and the first reception after years in the royal wilderness.It is understood that Sarah has already been introduced to Meghan by Harry, who is close to his cousins Beatrice and Eugenie, but it is thought that Charles, who is paying for the evening reception at Frogmore House, doesn’t approve.An insider said: ‘Numbers are limited to the evening party, she is not a member of the Royal Family any more and Prince Charles simply doesn’t have time for her. \u0027He just can’t see why she is still such a big part of his brother’s life.’Prince Harry\u0027s bid to be first royal to serve on the...Meghan Markle\u0027s Suits co-stars enlist the help of the show\u0027s...Share this articleThe duchess wasn’t invited to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s 2011 wedding at Westminster Abbey, which was a much larger occasion than Harry and Meghan’s ‘intimate’ family ceremony, and took herself off to a spa in Thailand to lick her wounds.While relations have thawed enough in recent years for Sarah to be invited to a small number of occasions, such as Royal Ascot and the family’s summer sojourn at Balmoral, even the Queen has to take care that she doesn’t appear when Prince Philip is around.He is said to hold a deep-seated grudge against the duchess for the embarrassments he feels she has heaped upon his family over the years, once memorably describing her as ‘having no point’.    Meghan and Harry after announcing their engagement. It is understood that Sarah  has already been introduced to Meghan by HarryHe has never forgiven her for being photographed having her ‘toes sucked’ by a pool in the South of France by her ‘financial adviser’, John Bryan, in 1992, while still married to Andrew.She has also tried Philip’s patience with her profligate lifestyle, which has seen her come close to bankruptcy twice over the years, saved only by the generosity of her former husband.Although Philip has not been seen in public for several weeks while he recovers at Windsor from a hip replacement operation, it is hoped he will be well enough to make an appearance on his grandson’s big day, leaving many royal insiders speculating whether he will even acknowledge the duchess’s presence.          Prince Charles is throwing the second reception for Harry and Meghan. He reportedly doesn\u0027t want Sarah to attendOne source said: ‘It will be fascinating to see if the Duke of Edinburgh acknowledges her. \u0027He has held a grudge against her for a long, long time and normally refuses to even be in the same room as her.’Earlier this year the Daily Mail told how Sarah had been invited to the wedding, contrary to reports that she had been banned, but the situation had caused a ‘massive headache’ behind the scenes.Senior royals, led by Charles and Philip, had made no bones about the fact that they didn’t want the duchess there, but Harry, who is fond of her, held his ground.He has kept in touch with his aunt over the years, and has previously holidayed at the Swiss ski chalet she bought for an estimated £13million a few years ago with her former husband. ‘He absolutely, 100 per cent wants her there and has told palace officials that in no uncertain terms,’ a source said.Despite their 1996 orce, Sarah and Andrew remain extremely close and live at Royal Lodge, his Windsor home, together. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/23/4BED49A700000578-0-image-m-20_1525646031347.jpg","title":"Archbishop Canterbury takes inspiration Stormzy preparing Harry Meghans wedding","story":"    The Archbishop of Canterbury is taking inspiration from a Stormzy song to prepare for officiating the royal wedding.

One of the year\u0027s first harvests had been planned for this weekend.\u0027If we lose our farm, we don\u0027t know where we\u0027re going to go. You lose your income and you lose your home at the same time,\u0027 said McArthur, who\u0027s had the farm for about 20 years. \u0027All you can do is pray and hope and try to get all the information you can.\u0027About 250 people and 90 pets spent Saturday night at shelters, the American Red Cross said.The number of lava-venting fissures in the neighborhood grew overnight from eight to as many as 10, Stovall said, though some have quieted at various points. Regardless, USGS scientists expect fissures to keep spewing.The lava could eventually be channeled to one powerful vent while others go dormant, as has happened in some previous Hawaii eruptions, Stovall said.Kilauea, one of the world\u0027s most active volcanoes, has been erupting continuously since 1983.The USGS\u0027s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory issued a notice in mid-April that there were signs of pressure building in underground magma, and a new vent could form on the cone or along what\u0027s known as the East Rift Zone. Leilani Estates sits along the zone.    Numerous vents, each several hundred yards long, have opened in the neighborhood since Thursday following the volcano eruption          Scientists said Kilauea was likely to release more lava through additional vents, but they were unable to predict exactly whereThe crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering earthquakes and pushing lava into new underground chambers that carried it toward Leilani Estates and nearby communities. A magnitude-6.9 earthquake - Hawaii\u0027s largest in more than 40 years - hit the area Friday.It set Michael McGuire\u0027s car rocking in his driveway, knocking things off his shelves and shattering glass in his cabinets near Leilani Estates.He hoped to check on his home Sunday but realized it was too soon to be sure when, or if, it would be safe from the moving lava.\u0027I\u0027m somewhat fatalistic: if it happens, it happens,\u0027 he said. \u0027And I\u0027m enjoying life here, so you know, you put up with a lot of things here.

Seth-Smith assumed she would become a nurse. It was only later, while at her small comprehensive school in Cumbria, she realised she might be able to become a doctor‘My mum was a nurse and my dad was a doctor, so I was always very interested in medical stuff.\u0027I used to have a permanent hospital for my dolls and teddies set up in my bedroom, where I would do ward rounds, check their

doctors?”‘Men were doctors and women were nurses, and that was absolutely how it felt then.’But a seed had been planted and Sally, who settled in Hampshire, has now been a GP for 30 years. YouTube stars are trading in children\u0027s sexual misery by...Mother warns over shocking new playground craze The...Share this articleTwo of her children are also doctors, and her youngest son works in finance. She has two grandchildren. Sally smiles as she reads back her childhood dreams of a world where 2,000 people live on the moon, ‘England is like Switzerland with no fighting’, ‘the Russians no longer invade other countries’ and ‘the whole world is running out of food’.‘It is just so me socially, politically and ecologically aware — a lot of what I’m passionate about now, but I had no idea I had that sort of understanding or thoughts when I was 11,’ she says.But as eloquent as her essay is, Sally’s recollections of that time are tinged with sadness.Not long after she’d written her essay, Sally’s mother committed suicide. She had discovered that her husband was having an affair with one of her friends. Sally and her three younger brothers were almost immediately uprooted and taken to Cumbria by their father, who never discussed their mother’s death.It was only later that they began to piece together what had happened in their parents’ lives. ‘I was probably well into my mid-20s before I could really talk about it,’ says Sally, who has been married to her second husband Nigel, an electronics engineer, for nearly 20 years.    I still regret money woes killed off my ideal career Jackie Adkins laughs as she re-reads the three paragraphs that constituted her idea of an ‘essay’.‘I work in a hair dressers and looking for a shop (sic) when I have saved up some money I will buy one,’ she wrote. Cinema trips with friends and buying clothes on a Saturday — those were Jackie’s dreams.  Cinema trips with friends and buying clothes on a Saturday — those were Jackie Adkins\u0027 dreams. Today, she has been married to Paul, 63, for 35 years and has three children and one grandsonToday, she has been married to Paul, 63, for 35 years and has three children and one grandson. She wonders whether she wrote so little because she was so certain where she would be at 25.‘I was always going to be a hairdresser,’ says Jackie. ‘I used to cut my own hair and my mum’s and I used to carry my hairdressing scissors in my school bag and at lunchtime the girls would say “can you do my fringe for me?” or “can you put layers in my hair?”’Jackie loved her secondary school in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, one of the brand-new comprehensives, and was among the first year to start when it opened in 1969.She had a place to study at hairdressing college when, aged 16, her parents moved to Sussex, and her dreams were shelved. She found herself working in a bank because her parents could not afford to support her through college.Her father had a heart attack and died when Jackie was just 19, so her income was even more essential and thoughts of going to hairdressing college faded.She remains wistful about the career that might have been — she still cuts her grown-up children’s hair and one of her daughters is a hairdresser — but Jackie says: ‘Once I got into the cycle of earning money, it was so hard to break away from that.’Jackie left banking after the birth of her second child and since then has done everything from selling candles to catering for parties and working for a mining recruitment company.But today, after surgery for a benign tumour in her stomach, Jackie is ‘enjoying taking life a little slower’, while helping her builder husband with his books from their home in Lancing, West Sussex.‘It’s time to do the things we couldn’t do when the kids were younger,’ she says. ‘I’m off to Amsterdam soon, going to do a Scandinavian boat tour in the summer and next year we are hoping to go to Cuba.’  All I knew was that I didn\u0027t want to be like my father Looking back, Steve Christmas is all too aware of the poignancy of his essay.Writing about his grown-up life, he predicted he would be a ‘sargant’ (sic) in the police with a wife named Jane, a new surname (Stephensone), a house in Wales and four children.The new surname and life in Wales were, he suspects, because he wanted to get as far away as possible from Harwich, Essex, where his parents ran a café and sweet shop.  Steve Christmas\u0027 father was an alcoholic who could put away a bottle of whisky a day and was verbally abusive to his wife and two sons. He promised himself he wouldn\u0027t ever be like himSteve’s father was an alcoholic who could put away a bottle of whisky a day and was verbally abusive to his wife and two sons.‘I didn’t want to be me,’ says Steve, who now lives in Eastbourne with wife Sue, 57, a PA for the NHS, whom he met on holiday aged 21. ‘I wanted to be this other person.’School was also miserable for Steve. ‘I wasn’t very clever,’ he says. ‘There was too much else going on in my life. I think today someone would have noticed.’He left school with no qualifications aged 15, and moved with his family to Rye, East Sussex, where he worked as a farm labourer, until his father went bankrupt and uprooted them all again to nearby Hastings. ‘I remember making a conscious decision that I wasn’t going to be like my father,’ he says.Steve didn’t become a policeman — he realised before leaving school that at 5ft 9in he wasn’t tall enough and that he would struggle to pass the exams he needed.Instead, several years later, he started working for an insurance company, and studied at night to pass his vocational exams, discovering he was actually quite bright after all.Fatherhood came late for Steve. After leaving home at 31 to marry Sue, they eventually had daughter Emma, now 23, through IVF, thanks to Professor Robert Winston. ‘All I wanted when I was 11 was structure, to be happy, have children and for them to be happy, and that’s what has happened,’ smiles Steve, who took early retirement before setting up his own business writing wills.As for his father, he died in 2003, a year after Steve’s mother.‘That last year I learned a lot about him,’ says Steve. ‘I stopped him drinking so much, stopped him smoking. Before he died he gave me a big cuddle, which he had never done, he apologised and said: “I’m really sorry for what I’ve done.” \u0027Life’s too short to stay bitter. What happens in your childhood doesn’t have to hold you back.’  My dream was dashed but I still feel like that little boyNigel Wakeford was a clever child who passed his 11-plus and became the first boy in his family to go to grammar school.His was a happy childhood with his three siblings and parents. ‘My dad married at 18 and was working class. He did lots of different things, and ended up doing admin for a bus company,’ recalls Nigel.   Nigel Wakeford was a clever child who passed his 11-plus and became the first boy in his family to go to grammar school. He dreamed of being a soldier but failed the medical because he had a lazy eye‘But if he had ten bob in his pocket he’d take us out on the weekend.’ There were sailing trips, horseriding and countryside jaunts.Aged 11, Nigel dreamed of being a soldier. Visualising life at 25 he wrote: ‘I do not spend much time at home because I travel a lot abroad. At the moment I have a job as corpral (sic) in the army. \u0027There is a lot of drill and hard work in it but we do have some pleasure time we go to the pictures and have dances.’Sadly, Nigel’s dreams of joining the Armed Forces were not to be.Leaving school at 16, he did attempt to join the RAF. ‘I went to the recruitment office in Brighton and did all the exams. \u0027I was told I had one of the best English comprehension test papers they’d ever had, but then I went for the medical and failed because I had a minor eye defect, a “lazy” eye.’Naturally optimistic, he is not regretful but feels he missed out on a ‘career’. While clever enough to get his English and Maths O-levels a year early, he spent much of his working life in different jobs, before becoming a carpenter.Now semi-retired, but looking for a part-time job, he is mortgage free and enjoying life near Lewes, East Sussex, with his wife Caroline, a civil servant.His hobby is classic cars — and he’s been an MG Owners Club member for 35 years.‘I’d be a rich man if it wasn’t for cars and bikes,’ he jokes. ‘I still feel much younger than I am, I’ve never lost that. Mentally I’m still 12.’  I was bored with the workday grind even then! Aged 11, Paul Hoggins imagined life as a lawyer who has already fallen out of love with his job.He wrote: ‘The alarm clock goes for the start of another day. Another day of work at the office. How boring all I do is sit reading books . . . Why couldn’t I be a miner instead of a lawjer (sic) (who doesn’t do a thing).’In the event, he became a journalist, and while he doesn’t remember his childhood ambitions, he recognises his love of language and sardonic outlook in the essay.  Aged 11, Paul Hoggins imagined life as a lawyer who has already fallen out of love with his job. But he went on to become a journalist and remembers his love of language as a child‘My wife saw it and laughed and said that explains a lot,’ says Paul, a father-of-three who has four grandchildren. ‘For an 11-year-old there’s quite a dose of cynicism in there. And I always enjoyed creative writing and English.’Paul grew up on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, living with his four siblings, his mum’s younger half brother and his parents — eight of them squeezed into a three-bedroom council house while his dad worked for Pilkington, the glass manufacturer.‘I think I got my dad’s graft and my mum’s brightness. In a different time she would have gone to university, but she was a full-time mum until we all got older,’ says Paul. He took a degree in business studies but, as soon as he finished, he followed his older brother to work on a local newspaper.‘Before my degree, I never had it in my head that I would become a reporter,’ he says. ‘But when a junior reporter’s job came up on the local paper, I never looked back.’Paul, who confesses he has had a rewarding working life, still lives on Sheppey, with fitness instructor wife Amanda and works part-time at the Daily Mail. One son has followed in his father’s footsteps, one is a carpenter and the third has learning difficulties and lives in a nearby care home."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/07/23/4BF3F34300000578-0-image-a-9_1525731672349.jpg","title":"RICHARD LITTLEJOHN time Nonce Finder General dock","story":"    When he\u0027s not trying to shackle our free Press, or cosying up to the odious Max Mosley — from whom he has accepted £540,000 in donations — Tom Watson can be found pursuing a deranged vendetta against senior Tories he accuses of sex crimes. In a harrowing interview in Saturday\u0027s Mail, Sue Reid spoke to a young couple caught up in the madness who were threatened with the prospect of their baby daughter being taken away from them.Their only \u0027crime\u0027 was to live in a two-bedroom flat in the same building as ex-Conservative MP Harvey Proctor, who was wrongly accused of three counts of murder, child sex abuse and male rape.In February 2015, police and social services turned up at the property, on the Duke of Rutland\u0027s estate in Leicestershire, and ordered Adam and Charlotte Coxon to move out immediately.MasterChef contestant Aldo Ortado is revealed as a...Madonna, Cindy Crawford and Katharine McPhee get ready for...DJ Simon Mayo who earns £400,000 a year believes BBC...Met Gala 2018: Heavenly bodies!

But our commission shows how Britain can rise to this challenge.\u0027From an NHS levy to put healthcare on a firmer financial footing, to building more homes and a Citizen\u0027s Inheritance to boost young people\u0027s career and housing aspirations, our report shows how a new contract between generations can build a better and more unified Britain.\u0027The commission was chaired by the peer alongside Frances O\u0027Grady, TUC general secretary, and Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general.It also called for an \u0027NHS levy\u0027 funded by national insurance on the earnings of workers over the state pension age as well as on some occupational pension income.It comes after reports that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is considering putting forward proposals echoing the recommendation, a measure.  Theresa May (pictured in Downing Street today) was warned that the think-tank\u0027s plans would be unpopular with votersCouncil tax should be abolished and a property tax introduced in its place that would include surcharges on second and empty homes but stamp duty would be halved to encourage people to move, under the report\u0027s plan.  Ms Fairbairn said: \u0027The idea that each generation should have a better life than the previous one is central to the pursuit of economic growth. The fact that it has broken down for young people should therefore concern us all.\u0027We need iniduals, businesses and the state to pull together to address this challenge, and lift the living standards of young and future generations.\u0027The commission also makes a series of other recommendations, including improving employment security, a £1 billion \u0027better jobs deal\u0027 to help struggling young people get into work and bolstered rights for renters.It found millennials, people born between 1981 and 2000, are earning the same as those born 15 years before them were at the same age and are only half as likely to own their home by age 30 as baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1965, were. Give millennials £10,000 each to tackle generation gap, says thinktank | Money | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Saudi says lift driving ban women June 24","story":"    Get on the road: A Saudi woman receives a driving lesson from an Italian instructor in Jeddah, as the government announces that the ban will be lifted on June 24\u0027All the requirements for women in the kingdom to start driving have been established,\u0027 General Department of Traffic Director General Mohammed al-Bassami said in a statement today. Some of the instructors at the female-only driving schools will be women who have obtained their licenses abroad, al-Bassami said.This could help tackle several issues raised in recent months, including women fearing that conservative male driving instructors would fail them on purpose.It also helps bypass the rule that Saudi women are not allowed to have any interaction a man who she is not related to without permission from a male guardian. Women with foreign driving licenses will be able to apply for a local one through a separate process, which will also assess their driving skills.\u0027It is no secret that many women in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia hold driving licences from abroad,\u0027 the statement added.

She has been cut open from throat to pelvis, the baby exposed in her belly.Despite knowledge of a large number of babies born at Unit 731, there are no accounts of any survivors - including children.           Unit of torture: The senior officers of Unit 731 are pictured during World War II          Chinese adults and children have been infected with an unknown illness and are being monitored by Japanese medical staff at Unit 731 Some of those at Unit 731 died in experiments testing weapons such as grenades and biological bombs. Others are said to have been buried alive or drowned. As well as the 3,000  killed  at Unit 731, tens of thousands are also thought to have died when the Japanese used what they had learned against their enemies in the war - mainly Chinese civilians.In addition to releasing plague-infected fleas, the Japanese are known to have planted typhoid fever, cholera and other diseases into the water systems in Chinese villages.          Evil: The head of Unit 731, Shirō Ishii, who was awarded immunity by the US after the warDespite thousands of victims, the Japanese government denied the existence of the unit until 1998, when the Supreme Court indirectly acknowledged it by ruling there was an academic consensus that Unit 731 existed. The man largely responsible for the operation of Unit 731, Shirō Ishii, escaped punishment after the war.Ishii, and several others from Unit 731, were granted immunity by the United States in exchange for full disclosure of the results of their biological warfare experiments.Ishii died of throat cancer in Tokyo, Japan, in 1959, aged 67.The Soviet Union did hold trials for eleven of the scientist working at Unit 731 at the end of the war.They each  received between two and 25 years in a Siberian labour camp.Last month, a group of Japanese scholars announced that they are is set to publish a list of 3,607 members of Unit 731, including 52 surgeons, 49 engineers, 38 nurses and 1,117 combat medics. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/03/4BF5838C00000578-0-image-a-5_1525746233786.jpg","title":"Extraordinary snaps joyful Meghan Markle Italian holiday date Prince Harry","story":"    Meghan\u0027s unofficial wedding planner and best friend Jessica Mulroney posted this picture on Instagram in August 2016 – a month after Meghan had her first date with Harry.

She wore a coat by Canadian designer Sentaler and people went crazy for it. We had created this media frenzy, like you see with anything Kate wears.\u0027But it was only after Meghan began dating Prince Harry in 2016 that Mulroney became a global name. It was in her house that the couple sought refuge when news of their relationship broke.Then, last September, as speculation of an engagement reached fever pitch, Mulroney was in a box with Meghan, her mother Doria, and Markus Anderson, for the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games.Harry joined them for the final 20 minutes of the show, standing arm in arm with Meghan and planting a kiss on her check as they watched Bryan Adams sing love songs.And, when Harry and Meghan got engaged last November, Mulroney was credited with orchestrating the outfit – a white wrap coat by The Line, PAROSH green dress and Aquazzura nude pumps.She is also believed to be the brains behind Meghan\u0027s outfits for many of her official engagements and is instrumental in helping her choose her wedding dress.

Mulroney jetted into Heathrow for a \u0027mini hen party\u0027 and was given a sneak preview of the dress and the wedding venue.She has been so successful in helping Meghan create her \u0027effortless chic\u0027 style that Vogue, editor Edward Enninful believes she could eclipse the Duchess of Cambridge. \u0027Ms Markle is an astonishing fashion sales force, who is setting the industry alight,\u0027 he said recently.A royal source said: \u0027Jessica is Meghan\u0027s BFF (best friend forever) and has been a huge influence. Meghan\u0027s turned to her for advice on everything from the dress, the flowers, decorations in church, the wedding lunch — and even the seating plan. \u0027Although Jess lives in Toronto, the two are on the phone all the time.

The fact that it has broken down for young people should therefore concern us all.\u0027We need iniduals, businesses and the state to pull together to address this challenge, and lift the living standards of young and future generations.\u0027The commission also makes a series of other recommendations, including improving employment security, a £1 billion \u0027better jobs deal\u0027 to help struggling young people get into work and bolstered rights for renters.It found millennials, people born between 1981 and 2000, are earning the same as those born 15 years before them were at the same age and are only half as likely to own their home by age 30 as baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1965, were. Give millennials £10,000 each to tackle generation gap, says thinktank | Money | The Guardian"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/10/4BF81F4A00000578-5703017-Bogdan_Dochev_second_from_right_who_died_in_his_home_country_of_-a-1_1525773318101.jpg","title":"Linesman tormented decision let Maradona away Hand God goal","story":"    The linesman who let Maradona get away with his \u0027Hand of God\u0027 goal (pictured) against England was tormented by his decision until his death, his wife has revealed          Bogdan Dochev (second from right), who died in his home country of Bulgaria last year, admitted in 2014 that he had seen the Argentine punch the ball beyond England goalkeeper Peter Shilton (right, shaking hands with Maradona ahead of the 1986 World Cup quarter-final clash)After hoodwinking officials with his first handball effort, the attacking wizard dribbled past five England players in a brilliant solo effort.Following the handball, TV images showed Tunisian referee Bin Nasser running slowly backwards towards the centre of the pitch and looking at Dochev.

She has been cut open from throat to pelvis, the baby exposed in her belly.Despite knowledge of a large number of babies born at Unit 731, there are no accounts of any survivors - including children.           Unit of torture: The senior officers of Unit 731 are pictured during World War II          Chinese adults and children have been infected with an unknown illness and are being monitored by Japanese medical staff at Unit 731 Some of those at Unit 731 died in experiments testing weapons such as grenades and biological bombs. Others are said to have been buried alive or drowned. As well as the 3,000  killed  at Unit 731, tens of thousands are also thought to have died when the Japanese used what they had learned against their enemies in the war - mainly Chinese civilians.In addition to releasing plague-infected fleas, the Japanese are known to have planted typhoid fever, cholera and other diseases into the water systems in Chinese villages.          Evil: The head of Unit 731, Shirō Ishii, who was awarded immunity by the US after the warDespite thousands of victims, the Japanese government denied the existence of the unit until 1998, when the Supreme Court indirectly acknowledged it by ruling there was an academic consensus that Unit 731 existed. The man largely responsible for the operation of Unit 731, Shirō Ishii, escaped punishment after the war.Ishii, and several others from Unit 731, were granted immunity by the United States in exchange for full disclosure of the results of their biological warfare experiments.Ishii died of throat cancer in Tokyo, Japan, in 1959, aged 67.The Soviet Union did hold trials for eleven of the scientist working at Unit 731 at the end of the war.They each  received between two and 25 years in a Siberian labour camp.Last month, a group of Japanese scholars announced that they are is set to publish a list of 3,607 members of Unit 731, including 52 surgeons, 49 engineers, 38 nurses and 1,117 combat medics. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/10/4BF8162C00000578-5701907-image-a-71_1525771875714.jpg","title":"The Great Bank Holiday clear Parks beaches Britain left strewn litter","story":"    Huge amounts of litter were left behind by people after the bank holiday weekend on Southend seafront in Essex          Plastic rubbish, nappies, windbreakers and disposable barbecues were left littering the country\u0027s coastline and green spaces by visitors basked in temperatures hit 84F (28.7C), making the parts of the UK hotter than Hawaii.

She then launched her own business importing luxury lingerie.After a successful career as a stylist – with her own TV slot – and wedding planner, she was propelled to the A list in 2008 after marrying the eldest son of Brian Mulroney.The couple has three children: twins Brian and John, now seven, and daughter Ivy now four, who are rumoured to be page boys and flower girl at the Royal wedding.

She wore a coat by Canadian designer Sentaler and people went crazy for it. We had created this media frenzy, like you see with anything Kate wears.\u0027But it was only after Meghan began dating Prince Harry in 2016 that Mulroney became a global name. It was in her house that the couple sought refuge when news of their relationship broke.Then, last September, as speculation of an engagement reached fever pitch, Mulroney was in a box with Meghan, her mother Doria, and Markus Anderson, for the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games.Harry joined them for the final 20 minutes of the show, standing arm in arm with Meghan and planting a kiss on her check as they watched Bryan Adams sing love songs.And, when Harry and Meghan got engaged last November, Mulroney was credited with orchestrating the outfit – a white wrap coat by The Line, PAROSH green dress and Aquazzura nude pumps.She is also believed to be the brains behind Meghan\u0027s outfits for many of her official engagements and is instrumental in helping her choose her wedding dress.

Mulroney jetted into Heathrow for a \u0027mini hen party\u0027 and was given a sneak preview of the dress and the wedding venue.She has been so successful in helping Meghan create her \u0027effortless chic\u0027 style that Vogue, editor Edward Enninful believes she could eclipse the Duchess of Cambridge. \u0027Ms Markle is an astonishing fashion sales force, who is setting the industry alight,\u0027 he said recently.A royal source said: \u0027Jessica is Meghan\u0027s BFF (best friend forever) and has been a huge influence. Meghan\u0027s turned to her for advice on everything from the dress, the flowers, decorations in church, the wedding lunch — and even the seating plan. \u0027Although Jess lives in Toronto, the two are on the phone all the time.

But will anyone else move in?Billboards promising another way of life have long clustered alongside the clogged highways of central Cairo. Advertisements for gated housing developments called “Regent’s Park”, “Beta Greens” or “Uptown” promise “360-degree greenery” and open spaces. One, on a busy and polluted central road, invites onlookers to “just breathe”.The promise of escape from the congestion of central Cairo to a new life 40km away on the city’s outskirts is fetishised for those able to afford it. Nowhere is this more clear than on the billboards advertising real estate in “Entrada”, a housing and commercial property development in Egypt’s new administrative capital, which is currently without a name. “Welcome to a supreme community,” proclaims one. The development is touted by its creators as “the entrance to a new city, a new lifestyle, a new community and a new worldwide centre of attraction”.The alternative capital will  700 sq km, making it almost as large as Singapore, and is intended to house a total of five million people. The plan shows an expanse of high-rises and residential buildings as well as a “government district” all stationed around a central “green river”, a combination of open water and planted greenery twice the size of New York’s Central Park.The project is designed to wipe clean the problems of Cairo, and build a glistening new future. Most government buildings, as well as those occupied by the Egyptian president, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, are scheduled to move there in June 2019. Foreign embassies are also encouraged to relocate, and businesses will be lured to a central business district of 20 Chinese-built skyscrapers. But what will happen to the old city once the new capital takes root?If the government’s plans are successful, the move will leave behind a network of empty buildings, all owned by the same umbrella company as the new capital, and for which there is currently no plan. For the government, the new administrative capital represents a fresh start – but one that will draw wealth from the existing capital.During a visit to the site last October, journalists were invited to view the construction of Egypt’s largest church, a new cabinet building, and stood looking at a stagnant future ornamental pool as a pair of fighter jets conducted a ceremonial flyover. Pictures of Entrada show spacious villas next to snaking pools of water and advertise their proximity to the development’s 4km of theme parks and so-called natural terrain. A two-bedroom apartment – with “a view of water”, private gardens and a maids’ room – is listed for around £45,000. The spokesman for the project, Khaled El-Husseiny, resisted questions about the quantity of affordable housing available in the new capital and the average price of real estate. “Forget the numbers, they’re not important and not fixed,” he said, frustrated. “We have a dream, and we’re building our dreams now.”“For example, the ministry of housing owns a building or many buildings in downtown Cairo,” he says. “I will give a new ministry building here, a smart and connected one, air-conditioned and up to date, and we at ACUD will take the old one. We are establishing a new company just to control all the buildings that we will receive from all the ministries.” The future of the many buildings that make up Egypt’s sprawling state infrastructure, mostly situated on prime real estate in central Cairo, remains uncertain. “We have no plan as to how to invest in these buildings, but we will fix it and figure it out,” says El-Husseiny. “Maybe we can make them into hotels.” Profits from these vacated buildings will then feed back into the ACUD. But it is also unclear just how much money is being sunk into the new administrative capital. It was given an initial estimated cost of £30bn in 2015.“There is no total budget,” says El-Husseiny. “It’s a big one, a great one, but we must also calculate the cost of building infrastructure.” He adds that the ACUD was founded with a cash injection of 204bn EGP (£8.5bn) from the ministry of defence and the ministry of housing, but emphasises that the project will continue without further government assistance.There are two kinds of budget, he says: “The budget according to the documents and the actual budget they have to pay.” He says the ACUD has already repaid 20bn EGP to the banks, although the source of these funds is unclear, as is who will ultimately pay for the rest of the sparkling buildings shown in the plans.El-Husseiny stresses the budget for the new capital will be settled on a “case by case basis” as each part is constructed. The governmental district, for example, will cost 40bn EGP. – By way of comparison, Egypt accepted a $12bn (£8.8bn) emergency loan from the International Monetary Fund in 2016.The new capital will also draw on Cairo’s much-needed resources. Two water stations will pump an estimated 200,000 cubic metres of water per day, siphoning water from nearby satellite cities. Once the project is completed it will use an estimated 1.5m cubic metres of water per day. “In Brazil it was Rio and it became Brasília – we need this. It costs billions, we know, but we need it,” says El-Husseiny, referencing Oscar Niemeyer and Lúcio Costa’s landmark project to build a new capital in Brazil, now regarded as a symbol of the failure of urban planning and inequality. It is hoped Egypt’s new capital will house almost twice the population of Brasília, while paradoxically appealing to incomers as a way to escape Cairo’s crowded street life. There is no doubt that Cairo’s rapidly expanding population desperately needs housing. The number of inhabitants grew by half a million in 2017, making it the world’s fastest-growing city. Greater Cairo, now a megalopolis, housed 22.9 million people as of mid-2016 and is projected to contain 40 million by 2050. But the city is already ringed by a large collection of half-empty planned towns, each a failed monument to their developers’ inability to draw the bulk of the population away from downtown Cairo. Workers unable to afford to move to the new capital may be able to use the proposed electric train and monorail to get to work, but there are no guarantees that these will be competitively priced either. “In order for the new capital to succeed, if the goal is to reduce congestion, it doesn’t come simply by moving a few thousand employees,” says Elshahed. “Most government employees don’t own private cars, so it’s not like it’s them congesting downtown Cairo.”El-Husseiny, however, is determined that his vision alone will entice enough new residents, including foreign embassies and those working there. “We will give them benefits not available in the old Cairo, wide streets and a smart city,” he says, going on to outline something quite dystopian: “A smart city means a safe city, with cameras and sensors everywhere. There will be a command centre to control the entire city.” A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Cairo says that while the Egyptian government has located space for embassies, they are currently “assessing the move”. Other embassies contacted by  Cities were hesitant, but unwilling to discuss this publicly. “Cairo isn’t suitable for the Egyptian people,” says El-Husseiny. “There are traffic jams on every street, the infrastructure can’t support the population, and it’s very crowded. Without any specific masterplan, it has started to become ugly … there’s no humanity.”There is no doubt that Cairo’s congestion makes residents fantasise about escape, although wide streets, double-glazed windows, open water and pruned topiary seem more like the dreams of suburban London or Chicago than ideas well-adapted to the desert plain. But El-Husseiny is adamant. “We need a landmark, a new capital. We have the right to have a dream and this is our dream.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d36c496de0ebcc955bc52850ee1801e6f6714c28/0_194_3279_1967/master/3279.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f96f29092c1be5c8ee7846370c762844","title":"super basement london housing market foreign wealth inflation property","story":"“I don’t want to expel any oligarchs. Their cranes are sprouting across the city, and it’s marvellous,” Boris Johnson said when he was mayor of London. The cranes were not just building the ubiquitous luxury apartment towers defining the city they were also digging down, tunnelling underneath the most expensive streets to create multiple storey basements housing swimming pools, cinemas and even an artificial beach with a cascading waterfall.There is an argument that the concentration of billionaires in certain areas of the capital has had little impact on the housing crisis and is in fact positive, providing jobs and services and stimulating certain parts of the economy. But this is not the main impact: instead, the glut of foreign capital creates soaring inflation, distorting the housing market and raising property prices and rents throughout the city.This happens through a process of “trickle-down”. Wealth does indeed trickle down, but instead of benefiting the less well-off, as free marketeers claimed it would, it displaces them. This is true for the old English elites who can no longer afford to live in Kensington and Chelsea, and for the residents of social housing forced out of their homes as estates are demolished and luxury apartments go up in their place.Researchers at Savills, the property company, identified this trend as far back as 2011. In a report, The Champagne Tower Effect, Savills wrote positively: “As billionaires displace multimillionaires from the top addresses, so they in turn displace millionaires … equity migrates to more peripheral areas of the capital and, eventually, out of the capital to the rest of the UK.”If your neighbourhood has been affected by basement developments, or you own one or have been involved in their construction, and have experienced any of the issues in this story or similar, we would like to hear from you.

You can read terms of service\u0026nbsphere.As the English upper classes sell up in Kensington and Chelsea, they buy their children homes in once unfashionable places on the outreaches of the capital, which become property hotspots. In turn, middle-class families unable to afford their fast gentrifying areas are pushed out to cities like Bristol or south coast towns from Hastings to Margate, which are becoming a mix of priced-out London artists and creatives alongside a large homeless population in temporary accommodation.So the extreme wealth of the basement billionaires is directly linked to plummeting levels of home ownership, high rents and poor conditions.The study into luxury basements by Roger Burrows and researchers at Newcastle University’s Global Urban Research Unit, reported by the , found that more than 4,600 basements had been built in London in the last decade – and it is important because it becomes impossible to dismiss the trend as anecdotal evidence and the preserve of a statistically insignificant handful. One street in Chelsea boasts 22 approved basements, including 12 swimming pools and five cinemas. Six are described as “large”, which means at least three storeys deep.Many of the most opulent basements are to be found in the shadow of the charred hulk of Grenfell Tower, just a few minutes walk away. In Benjamin Disraeli’s novel Sybil, written in 1845, he described “Two nations between whom there is no intercourse and no sympathy who are as ignorant of each other’s habits, thoughts, and feelings, as if they were dwellers in different zones or inhabitants of different planets.” The stark inequalities found in British cities ensure that Disraeli’s words continue to have contemporary resonance. Today, at the other end of the income scale to the owners of the super basements, some people are enduring subterranean living conditions of a very different kind – paying a high proportion of their low pay for glorified cellars, in damp, poorly ventilated rooms with no natural light. In one instance in 2015 a landlord in north London was forced to pay back £70,000 in rent for letting out “unsatisfactory and substandard” accommodation, with seven people living in one cellar.The gulf between the lifestyles of the super-rich and the rest of us is vast. Grenfell wasn’t just a home for the poorest and most deprived living in ghettoised tower blocks. It was a mixed community of people in many occupations and from a variety of places, fighting poor housing conditions that they had repeatedly warned against, in the face of a lack of accountability that meant their voices went unheard. As well as safety standards, when the Grenfell disaster struck, local groups were also in the midst of campaigning against regeneration plans for the area which included the demolition of estates and the leasing of North Kensington library to a private school.These economic processes, which some refer to as gentrification and others call social cleansing, are taking place throughout London and other British cities. They are the consequence of very large injections of unregulated foreign investment, in tandem with local authority-led regeneration strategies. Because the UK offers one of the most lax regulatory environments in the world, super-rich property owners can safely hide behind anonymous shell companies of dubious if not corrupt provenance – and many never occupy their luxury apartments or their gargantuan subterranean mansions.It is difficult to argue that the presence of such large concentrations of extreme wealth is beneficial to any city, because wealth does not trickle down, it displaces. This is the collateral damage suffered Grenfell Tower is one symbol of this social violence, the iceberg luxury basements are another.• Anna Minton is the author of Big Capital: Who is London For? and a reader in architecture at the University of East London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8f10a3aba47667ab106c92ec2cb44161e655ed3/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d78640d5bee43b2547fbbbba22a5232","title":"from backstreet eats to five star feasts abu dhabis diverse dining scene","story":"Whether you’re on a blow-out budget or hunting for a bargain, Abu Dhabi has it all.

Yours for just AED 6 (£1.16), one makes for a tasty lunch, two the perfect late night sustenance.liwanmansour.aeTandoori CornerIndian restaurants in Abu Dhabi fall into two categories: slick and pricey hotel-based operations, and backstreet curry houses where the bill can come in at a tenth of the price or less. Tandoori Corner (which isn’t, in fact, on a corner) is very much the latter, though the food is easily as good as its five-star competition. As with many Indian restaurants in the city, there’s a whole menu of Chinese dishes, too, making it perfect for any group at loggerheads over what they fancy for dinner.MeylasEmirati food is oddly difficult to come by in the United Arab Emirates. Looking to redress the balance is Shaikha Al Kaabi, a young local who first set up a roving foodtruck serving modern takes on the dishes of her childhood, and has since opened a bricks-and-mortar site. Start with the fareed (a meat and veg stew), before graduating to harees (a wheat pudding with beef). Even if one plate isn’t to your taste, dishes start at AED 20 (£4), so risks are minimal.meylasenBonna AnneeAs is tradition in Ethiopian cuisine, dishes at this welcoming backstreet restaurant come served up on a spongy sourdough flatbread called injera. This edible plate also serves as cutlery – rip a patch off and use it to scoop up the slow-cooked stews and curries on top. The Bonna Annee Special – preposterous value at just AED 40 (£8) – comprises a mix of meat and veg dishes, and will feed two people very handsomely indeed.Bord EauAbu Dhabi’s restaurant scene is full of wacky concepts. Thankfully, between the classic French cooking and the modestly stylish dining room, there are none to be found at this polished waterfront restaurant. That’s not to call Bord Eau stuffy – even traditional dishes such as boeuf bourguignon and confit duck surprise with canny twists and inventive presentation. Best of all, though, is the fact that even the simple stuff is beyond decadent – try the outrageously silken, buttery mash potato for evidence.shangri-laabudhabishangrilaHakkasanIt’s not unusual for glitzy restaurant brands to put down roots in the UAE. But Hakkasan – one of the first to do so – is unique in that it’s still every bit as good as it was when it first arrived at Emirates Palace eight years ago.

If so, Abu Dhabi’s your placeThe United Arab Emirates has a reputation for the outlandish and the eccentric, and you’ll only need a few hours in its glitzy capital to see why. It’s hardly surprising, really: you can’t smush together centuries of Arabian tradition with oodles of international wealth – then use it to build one of the most ethnically erse, technologically ambitious cities on the planet – and expect the result to be run-of-the-mill. Looking for a break from the usual humdrum tourist itineraries? From high-speed camels to driverless cars, your hitlist starts here.Ride the world’s fastest roller coasterA veritable temple to the prancing horse, Ferrari World on Yas Island was the biggest indoor theme park on Earth when it opened in 2010. Its star attraction is Formula Rossa – a Formula One-themed ‘coaster that launches riders to a speed of 149mph in just four seconds, in the process inflicting the sort of G force that even Lewis Hamilton would describe as “a bit much”. Among other things, the park is also home to a fine-dining restaurant, which you’d do well to visit after your ride.Make tracks out to the desert for a camel raceAscot may have the upper hand when it comes to headwear, but for sheer dust-flinging excitement, a regular day at the races has nothing on the hump-backed alternative. This being Abu Dhabi, the regular meetings at Al Wathba – a short drive out of the city into the desert – are more high-tech, too, with robot jockeys taking the place of actual humans, who are relegated to riding alongside in SUVs and cheering like lunatics. Probably not how the Bedouin racers of yesteryear did it, but it’s a hell of a spectacle nonetheless.Hop aboard a driverless car in Masdar CitySomething a bit special is springing up out of the sand next to Abu Dhabi airport. Billing itself as a “greenprint” for how the sustainable cities of tomorrow will be built, Masdar City was envisaged as a 6 sq km (2.32 sq mile) district run entirely on renewable energy. This being the desert, most of the juice comes from solar power, which is used to run everything from street lights to the kitchens within the area’s growing stable of cafes and restaurants. Oh, and Masdar’s star attraction: the fleet of futuristic little driverless pods that zip visitors around the place like something out of a 90s sci-fi film.Admire the rainbow sheikh’s car collectionIt’s fair to say Sheikh Hamad bin Hamdan Al Nahyan is the petrolhead of the Emirati royal family. Set within a gleaming white pyramid just outside the city, the Emirates National Auto Museum houses the sheikh’s personal collection of cars, a fleet so vast and engine-revvingly macho it makes Jeremy Clarkson look like Jeremy Corbyn. Among the highlights are the world’s biggest pick-up truck (which has four bedrooms), a giant, driveable globe and a set of seven vintage Mercedes S-classes, one in each colour of the rainbow. Subtle? No. Spectacular? Oh yes.Clock a hot lap on an F1 trackWe’re sure the gym at your hotel is absolutely fine, but there’s a far more fun way to stay fit during your visit to Abu Dhabi. The Yas Marina Formula One race track welcomes walkers, runners, cyclists and rollerbladers on to its 5.5km (3.4 mile) grand prix circuit every Sunday and Tuesday evening (during the cooler months), and there’s even kit available to rent if you don’t fancy bringing your own. But no, sadly, they won’t let you spray rosewater from the podium if you set a new personal best.Strap on a water-powered jetpackIf you’ve ever fancied yourself as Iron-Man, flying around under your own steam, your luck is in. Thanks to the flyboard, a neat piece of kit that fires two high-pressure jets of water downwards, the wearer is able to float above the surface of the water. It’s simple enough even for watersport newbies to get to grips with in an hour-long lesson, and plenty of fun too.Experience the real Abu Dhabi.

The site opens its doors twice a day for the public to tour the hospital, where they can get an insight into the work that is done there. Visitors will even get a chance to feed the falcons, and there’s a museum on site. You can also learn about the sport of falconry in the hospital’s landscaped gardens. falconhospitalExperience the real Abu Dhabi.

That is bigger than oil, gas, life sciences, automotive and aeronautics combined.”Deller said he had recently been in a new flagship academy having a meeting in a room full of mirrors. He asked “what’s this” and was told the school had got rid of its dance teacher and now used the dance room for exams. “What a terrible thing for young people, what an incredible waste”, he said.He called the Ebacc “a huge mistake”, adding: “Thinking creatively is what is going to get Britain through a lot of the challenges of the next 10-20 years and that’s exactly what the arts do, they free up the mind.”Barlow, who taught in art schools from 1966 to 2009, said she had witnessed the erosion of the importance of the arts at all levels within education, especially over the last 15 to 20 years.“Without doubt, such ill-thought through policies and attitude to the arts is a tragedy. People, young and old, are being deprived of the opportunities to discover their talents and abilities as artists and innovators within disciplines across the board.“This philistinism must stop for the sake of future generations and the survival of the planet.”Kapoor said it showed the UK was being “led by a bunch of halfwits, at best”.He added: “The fact that we enslave our young people as fodder, and educate them as fodder for this monument to capitalism is outrageous. In older times, and not so long ago, an education meant an education in the arts and music and the classics. Have we so lost our sense of what it means to be civilised that all we care about are subjects directed to the economy. What’s wrong with us?”The Ebacc performance measure makes the sciences, English language and literature, maths, a language and geography or history compulsory for secondary school pupils. Critics say that this has narrowed access to art or dance or music or drama as schools concentrate on core subjects.The letter adds to warnings made by many arts leaders. The former director of the National Theatre, Nicholas Hytner, called the Ebacc policy one of the “biggest disasters of the last seven years” and pointed, with disdain, to an assertion by the former education secretary Nicky Morgan that arts subjects could hold pupils back for years.A study from the Education Policy Institute thinktank last year found that the number of teenagers taking GCSEs in arts subjects had fallen to its lowest proportion for a decade. The promotion of the Ebacc suite of subjects was one reason for the fall, it said.The 104 signatories to the new letter include 15 former Turner Prize winners including Lubaina Himid, Susan Philipsz, Richard Wright, Mark Wallinger, Grayson Perry, Wolfgang Tillmans and Gillian Wearing.The letter says the exclusion of arts and creative subjects “will seriously damage the future of many young people in this country”.A department for Education spokesperson said: “Our drive to ensure all pupils benefit from a stretching core academic curriculum through the Ebacc is not a barrier to pupils enjoying a high-quality arts education. In fact, since the introduction of the Ebacc the percentage of pupils taking arts GCSEs has remained stable.“We are investing nearly £500m in music and arts education programmes between 2016 and 2020. This includes the recent announcement of £96million to help talented pupils to attend prestigious arts institutions, such as the Royal Ballet School in London and Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb345d1c5b29923e920b047f02e25aa018d19488/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4a7b202073276d9abf7e74ac1b51b51","title":"parents in dark need top up student loans maintenance","story":"Experts attack government for failing to tell families they must pay up to £5,000 in living costsHow many parents realise that if their child goes to university, the government expects them to stump up thousands of pounds a year on top of the debt their offspring will incur from loans?According to the latest submissions to the current review of HE finance, the government is keeping parents in the dark about this. The review will decide whether and how the current fees and loans system should be changed.The government abolished maintenance grants, designed to cover costs such as food, rent and books, from the 2016-17 academic year. They were replaced by loans – in addition to the £9,250 a year tuition fee loan – with students from the lowest income families able to borrow the most.Many argue that it is indefensible that students from the poorest families now leave university with the biggest debts – an average of £57,000 according to an analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies last year. And the National Union of Students says that many working-class students still don’t have enough money to cover their daily needs, with many struggling to pay for food or heating.But experts also say the government is betraying students from middle-income families, by “refusing” to warn parents that they are expected to top up the loans for living costs. This can be as much as £4,500 a year for parents of students living outside London, and up to almost £5,000 a year for those in the capital.In its submission to the higher education funding review last week the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank attacked the government for failing to publish any information about these costs. Hepi’s director, Nick Hillman, said: “It’s a hidden nasty in the system. Most families don’t have £4,500 just lying around.”Martin Lewis, founder of the consumer website Moneysavingexpert, which has published its own breakdown of expected parental contributions, says it is “an absolute abomination” that the government is leaving parents in the dark.“If you aren’t entitled to a full maintenance loan, parents are expected to make up the gap, but what is outrageous is that the Student Loans Company tells you nothing at all about this,” he says. “It leads to friction in families and to students being underfunded.”Many families will just be trying to get to grips with university living costs as they apply for student finance – the deadline for which is this month. Rachel Wylie, from Wells in Somerset, whose daughter is hoping to start a textiles degree at Loughborough University in the autumn, says: “We’ve been to information evenings at school and they told us the government assumes you will top up the loan, but the Student Loans Company didn’t make that clear. If I hadn’t turned up I simply wouldn’t know.”Wylie, who works in health education, says: “We’ve had a university savings pot, but it isn’t enough money to cover everything, so we are definitely going to have to make some sacrifices.”She says that even if her daughter were entitled to the maximum loan for living costs it wouldn’t cover the full costs of living in halls of residence.Claire Callender, professor of higher education at Birkbeck, University of London, and at University College London’s Institute of Education, says: “I think one of the problems for the government is the politics behind telling parents – who are of course voters – exactly how much money they should contribute.”She adds that parents may resent the government telling them how much they have to put in from their own pockets – especially if they can’t afford it.A report on poverty among working-class students by the National Union of Students last month found the new maintenance loans “routinely” fell short of funding average student living costs, with many students unable to pay for enough food or heating.Ruth Wilkinson, president of Kent University Students Union, says: “I know students who are living hand to mouth. They are working as hard as they can in paid jobs in addition to their studies, and every spare penny after paying for their accommodation goes on food.”She adds: “We end up talking to some of the students who are really struggling because they turn up to our events knowing there will be free food. They aren’t paying for heating in winter as that’s a luxury. They are living in damp, mouldy flats trying to study.”The NUS says that the cost of renting a room in student halls has soared in recent years, and now typically exceeds what is affordable with the government maintenance loan. They are calling for universities to demonstrate that they provide some cheap accommodation for lower income students as part of the access and retention agreements they have to make with the government’s access regulator.The NUS and the vice-chancellors’ group Universities UK have both called on the government to reinstate maintenance grants. Last week Hepi described the abolition of grants as “a big error”, and backed calls for them to be brought backYet the think tank noted that this could cost taxpayers in the region of £2 billion a year.But Lewis argues if there are limited funds this shouldn’t be the top priority. “If you want social equality you’ve got to face the fact that students haven’t got enough money to live on. The loans aren’t big enough. So I wouldn’t lower tuition fees, or bring back maintenance grants, I’d boost maintenance loans.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/267727d6c52c0ac1a386add3cfe9555d4f974085/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=490ca23cb4113a75caaa64454ca7930a","title":"footwear rules for summer the heel is the new toe","story":"Pumice stones at the ready … from the arty mule to the holiday slipper, here are some of the best examples of the heel-flashing trendGetting ready for that summer pedicure? No, me neither. But there is good news for those who identify as lazy when it comes to their feet. This season, toes will be a rare site in fashionable circles, and toe cleavage is practically illegal, according to the denizens of the front row. This year’s look is all about the closed-toe mule, you see. A quick swipe with the pumice stone is all you need. Here are four of the most fashionable heel-flashers around.When Maria Grazia Chiuri came to Dior in July 2016, she put feminism front and centre of her own new look. Ballet flats, it’s fair to say, are a bit too cutesy to scream intersectionality or any other zeitgeisty term. Instead, Chiuri gave them a rework by tweaking the bow to the side of the shoe, adding a point to the front and emancipating your heels. Other brands have followed suit. Meet your take-you-everywhere summer shoe - that includes marching on anti-Trump protests, obvs.Asos has a whole category entitled “holiday shoes”. We like its style. The backless loafer introduced by Gucci – complete with shearling – in 2015 has morphed into the kind of shoes that demand attention, or at least a rooftop and a caipirinha before lunch. Maximalist styles ranging from XL pompoms to rainbow stripes are all invited, and all on the high street, too.Anyone who follows Simon Porte Jacquemus on Instagram will find not employing the adjective “adorable” tricky. Paris’s golden boy, who posts videos of tulips on bicycles and donkeys on the beach, along with himself in oversized picture hats, has also had a hand in making shoes with heels that could quite easily pass in a Ettore Sottsass exhibition. Topshop and other brands are exploring other heel shapes. Expect ball-heeled mules at gallery openings this summer.It doesn’t get much better than your shoe of choice enjoying the Marilyn Monroe seal of approval. The actor wore slingbacks in that 1955 subway grate scene in The Seven Year Itch. OK, those were open-toed, but 2018’s version has all the mid-century charm without any toe issues. Prada’s came with punk attitude but gingham gives a bit of classic wholesomeness that the 50s would totally get. It also looks great with that other Monroe fashion favourite, denim."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6244a8e7c5b502e9f16cb55cf513976c938fcb9b/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e60f0f5fd79a5181f878cd7bc7c45fb2","title":"met gala 2018 best dress code catholicism fashion","story":"This year’s theme of Catholicism in fashion was a challenge that required a leap of faith. But from Rihanna’s pope to Lena Waithe’s rainbow-flag cape, the opening night ball was a triumphIt took curator Andrew Bolton several years to convince the Vatican to give its blessing to Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination, the blockbuster show at the politan Museum in New York that explores ine inspiration in fashion. One imagines Rome’s reluctance stemmed from concern that the exhibition – and particularly the opening night gala, which has become known for its outrageous outfits – would trivialise religious imagery.It needn’t have worried. Fashion takes clothes very, very seriously. In a world in which dressing up matters and sartorial symbolism carries a very real weight, the Met Gala is the most important night of the year. Even when it looks absurd to outsiders – remember the omelette dress of 2015? – the fashion seen on the Met Gala red carpet has been considered and planned with the solemnity of a papal conclave. In their Manhattan hotel rooms, celebrities dress for this event with a level of meticulous ceremony which would befit a Sunday at St Peters.This year’s dress code was a challenge. To succeed on this red carpet required honouring the theme of Catholicism in fashion without being seen to make fun of it. What is special about the Met red carpet – by comparison, for instance, with Cannes – is that you can’t win it just by looking good. A supermodel can wear a tight dress and high heels and sail through almost every other public occasion with flying colours, but that look is a fast track to being completely ignored at the Met. You have to dig deep for this night, because Met Gala triumph requires not just beauty but bravery and a leap of faith. The Vatican would surely approve.The obvious link between the world presided over by Pope Francis and the one ruled by Queen Anna Wintour is that clothing delineates status. Rihanna attacked this theme with her signature fearlessness and blew everyone else out of the water. In the season of the first Millicent Fawcett statue and of a Christian Dior slogan T-shirt namechecking Linda Nochlin’s feminist essay “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists”, RiRi gave us a female pope. She wore a heavily embellished mini dress under a matching cloak, accessorised with a pointed mitre, stiletto heels and pearls strung around one ankle – because, after all, there’s not always room for a rosary in a clutch bag – all created for her by John Galliano for the house of Maison Margiela. The look was a version of an ensemble designed by Galliano during his time at Christian Dior that appeared on the catwalk in 2000 worn by a man, and is included in the Met exhibition.But clothes are never only about power, either in fashion or in the church. Beauty as a metaphor for human goodness runs through the history of art, through religious iconography and through the way fashion worships at the altar of beauty and glamour. Katy Perry was a triumph in Versace. In a gold dress and boots, and with a 6ft white feathered wing, she was arguably the most breathtaking representation of the archangel Gabriel since Fra Angelico painted the Annunciation fresco in the Convent of San Marco. (And yes, I do realise how sacrilegious that is, in artistic terms.)Sienna Miller in gold and white Louis Vuitton was also ine as another Renaissance angel on the red carpet.The transactional business of fashion is a multimillion-pound industry precisely because it taps into powerful emotions and desires. Fashion deliberately blurs the boundaries between things that you have the power to change and the things you don’t. (You can buy the perfect party dress, but you can’t actually buy romance or joy or fun.) Religious imagery has long employed the same porous boundaries, conjuring the invisible into life. The word halo – an accessory seen last night on Solange Knowles in Iris Van Herpen and Lily Collins in Givenchy, among others – means glory. And the aesthetic of papal garments has roots in worldly power, as well as spiritual. When the Emperor Constantine moved his capital east to Constantinople and allowed the pontiffs to assume control the old capital, Rome, they incorporated some of the clothing and accessories worn by the Roman emperors who had ruled before them, the better to legitimise their power in the eyes of the people of Rome.Like all the best dress codes, the Met Gala invitation allowed for lots of iniduality. Frances McDormand consolidated her role as 2018’s designated maverick by coming as “a pagan”, she said on the red carpet, in her Valentino butterfly headdress. Those actors who have pledged vows to fashion houses (or at least, signed contracts with them) showed their constancy with looks that mined clerical robes for the most this-season silhouette. A clear winner on this is the mozzetta, a short shoulder-covering robe worn by the pope and cardinals and, last night, by a very chic Alicia Vikander in Louis Vuitton. Kate Moss wore a black dress with a feathered black neckline that nodded to the dress code with a fallen-angel vibe – this was her first appearance in the US since 2009, and there was speculation that the prolonged absence was due to difficulty procuring a visa after the drug scandal of 2005 – but mainly referenced herself. Moss in a black feather trim dress, with Johnny Depp at Cannes, and a messy bun, is a late-1990s fashion reference the fashion faithful will immediately recognise.Best red-carpet quote of the night, though, goes to the actor Lena Waithe, who wore a rainbow flag cape to spotlight the Catholic church’s complicated relationship with the LGBTQ community. “The theme to me is, like, be yourself,” she told the New York Times on the red carpet. “You were made in God’s image, right?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52ca83df70a4437839922a36439e22b801a4e8dc/0_244_4056_2435/master/4056.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=646ed41f7d3f9dcca07f7db8a9d764a6","title":"met gala 2018 pageantry and performance on the red carpet in pictures","story":"The 70th annual Met Ball was themed Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic ImaginationElon Musk is dating Grimes – plus four other things we learned at Met Gala 2018"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f83ca7af2941fd4734126958e364ee60b6b69099/195_534_1610_966/master/1610.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eda6c22fa20213f8c4a7c96a4120076","title":"cannes 2018 top 10 film festival","story":"Asghar Farhadi goes Spanish, Spike Lee delivers a biopic of the black police officer who infiltrated the KKK – and Lars von Trier returnsA passionate, mysterious love story in postwar Poland between a musician and a young singer recruited as part of a communist-approved folk music troupe.Debra Granik, who directed Winter’s Bone, comes to Directors’ Fortnight with this fascinating, subtle wilderness story of a man (Ben Foster) who takes his 13-year-old daughter to live with him in secret in a public park.A Spanish-language thriller from the Iranian director Asghar Farhadi.

There have been no further reports of illness this week and the hotel therefore remains operational.”Southampton and Swansea, in 17th and 18th place respectively, both have 33 points and the south coast club are above their rivals on goal difference.

Sorry, reader, The Fiver has just seen some previews and felt the need to test a theory, which turns out to be unsound: it clearly is possible to overstate the importance of Tuesday’s big relegation showdown.But it’s a doozy of a clash, all the same, and definitely not the sort that a manager would want to lose without an excuse. Happily, Ailsa from Home and Away has one to hand if required, thanks to the Marriott hotel in Swansea. Southampton turned up there on Monday and prepared to tuck Nathan Redmond into bed when staff informed the club their booking could not be fulfilled because of a sudden outbreak of a virus. Mysteriously, the hotel’s website suggested other guests could still be accommodated but Southampton were told to go elsewhere, and the only place that could meet their princess-and-the-pea like criteria is close to Cardiff. The switch could add at least an hour to Southampton’s pre-match drive. So that’s effectively a two-goal lead for Swansea already, right?Not that football’s most prolific conspiracy theorist since David Icke needs help finding external factors to blame for his team’s failures. Back in August, for instance, he attributed his Stoke side’s inability to beat West Brom to the grass at the Hawthorns, which, reckoned Ailsa, had been deliberately left long to sabotage the intricate passing of Ryan Shawcross and Peter Crouch. And there is scarcely a referee in England who hasn’t been accused of ineptitude by a manager who is perilously close to being involved in the relegation of two clubs in one season.That wouldn’t be a unique feat, in fairness. In fact, it could be the start of a hat-trick like the one English football enjoyed in the 1980s. Ron Saunders got the ball rolling in 1986 when, five years after winning the title with Aston Villa, he gilded his legendary status at Villa Park by leading Birmingham City and West Brom towards the drop. Villa fans didn’t get to laugh about that for long, though. Because the following season they went down under Billy McNeill, hired after leaving Manchester City, who went down with them. And the season after that Dave Bassett completed things in style, leaving Watford when they were falling out of the top flight only to take over Sheffield United, who were promptly relegated to the third tier.It would be some going to join that roll of honour, not least because it would entail failing to win against a Swansea side that have only scored two goals in their last seven matches and appear to be running exclusively on Carlos Carvalhal’s amusing metaphors.

Leave it in its plastic bag surrounded by the cloudy siero (whey), at room temperature, until you are ready to eat it. Placed on a chilly shelf, mozzarella is like an inadequately dressed person on a cold day: it braces and seizes up, losing its soft, velvety texture and, like a cold tomato, doesn’t taste of much.Do put mozzarella in the fridge, however, if you are going to cook with it. The seizing-up and drying-out is exactly what you want for an aubergine parmigiana or baked pasta, the slightly drier slices or cubes not weeping liquid the way they would if the mozzarella was kingly fresh.Once upon a time, all mozzarella was di bufala, made from the milk of the buffalos that have grazed on the pastures of Campania – the southern region of which Naples is capital – since the ninth century. Buffalo milk has a higher fat content than cow’s, so produces creamier, more fragrant mozzarella, managing to be both sweet and decidedly savoury.Growing popularity and demand for mozzarella throughout Italy in the 19th century, and then the world, meant people began making it with cow’s milk, or with a mixture of milks, but there was little differentiation – every stretched cheese simply became “mozzarella”. Classification has helped, the protecting DOP means it must state origin and whether it is di bufala, a mix, or cow’s milk (which is rightly known as fior di latte and can be extremely good).If you live in Campania and have an abundance of mozzarella di bufala, you might well cook with it, but even in nearby Rome, I rarely do: mozzarella di bufala is a prize and to be eaten just so – possibly with tomato and basil an anchovy maybe. For cooking, mixed milk or fior di latte is fine: it, too, is best left in the fridge for a day or two to dry out a little.Today’s recipe is another from Oretta Zanini de Vita, a weekday dinner dish she calls gratin alla Sorrentina, coming from the Sorrento region of Campania. It is the simplest of the baked pasta family the butter and cheese sauce is created on the surface of al dente pasta in the pan, then tipped into a dish and baked. It is neither creamy nor gloopy, rather gently flavoured and crisp on top. Plainly good.Oretta is quite bossy – which I like – and says you shouldn’t add anything. Sometimes I listen, sometimes I don’t, adding more cheese, peas, hard-boiled egg (my Sicilian partner Vincenzo would add them to every baked pasta if he could), and a big spoonful of mascarpone.Boil 500g pasta in salted water – fusilli is ideal – until al dente, then drain. Put the pasta back in the hot, empty pan with 75g room-temperature butter, 400g small-diced mozzarella, 75g grated pecorino or parmesan, (or a mix of the two) and a few good grinds of black pepper, then stir over a low flame until the mozzarella is melting and pulling into strings. Now tip everything into a buttered ovenproof dish, sprinkle the top with another handful of grated pecorino and some breadcrumbs, then dot generously with butter.To finish, bake the pasta at 180C350Fgas 4 for 20 minutes, turning on the grill for the last five minutes so the top browns. This is a gentle dish, so it needs contrast: serve alongside a crisp, green salad with a sharp vinegar dressing, maybe, and a cold bottle of wine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8875b37c7868bcb0e835bb5c3c27b0cc1d232c01/0_202_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f58b2b8450bbbc2b9e3ef24010d11bc","title":"pool basement wealth super rich digging down london","story":"In London’s richest boroughs vast subterranean enclaves are being carved out over several floors to house cars, wine, saunas and private nightclubs. How did underground living – once associated with poverty and disease – become an investment scheme for the uber-wealthy?With its eclectic fusion of Regency and mythological motifs, Havona House stands out amid the stucco-fronted Victorian townhouses in Notting Hill’s Pembridge Villas. The newly built mansion’s mock neoclassical columns and the limestone carvings of Greek deities on the facade reflect the roots of its owner, property investor Costas Diamantopoulos. Stepping inside the 8,600 sq ft (800 sq m) property, which is on the market for £25m, you are confronted by an array of opulent features, including a free-floating stone staircase, hand-blown glass pendants and marble en-suite bathrooms.If your neighbourhood has been affected by basement developments, or you own one or have been involved in their construction, and have experienced any of the issues in this story or similar, we would like to hear from you.

On its first floor is an underground garage, in which up to three cars can be parked via robotic platforms. On the lower floor is a 70ft swimming pool, which is filled by a waterfall that cascades over mirrored panels, with a cinema screen to the left. Mango onyx marble panels line the right-hand wall, with a Turkish bath, sauna, shower and a gym further on the other side. At the far end is a £30,000 plaster sculpture of four dancing figures, based on a painting by Poussin. The artwork also hints at the room’s special feature: at the push of a button, hidden hydraulic legs raise the ceramic-tiled floor to transform the space into a dancefloor. “In four to five minutes you can go from having a pool to a huge area of entertainment,” says Diamantopoulos.This is the second basement development Diamantopoulos has built in London in 10 years. He oversaw a much smaller one in 2008 under his former home in Cheyne Place, opposite the Chelsea Physic Garden, although it, too, has a pool, cinema screen, gym and sauna. This property is also for sale, for a comparatively modest £12m, under the terms of Diamantopoulos’s orce settlement. But he says his family regularly congregated in the basement when it was their main residence. He would swim in the oval blue-tiled pool, inspired by his childhood memories of the Greek islands, making use of the wave machine, or relax in the sauna, while his older daughter and her friends would use the gym. “If someone has the space and the ability, I would always recommend a basement,” he says.As decadent as they may seem, the features of Diamantopoulos’s basements are typical of many of those built under central London’s most exclusive neighbourhoods in the past decade, according to a new study by Newcastle University’s global urban research unit. The report, Mapping Subterranean London: the Hidden Geography of Residential Basement Developments, found at least 4,650 basements were granted planning permission in Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham, Haringey, Camden, Islington and Wandsworth between 2008 and 2017. According to their planning applications, these schemes boast at least 376 swimming pools, 456 cinemas, 996 gyms, 381 wine stores and cellars, 340 games and recreation rooms, 241 saunas or steam rooms, 115 staff quarters, including bedrooms for nannies and au pairs, 65 garages, 40 libraries, two gun stores, a car museum, a banquet hall and an artificial beach.The vast amount of extra space built under prime London properties contrasts starkly with the shrinking size of newly built homes bought by average families. For example, living rooms are nearly a third smaller than equivalent homes built in the 1970s, falling from 268 sq ft in the 1970s to 184 sq ft in a house built since 2010, according to another recent study. Burrows says: “One cannot but be struck by how the amount of living space different households have available to them differs now. In our research we have come across some basement developments in central London where just the pool, gym and cinema combined are larger than the newbuild rabbit-hutch homes that many people have to put up with.”Nowhere is this more evident than in Kensington and Chelsea, the capital’s richest borough, which has about 4,900 UHNWIs, and has the highest number of large and mega-basements, often two or more storeys deep and extended under the garden. Beth Holroyd, co-author of the study, says variations in the scale and sumptuousness of basements reveal the wealth gap between London’s merely rich, such as corporate lawyers and accountants, and the global super-rich, including bankers and oligarchs. Holroyd says: “There is a clear pattern of association between the level of neighbourhood affluence and both the size and extravagance of the basements. The pool is a clear marker of wealth.”On Tregunter Road, in the Boltons conservation area of Chelsea renowned for its Italianate Victorian housing, the researchers found 22 approved basements, with features including 12 swimming pools and five cinemas. Five of these basements are standard-sized, 11 are classified as large and six as mega. One of the mega-basements, with a pool, gym and car lift, is in an 8,000 sq ft townhouse on the market for £26m. Four of the basements are currently under construction. Outside one, a huge red crane lowers building materials into the rear garden, under which, planning documents suggest, a two-storey basement with a pool, cinema, gym, wine store, steam room, salon and staff room is being created. Another two-storey basement with almost identical features is being excavated under a house across the street.“I can see that from my garden,” says local resident Shirley, who lives round the corner on the Boltons, gesturing at the crane with her walking stick. “We’ve had something like that or worse going on for years. We’ve had incredible noise and vibrations. I’m sure there have been momentary gaps. Our feeling is it’s too extreme. Very wealthy people buy them hoping to get the price rise and do them up and sell them and the next person does the same. Only a few of them are here all the time.”Alistair Langhorne and Claire Bunten, directors of LAB Architects, have been designing basements in the Boltons conservation area since 2008. On a tour of the area, Langhorne says that even here most of their clients want a basement to enhance their family life, rather than for property speculation – although Bunten admits that the budgets for some schemes were “otherworldly”. “They’ve all probably got homes elsewhere in the world but this is their main residence,” adds Langhorne.The basement boom began in the late 1990s in Hammersmith and Fulham and Wandsworth, according to architects and developers, with middle-class families renovating their Victorian coal cellars. Excavations became more substantial as planning constraints made building above ground in central London extremely difficult, while, from 2010 onwards, stamp duty rises on property purchases over £1m made the costs of moving prohibitive, forcing owners to expand downwards. Only 23 of the basements the Newcastle researchers identified in these boroughs have pools – compared with 224 in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea – and the vast majority are standard-sized – one storey under the footprint of the house.But Burrows believes that mega-basements will continue. “There will always be a few uber-wealthy types who seem immune to the vicissitudes of the economy, politics and local planning policies,” he says. “They always seem to find ways of getting around restrictions to build their luxury pools, galleries, cinemas or virtual reality golf courses. There may be fewer of those really massive basements now, but the trend is not finished yet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/392b13c6f4601a9e11d61c220f84c53ddd6de0ee/0_172_2088_1252/master/2088.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04ee9dc8d6198f0f9e7687bcf94ec3a9","title":"don mclean bridgewater hall manchester","story":"Bridgewater Hall, ManchesterThe country rocker pays tribute to his musical heroes with a rapt trip down memory lane – and a dig at Kanye WestOn 3 February, 1959, a plane crash near Clear Lake, Iowa, took the lives of rock’n’rollers Buddy Holly, Richie Valens and the Big Bopper. “The day the music died” inspired Don McLean’s signature 1971 hit American Pie, an eight-and-a-half minute, 800-word lament for rock’n’roll and a farewell to the 1960s which, along the way, referenced everyone and thing from Elvis Presley, Mick Jagger and Janis Joplin to the killing of Meredith Hunter at the Altamont festival in 1969. McLean’s best-known song has become too ubiquitous for some, but if he’s ever done a concert since without playing it, it isn’t going to be this one. “I may get lost in my reverie, but I will keep my statutory responsibilities,” he says, prompting knowing waves of applause.The singer-songwriter is 72, his tenor has lowered an octave or two and has a slightly shouty timbre in the upbeat moments, but he has the energy for a two-hour show in which his hero Holly’s Everyday still features. McLean introduces one of his great, early songs And I Love You So with a story about how, aged 25, he was so angry when his first album was rejected “by 20 record companies” that he threw the tapes out in the snow. “And here we are, 47 years later.” Hearing his young self’s thoughts coming from him now is undeniably moving.McLean has had a tough time lately. The breakdown of his almost 30-year marriage led to a widely reported incident where his wife called the police and took out a restraining order, but then in his defence informed the media that “Don is not a monster”. He always was an emotional character, and McLean’s best work is deeply sentimental without quite becoming mawkish. Winterwood, about appreciating nature and a former partner after a breakup, is one such example. Crossroads, a 1971 song about a man’s humbling admission of his flaws, is another. He touches an eye during the line: “That was never our defeat, as long as we could walk together.”The mood lightens with quips (“I hope I don’t have an aneurysm up here”) and a stream of country rockers. The Lucky Guy comes from his new album, Botanical Gardens, but McLean’s music has barely changed since American Pie. “I mix popular song with rock’n’roll and folk. I don’t understand who Kanye West is,” he explains, adding, a trifle unnecessarily: “All ego and no talent.” There are cheers as he jokes: “That goes a long way – ask our president. Only kidding.”Ray Charles’s bluesy I’m Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town gets toes tapping and Johnny Horton’s Got the Bull By the Horns is rendered Jerry Lee Lewis style, but there are too many sedately paced rock’n’roll era covers. Still, McLean’s own Castles in the Air is lovely, and hearing him sing Vincent – his youthful eulogy to Van Gogh – is magical, a bucket-list moment. No one here minds much that in places during American Pie he’s all but drowned out by the band. It turns into a sing-song marathon, and one chap is escorted away after simulating the act of prayer at the singer’s feet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dee934959a12352384ae4580f97415c1357237b9/0_0_2228_1336/master/2228.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3da56b49049abf0e12e054a1950a94aa","title":"how the chicken nugget became the true symbol of our era","story":"This is what happens when you turn the natural world into a profit-making machine. By  Raj Patel and  Jason W MooreThe most telling symbol of the modern era isn’t the automobile or the smartphone. It’s the chicken nugget. Chicken is already the most popular meat in the US, and is projected to be the planet’s favourite flesh by 2020. Future civilisations will find traces of humankind’s 50 billion bird-a-year habit in the fossil record, a marker for what we now call the Anthropocene. And yet responsibility for the dramatic change in our consumption lies not so much in general human activity, but capitalism. Although we’re taught to understand it as an economic system, capitalism doesn’t just organise hierarchies of human work. Capitalism is what happens when power and money combine to turn the natural world into a profit-making machine. Indeed, the way we understand nature owes a great deal to capitalism.Every civilisation has had some rendering of the difference between “us” and “them”, but only under capitalism is there a boundary between “society” and “nature” – a violent and tightly policed border with deep roots in colonialism.First taking shape in the era of Chistopher Columbus, capitalism created a peculiar binary order. “Nature” became the antonym of “society” in the minds of philosophers, in the policies of European empires, and the calculations of global financial centres. “Nature” was a place of profit, a vast frontier of free gifts waiting to be accepted by conquerors and capitalists.This was a dangerous view of nature for all sorts of reasons, not least because it simultaneously degraded human and animal life of every kind. What we call “cheap nature” included not only forests and fields and streams, but also the vast majority of humankind. In the centuries between Columbus and the industrial revolution, enslaved and indentured Africans, Asians, indigenous peoples and virtually all women became part of “nature” – and treated cheaply as a result. When humans can be treated with such little care, it’s not surprising that other animals fare even worse under capitalism, especially the ones we end up paying to eat.Animals have been at the epicentre of five centuries of dietary transformation, which sharply accelerated after the second world war. The creation of the modern world depended on the movement of cattle, sheep, horses, pigs and chickens into the new world, reinforcing the murderous advance of microbes, soldiers and bankers after 1492. Capitalism’s “ecological hoofprint”, to use food scholar Tony Weis’s well-turned phrase, has become radically globalised ever since. In the half-century after 1961, Weis tells us, per capita meat and egg consumption has doubled, and the number of slaughtered animals leapt eightfold, from eight to 64 billion.To those with a romantic view of where their food comes from, uncooked meat appears to be a raw ingredient rather than a processed one. Quite the opposite. Feed and oilseed crops form part of what Weis terms “the industrial grain-oilseed-livestock complex”. Markets for grain made it possible for meat not just to become cheap food, but also to back financial instruments. Futures contracts in pork bellies, for instance, in turn require the uniformity, homogenisation and industrialisation of the crops they transform. Raw meat in the supermarket is, in other words, cooked up by a sophisticated and intensive arm of capitalism’s ecology.The environmental consequences of meat production are, of course, external to industrial agriculture’s bottom line. Nature is merely the pool from which animals are drawn and factory farmed, and the dump into which their, and our, waste disappears. The danger lies in believing the ision between nature and society is real, in seeing “factory farming” as an environmental question and “factory production” as a social question. Social questions are environmental questions, and vice versa.Chickens don’t turn into nuggets by themselves. Capitalists need cheap work. With the European invasion of the new world in 1492, that labour presented itself in the bodies of indigenous people. By the late 16th century, when Spaniards were desperately trying to revive silver production at the great silver mountain of Potosí, in present-day Bolivia, they began using the word naturales to refer to indigenous people. Through hard work and prayer, those indigenous people, and enslaved Africans, might find ine redemption through work and perhaps even, one day long in the future, entry into society as equals.Work was never meant to be fun. Consider the etymology of the French travail and the Spanish trabajo, each a translation of the English noun “work”: their Latin root is trepaliare, “to torture, to inflict suffering or agony.” But the way work works has changed.For millennia, most humans survived through more or less intimate relations with land and sea. Even those who didn’t were closely connected to the tasks and objects of labour. Human survival depended on holistic, not fragmented, knowledge: fishers, nomads, farmers, healers, cooks and many others experienced and practised their work in a way directly connected to the web of life. Farmers, for instance, had to know soils, weather patterns, seeds – in short, everything from planting to harvest. That didn’t mean work was pleasant – slaves were often treated brutally. Nor did it mean that the relations of work were equitable: guild masters exploited journeymen, lords exploited serfs, men exploited women, the old exploited the young. But work was premised on a holistic sense of production and a connection to wider worlds of life and community.In the 16th century, that began to shift. The enterprising Dutch or English farmer – and the Madeiran, then Brazilian, sugar planter – was increasingly connected to growing international markets for processed goods, and correspondingly more interested in the relationship between work time and the harvest. International markets pushed local transformations. Land in England was consolidated though enclosure, which concurrently “freed” a growing share of the rural population from the commons that they had tended, supported and survived on. These newly displaced peasants were free to find other work, and free to starve or face imprisonment if they failed.CAAIR’s recruits were predominantly young and white, but the majority of poultry workers are people of colour. Latinx immigrants are a vital force in US agriculture, and the delivery of their cheap work was made possible by class restructuring on two fronts. One, in the US, was a strong movement in the 1980s by newly aggressive meat-packing firms to destroy union power and replace unionised workers with low-wage immigrant labour. The other was the destabilisation of Mexico’s agrarian order after 1994 by the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which resulted in flows of cheap immigrant labour – unemployed workers displaced by capitalism’s ecology from one side of the US border to the other.A line on a map between two states is a powerful abstraction, one that has been used recently by the far right to recruit and spread fear, and for much longer by capitalists in search of ever cheaper and more profitable workers. Under capitalism, national territories, locally owned land and new migrating workers are produced simultaneously.With migrant workers came elite fears of the itinerant poor. In 17th- and 18th-century England, this panic resulted in harsh laws against vagabondage, and the development of charities to ameliorate the worst effects of enforced destitution. Threats of imprisonment moved the poor into waged work, an activity that took the intelligence, strength and dexterity of humans and disciplined them to productive labour using another modern invention: a new way of measuring time.If the practice of labour shapes capitalism’s ecology, its indispensable machine is the mechanical clock. The clock – not money – emerged as the key technology for measuring the value of work. This distinction is crucial because it’s easy to think that working for wages is capitalism’s signature. It’s not: in 13th-century England only a third of the economically active population depended on wages for survival. That wages have become a decisive way of structuring life, space and nature owes everything to a new model of time.By the early 14th century, the new temporal model was shaping industrial activity. In textile-manufacturing towns like Ypres, in what is now Belgium, workers found themselves regulated not by the flow of activity or the seasons but by a new kind of time – abstract, linear, repetitive. In Ypres, that work time was measured by the town’s bells, which rang at the beginning and end of each work shift. By the 16th century, time was measured in steady ticks of minutes and seconds. This abstract time came to shape everything – work and play, sleep and waking, credit and money, agriculture and industry, even prayer. By the end of the 16th century, most of England’s parishes had mechanical clocks.Spain’s conquest of the Americas involved inculcating in their residents a new notion of time as well as of space. Wherever European empires penetrated, there appeared the image of the “lazy” native, ignorant of the imperatives of Christ and the clock. Policing time was central to capitalism’s ecology. As early as 1553, the Spanish crown began installing “at least one public clock” in its major colonial cities. Other civilisations had their own sophisticated temporal rules, but the new regimes of work displaced indigenous tempos and relationships with the natural world. The Mayan calendar is a complex hierarchy of times and readings from the heavens, offering a rich set of arrangements of humans within the universe. Spanish invaders respected it only to this extent: they synchronised their colonial assaults to sacred moments in the calendar.As social historian EP Thompson observes in his seminal study Time, Work-Discipline and Industrial Capitalism, the governance of time follows a particular logic: “In mature capitalist society all time must be consumed, marketed, put to use it is offensive for the labour force merely to ‘pass the time’.” The connection of specific activities to larger productive goals didn’t allow for time theft, and the discipline of the clock was enforced by violence across the planet.Fights over the regulation of time continue even now. On US poultry lines, there is a federal law limiting the speed at which birds are processed: 140 birds per minute. The industry is lobbying to eliminate the limit, so that it can compete with factories in Brazil and Germany, where the rate is nearer 200 bpm. Worries about higher rates of food contamination and worker injury are being outweighed by the certain profit from more dead chickens.Capitalism has always experimented with every available kind of labour system simultaneously. A sugar plantation in 1630s Brazil, for example, would be easily recognisable as a modern industrial operation in, say, the Bangladeshi textile industry. Just as autoworkers on the line assemble simplified, interchangeable parts and fast-food workers manufacture standardised burgers, so did African slaves work specialised jobs in a simplified landscape of sugar monoculture.Behind the modern factory, there has always been a layer-cake of exploitation. Managers of factories were salaried more than the workers, who worked with raw materials acquired through various kinds of peonage and natural resource exploitation, and all of them depended on free domestic labour, usually from women. The global factory depends on a global mine, a global farm, and a global family.Hence the persistence today of slavery. One UN agency, the International Labour Organization, estimates there are 40 million people in slavery today, the majority of whom are women, many in forced marriages. Wartime work camps in, say, the Democratic Republic of the Congo supply the rare-earth metals such as tantalum that power the physical infrastructure behind the virtual economy.But just as management looks to find new ways to generate profit, so workers find ways to resist. Early capitalism’s great commodity frontiers – of sugar, silver, copper, iron, forest products, fishing and even cereal agriculture – were zones of experimentation in strategies of labour control in Europe and its colonies, and always spaces of conflict. Strikes, rebellions, negotiations and resistance characterised the application of capitalist work disciplines. Every resistance by labour was a new reason to bring in machines. Modern work regimes and technologies emerged from the crucible of experiments, strategies and resistances of early modern workers.Worker unrest in factories and slave rebellions, past and present, are linked not just because they are expressions of resistance, but because they are protests against the ecology of capitalism. Every global factory needs a global farm: industrial, technological and service enterprises rely on the extraction of work and cheap nature to thrive. The apps on your iPhone, designed in Cupertino, California, might have been coded by self-exploiting independent software engineers, and the phone itself assembled in draconian workplaces in China, and run on minerals extracted in inhumane conditions in the Congo. Modern manufacturing relies on layered, simultaneous and different regimes of work. And in response to every act of resistance against it, capitalism has moved the frontiers of work yet again.Hegemony over workers has been aided by cheap food, and the promise of a chicken in every pot. Cheap food has been central to the maintenance of order for millennia. But in the ecology of capitalism, that order has been maintained through planetary transformation.Since the 15th century, some land has become the exclusive domain of specific kinds of crops and crop systems: fields of monocultures designed to bring in flows of cash. Other areas were reserved to house those humans who had been excommunicated from those lands, to be better placed at the service of capitalists in cities. It was always a socially unstable geography, with low industrial wages supported by lower peasant wages supported by free gifts from nature, women and the colonies. After the revolutions of the 19th and 20th centuries offered workers the promise of alternatives to exploitation, capitalist fears of urban uprising and communism reached fever pitch. To allay this existential dread, governments and foundations did not address inequality or exploitation. Instead, they funded the development of crops that would grow abundantly enough to provide cheap food and curb urban hunger.That it was urban, and not rural, hunger that troubled policy makers is vitally important. Food and employment for people in rural areas – where most of the world’s hunger was concentrated – were of little concern. Hunger began to matter politically only when the poor came to the cities and translated it into anger, and thence potentially into insurrection and a challenge to the rule of cheap nature. It’s here – in the bourgeois concern about that rule and its need for worker quiescence – that we find the origin of what came to be known as the Green Revolution.The aim was to breed varieties of cereals that might flow freely through urban areas. But the revolution wasn’t simply an agronomic transformation. It required more than magic seeds. In order for farmers to grow the crops, national governments had to subsidise the purchase of crops through agricultural marketing boards, to lay the infrastructure for irrigation, and to suppress political dissent around alternative food systems. The Green Revolution of the early- to mid-20th century was a package of reforms designed to prevent the revolutionary political goal of many peasants’ and landless workers’ movements: comprehensive land and agrarian reform.But the prodigious output did not reduce hunger. Wheat production in India soared, but the amount that Indians ate hardly improved. Hunger, particularly in an economy dependent on agriculture, doesn’t end if people remain poor: it doesn’t matter how much grain there is if you can’t afford to buy it. Indeed, it is a global phenomenon that from 1990 to 2015, prices of processed food rose far less than those of fresh fruits and vegetables, and that in almost every country today, the poorest part of the population can’t afford to eat five fresh fruits or vegetables a day.Although workers in countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) saw an increase in their share of national income after the second world war, that reversed in the 1980s. This was a direct consequence of anti-labour policies that scholars aptly call “wage repression”. Given consistently low wages in the neoliberal era, it mak0es sense to look at cheap food as cheap not merely relative to wage costs but directly in terms of price. When we do, it emerges as no accident that one foodstuff whose price has fallen dramatically is chicken in Mexico – a direct consequence of Nafta, technology and the US soybean industry.Nafta originally excluded agricultural goods, but they were included at the insistence of the Mexican government, which wanted to “modernise” its peasantry by moving them from agriculture into urban circuits of industry. The strategy worked: Mexico’s campesino (“peasant farmer”) agricultural economy buckled, as evinced by the El Campo No Aguanta Más (“the countryside can’t take it anymore”) protests that spread throughout the country in 2003. Circuits of migration and pools of labour for US agriculture were the result. But at least the chicken was cheap.The imagery of the frontier lends itself to thinking only about land. But the past two centuries have witnessed a very different kind of frontier movement: the enclosure of the atmospheric commons as a dumping ground for greenhouse gas emissions. In the 21st century, agriculture and forestry (which includes land clearance for cash cropping) contribute between a quarter and a third of greenhouse gas emissions.This is inevitable, because they’re profoundly energy- intensive, and have become more so. That’s a big problem, because there are no more atmospheric commons to enclose, and no obvious way to keep the costs of climate change off capitalism’s ledgers. Nowhere is this clearer than in the faltering global farm, whose productivity growth has been slowing, just as it did for English farmers in the middle of the 18th century. Agro-biotechnology’s promise of a new agricultural revolution has so far been worse than empty – failing to deliver a new yield boom, creating superweeds and superbugs that can withstand glyphosate and other poisons, and sustaining the cheap food model that is driving the ongoing state shift in the world’s climate system.There is little reason to imagine that climate change won’t break the modern food system. Worse, industrial food production is a breeding ground for pandemic disease, and reasoned analysis suggests that the kind of concentrated animal-feeding operations that bring us cheap meat will also bring viruses that could decimate the human population. Again, this is nothing new. Just as early-modern climate change and the plague brought about the end of feudalism and the beginning of capitalism, so we face a future in which climate change and a vulnerability to big systemic shocks augur a dramatic end for capitalism’s ecology.We’re astute enough students of history to see that what follows capitalism might not be better. Around the world, fascism has emerged from liberalism’s soil. Yet precisely as capitalism’s bills come due, communities are both resisting and developing complex and systemic responses at capitalism’s frontiers. Around each of the seven cheap things that make capitalism possible – nature, work, care, food, energy, money and lives – there are movements that are developing alternatives. Whether in a globally reviving labour movement, in the Movement for Black Lives’ demands around food, reparations and local economic sovereignty, or the feminismo campesino y popular (“popular peasant feminism”) developed by the La Via Campesina peasant movement in Latin America to bring together concerns around food, care, nature and work, movements are both fighting and developing intersectional alternatives.John Jordan, an activist and co-founder of the UK’s Reclaim the Streets movement, argues that resistance and alternatives are “the twin strands of the DNA of social change”. That change will need resources and space to develop. If we are made by capitalism’s ecology, then we can be remade only as we in turn practise new ways of producing and caring for one another together – a process of redoing, rethinking and reliving our most basic relations.Adapted from A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things by Raj Patel and Jason W Moore, published by Verso on 22 May, and available to buy at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03e04ea401c8b8f3038ec8dee1230bfca649cfc6/117_550_3590_2154/master/3590.jpg?w=1900\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9594976ab731c0ad072eb19cfed9accf 3800w","title":"why allow boris to grandstand his hard brexit your best comments today","story":"Reader reaction to some of the most talked about stories on site today, including Boris Johnson making Brexit headlinesWe’re highlighting some of your thoughts shared beneath key stories today, with Boris Johnson’s latest Brexit comments, a proposal to give £10,000 to millennials and student finance issues for families on the agenda.To join in the conversation you can click on the links in the comments below to expand and add your thoughts.Our politics live blog reported reaction to Johnson’s latest comments, along with No 10 declining to rebuke the foreign secretary for calling Theresa May’s Brexit customs plan “crazy”. Instead of just letting Boris grandstand his hard Brexit, why doesn’t somebody challenge him? ‘Let’s not beat around the bush, Boris: here’s the evidence of what not being in some kind of customs union will do. How about you and your hard Brexit pals bring to the table what your version of Brexit will deliver.’ No project fear, lets just have some cold hard facts about all these countries queuing up to do deals with us. We don’t want to hear the usual spewing out of meaningless percentages that you churn out.Bluemooner1Can anybody say what the point is of May keeping two solutions for the CustomsIrish border problem on the table for discussion, both of which have been rejected by the EU?One, uses non-existent technology and the EU has described it as “magical thinking”. The other, May’s favourite, involves the UK collecting tariffs for the EU, a bit like having stray Brexiteers, rather than the barperson, collecting payment for the beer at Wetherspoon’s. Understandably the EU has also described this second solution as absolutely unacceptable.And if the UK is really going to leave the customs union, as May insists it is, why is nothing being done to prepare the infrastructure at customs checkpoints and ports such as Dover?SteveinBavariaThe Resolution Foundation has proposed what it is calling a “citizen’s inheritance” to help redistribute wealth to young people. You’ve been sharing reaction beneath this opinion piece. Speaking as a millenial, I don’t want £10,000 that I can only spend on education or a house. It’s not enough for a house and I already have all the education I could possibly need. Whilst I could get a good jump on my pension, that’s not really helpful when I know even with a lump like that I’ll still likely end up having to work into my 70s anyway. What I’d really like is my public services improved. Let’s start by lowering energy prices, renationalising rail services and cutting prices. It would also really be great if some of that money could go on the homeless too, lots of them are really young and there’s so many more of them on the streets over the last few months and years. Try building some houses, proper ones not the crazy tiny nonsense being proposed.Conon98The lump sum is an absurd idea unless you fix the housing problem first. Otherwise, like Help to Buy, it will just be sucked up by higher rents and higher house prices.Really, we just need to fix housing by letting prices collapse. Then we might see some decent internal investment in something more useful than property, as well as lower house prices for millenials and lower capital gains on housing for the boomers.tomandluReaders with experience of university as students and parents have been reacting after experts attacked the government for failing to tell families they must pay up to £5,000 in living costs.The real nub of this is in the recent increases in accommodation costs. I set money aside for my child going to university this year based on the experience with their siblings - in other words what we supplemented their loans with - and added a bit. Going through the figures recently it is far from enough. Lower income families outside the threshold for extra support are the ones hard hit by this. If we are going to have loans at least make them enough to cover accommodation, food and books. Otherwise it is just more discrimination by the back door, with families like mine who are able to pay making life easier for their children by removing the need to work in term time while the less well off have to try and work alongside studying.AndreamaisieComments have been edited for length.

But he insists he would not change a thing‘I’ve had a beautiful wee life,” Eamonn Magee says soon after he has opened the front door in his dressing gown and cracked open his first beer of the day just after 11 on a Monday morning. The former boxer, who knocked down Ricky Hatton in 2002 and was a world champion when he won the WBU welterweight title, is cut and bruised from being attacked the night before.Magee’s left hand is also swollen with an obviously broken finger making him wince whenever it brushes against his can of Carling. Such pain, however, is fleeting compared with the deeper hurt that runs through him in Ardoyne, the tough Republican enclave of Belfast, where Magee’s life has been scarred by violent sectarianism, tragedy and alcoholism.“I wouldn’t change a thing,” Magee says as he takes another slug of warm beer. His battered, 46‑year‑old face crinkles and the lump under his left eye looks even more like a purple mouse as he echoes: “I’ve still had a wee beautiful life.”Magee is in trouble again because he and the writer Paul Gibson have produced a raw and riveting book which opens like this: “A book? Listen, I’ve been beaten with baseball bats, I’ve had my throat slashed, I’ve been kidnapped and exiled out of the country. I’ve been shot twice, I’ve been in prison and my son’s just been stabbed to death. Amongst all that, I was the welterweight champion of the world while drinking the bar dry and doing enough coke to kill a small horse every night. My life’s not a book. It’s a fucking movie script.”The book has caused strife and he says he has been attacked on successive nights in Ardoyne. Exception has been taken to Magee detailing many horrendous incidents, stretching from Republican politics and sectarian violence to drink and drugs, and he shakes his head when I ask how he is feeling. “It’s more embarrassing when I’m fighting,” he says softly, licking his cracked lips. “Last night I was even talking to him while defending myself. I’m punching him and saying: ‘Fuck sake, what’s this about?’”Magee waves his bust hand at me. “Who do you think came out the better?”Will Magee return to the gym? “I’m busy this week but back next Monday,” he says, defiantly.Could someone really walk in and shoot him? “What’s keeping them?” Magee says with a dark chuckle. “It’s not as if they don’t know where I live.”I had felt calm when I took the call which told me about Magee’s latest scrap. My mood remained the same in the cab rumbling through the familiar streets of Belfast, passing the old Republican murals and the high Peace Walls which still separate Catholic and Protestant communities. I even felt OK when, after I rang the bell, two pit bulls next door leapt at the fence, barking fiercely. “They’re wee nippers,” their owner warned as he pulled the dogs away.Yet it’s hard to feel serene now. Each time Magee’s phone interrupts us, with its Who Let The Dogs Out? ringtone, I scan his beaten-up face, wondering if it’s a call to tell him a paramilitary gunman is on his way. I don’t feel too hopeful at the prospect of Magee, in his dressing gown, and I talking our way out of trouble.“Why the hell would you want to shoot me?” Magee asks. “I didn’t do anything wrong.”As a way of changing the subject I point to his beer. He has been drinking since he was nine and the book makes clear he is a high‑functioning alcoholic but does he ever wish he could kick the bottle?“I tried rehab,” he eventually says, pausing again with comic timing before breaking into the Amy Winehouse song. “And I said, ‘No, no, no!’”I can’t help laughing with him before Magee continues. “I really did go to rehab and the only thing that fucked me up was that you’re not allowed TV. Not having TV was worse than no drink. You’re better off doing six months in jail.”Beneath all his scars the internal wounds have not healed. Magee tells a chilling story of how, during internment raids in the 1970s, he and his three brothers would be turned out of the two beds they shared. British soldiers marched them downstairs and they had to kneel, hands behind their heads, while their photographs were taken for no apparent reason.“Oh fuck, where are we starting?” Magee says as he remembers the impact that internment, detention without trial, had on Catholic families in the Troubles. “My dad was a through‑and‑through Republican and had a proper understanding of what the war was about. It wasn’t about bothering Protestants. The war was against the British army in Ireland. But my dad was a smashing man. The Brits imprisoned him in Long Kesh and the Irish Republicans had a bus run because in them days people couldn’t afford anything else. So we would take the bus up to Long Kesh. I was a wee nuisance and carried in letters which we’d written on cigarette papers. I folded them and hid them under my tongue.”Magee opens his mouth to show me how he did it but, sitting in his dead father’s house, I’m upset by his memory of how, once his dad had fallen out with the IRA and been banished to England, he snuck back into Ardoyne and was hidden away in his attic. Magee, his mum, Isobel, and his brothers lived in fear of his dad being discovered. They hid him in the attic for 18 months – which contributed to Magee Sr’s acute depression and alcoholism.“I didn’t get over that,” Magee says. “My mum would have a wee drink and dad would sit in there all night. I’d go in and slip him a tin or a fag. Nobody ever knew he was there.”Later, when Magee had become one of the most accomplished amateur boxers in Ireland, his father saved his career. Magee had joined the IRA’s youth wing because he loved the mayhem of rioting but he also began taking and dealing drugs. An IRA punishment shooting usually entailed being shot in the kneecap or worse but his dad reminded the paramilitaries that Eamonn was fighting in the Irish championships.“If my dad hadn’t stepped in they were talking about me getting the six-pack – elbows, knees and ankle. But my father convinced them to only give me one bullet.”How did Magee feel waiting for the knock on the door before he took a bullet in his calf? He shrugs. “It had to be dealt with. I knew it was going to be a flesh wound so hurry the fuck up. When he took me down an alleyway I asked: ‘What it’s like getting shot?’ He said: ‘Like a hot poker going in your leg.’”Who Let The Dogs Out? thumps again on cue. Magee shuts down his phone and I say it’s incredible he still won the national title a few months later. “I won but there was blood streaming down my leg from the gunshot wound.”Magee is a hard and sometimes violent man but between the ropes he was a slick southpaw who boxed with artistry. “I never bullied anybody in my life, so you can rephrase that,” he says quietly when I mention his violent infamy. “I went to the gym because I’m the baby of four and my brothers all were boxers. After a couple of years I’d see wee openings. Bing, bang. Soon as I started learning how to hit him before he hits me it was a hell of a lot easier.”Magee’s best year in the ring was in 2002 when he knocked out Jon Thaxton, a very good pro, to secure a crack at Hatton’s WBU light-welterweight title. He still drank six beers every Saturday night while training. “It was a wee prize at the end of the week but I was well prepared for Thaxton. With the Hatton camp, life was a party.”He would drive around town late at night, visiting bars and clubs, with Magee v Hatton logos splashed across his Range Rover. Three senior IRA men paid him a visit. “I don’t know why they gave me another warning. I wasn’t doing anything wrong apart from drinking and driving – and that’s nothing to do with the IRA. They told me to concentrate on training and stop partying. The main guy shook my hand and said: ‘Best of luck when you fight Ricky.’”It clearly worked in the Hatton fight because, in round one, Magee knocked down his celebrated opponent. “It was the worst punch I ever threw because I landed it after 40 seconds. Bam! But he’s 10 years my junior so of course he’s getting up when still so fresh. I wish I’d landed that punch later.”Hatton sealed a close decision but Magee won the vacant WBU welterweight title by beating a journeyman in Jimmy Vincent in December 2003. He retained his world title until May 2006 but he only had two fights in that troubled time. Magee had fallen out with a respected figure in Republican circles and, in a gruesome attack in 2004, his left leg was clubbed to a pulp. He suffered a compound fracture of his tibia and fibia, a shattered knee, and a punctured lung. They called him the Miracle Man when he returned to the ring.Magee’s legs stick out of his dressing gown and the lumps and scars provide graphic proof of that terrible beating. “It still gives me pain,” he says, balancing a beer on his knee as he studies his left leg. “The doctor thought I’d never walk again but I was in the gym a year later.”I suggest we leave the house and go for a walk around Magee’s neighbourhood. Rather than waiting inside for a knock on the door, we will be less exposed to any stray visitors. Magee agrees but, first, we remember his son who was stabbed to death in May 2015 – by the jealous ex-husband of his girlfriend. Eamonn Jr was so different to him, studying engineering at university while also boxing, and the grief becomes too much. Magee starts to cry, a muffled ache falling from his mouth as tears roll down his face.I say how sorry I am and Magee squeezes my hand only to curse the pain in his broken finger, before wiping his eyes. We talk about his book and, of the title, he says: “The Lost Soul was beautiful. My mother called me a lost soul and she was right.”Magee goes upstairs to get dressed. When he returns, wearing a hat straight out of Peaky Blinders, he almost looks dapper. The old fighter sinks the dregs of his beer. We walk outside and Magee takes me on a tour of the murals. Afterwards he hugs me in the street, calling me a gentleman and a scholar, even if I can’t stay for a lunchtime drink. Magee lifts his broken hand in a stately wave as my taxi drives away. I check my recording in the back of the cab and Magee’s ghostly voice echoes again as we drive through Belfast: “I’ve seen things not many people have seen but if they hadn’t happened I wouldn’t be the man I am today. So I wouldn’t change a thing. I’m more than happy with my wee life.”The Lost Soul of Eamonn Magee by Paul Gibson is available at www.bookshop"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b839fd371e4c254948a71a0f8712332dfda05bba/112_78_2611_1566/master/2611.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1af8e30c6fa5abf02cf5c95afe333de","title":"the spin ed smith england contenders cricket test team","story":"Like the cuckoo, the new chief selector has been spotted this spring. He has been migrating north and west (it’s the only way to go from where he lives) to soak up some county cricket, to chat to the coaches, the umpires and the odd senior player as he reacquaints himself with the domestic circuit.Ed Smith knows that the easiest time to make an impact as a selector, heralding a vibrant new regime, is at the start of a season. After that, as Harold Macmillan probably didn’t say, “stuff happens”. The borderline selection, whom you don’t really rate, scores a lucky century the one you really hold in high esteem bags a pair and the course is set. But for the first Test of a summer a selector is not so restricted. There is scope to trust one’s instincts.Andrew Strauss has pointed out that “Ed comes with fresh ideas”, which is clearly true. When I have sat alongside him in a commentary box interesting theories come to light as frequently as pigeons used to when Henry Blofeld was at the microphone. Upon announcing Smith as his chief selector, Strauss added: “There is real depth to his talent identification knowledge.” I will try to interpret as best I can. Strauss may have meant “he knows a good cricketer when he sees one” or he may have been hinting at a highly sophisticated, innovative scientificmathematicalpsychological system of assessing players who might excel for England. We’ll see.The impetus for some sort of change to the Test team is considerable. Throughout the winter England played seven Tests, losing five and drawing two. In these circumstances it would seem odd for a new selector – or an old one for that matter – to pick all the familiar names. However, it is not obvious which way Smith can go to invigorate the side.At the start of the season the data often seems skewed. In the first few rounds of this year’s Championship wickets have usually tumbled on damp, green pitches so that runs count double, while the value of a pile of wickets, mostly taken by 80mph seamers, can be halved. In the last round of matches on drier, sun-drenched surfaces the batsmen started to enjoy themselves a bit. But have the right men prospered for Smith?With the Lord’s Test just over a fortnight away, there are, I think, only five absolute certainties assuming all are fit (Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow, Ben Stokes, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson). You may have spotted a glaring absentee on this list, an opening batsman of unprecedented experience, and that is where we start.Openers All the candidates are left-handed and I acknowledge that the senior one, Alastair Cook, is a very strong probable. But it is good to keep him guessing. Over the years the great players demonstrate a highly-tuned survival instinct. They manage to conjure something whenever their career is jeopardised. So it may be helpful to put Cook on notice (moreover, in the winter in 15 Test innings he only managed to exceed 37 once – when he scored 244 not out in Melbourne). Mark Stoneman, by his own candid admission, has not done enough to nail down a place, though his last Test innings was a career-best 60. Rory Burns, his partner at Surrey, where batsmen tend to prosper, has scored some runs, while Keaton Jennings, after a poor start at Lancashire, has just hit a century at Old Trafford, where Haseeb Hameed has just been dropped. Another fancied left-hander, Middlesex’s Nick Gubbins, posted a century at Hove.Middle order In Christchurch it was James Vince, Root and Dawid Malan. Of these Vince is the most vulnerable despite scoring 76 in his last Test innings. One of Vince’s attractions is that he is used to batting at No3, which Root is reluctant to do. But how he exasperates. Other contenders, such as Liam Livingstone of Lancashire and Dan Lawrence of Essex, rarely bat so high for their counties. Worcestershire’s Joe Clarke has just struck 157 batting at No4 at the powderpuff Oval after a poor start to the summer. We can now proceed more quickly.All-rounder Barring accidents we fall back on Stokes with a caveat over whether he is capable of bowling 15 overs a day with a red ball. This spring he has not been able to take the IPL by storm.Wicketkeeper More certainty, I think. There is Jonny Bairstow, unless Smith suggests sending him up the order as a specialist batsman. However Bairstow is adamant that he should keep the gloves – and it was somehow uplifting to see him standing up at Chelmsford not only to Steve Patterson but also Ben Coad.Pacemen Who joins Anderson and Broad? They tried Mark Wood at Christchurch instead of Chris Woakes with little success. Both have been languishing on the sidelines in the IPL in the past fortnight. Craig Overton has been doing his duty for Somerset but the fast ones tend to be off-target. Olly Stone of Warwickshire flickered when taking eight for 80 against Sussex but then injury concerns resurfaced. Jake Ball with 25 and Coad (23) are the leading wicket-takers in the Division One. The selectors may just hope that Woakes is rejuvenated by the presence of a devilish, dark Duke in his hand.Spinners Until recently Moeen Ali has been hiding in India, Jack Leach in Taunton, though England’s latest Test player was in action for Somerset this week on an Old Trafford featherbed. He is an improving cricketer (he top-scored to save the game against Lancashire) and a competent left-arm spinner. Leach’s cause is helped considerably if Stokes is fit to bowl. And look out for Surrey’s Amar Virdi, patiently.Verdict They could easily pick the same crew. That might be Trevor Bayliss’s preference, but not Smith’s. This will be an interesting meeting of minds.• This is an extract taken from The Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

Pearce was carrying a bag crammed with plastic stumps and bats, and when the kids saw it one asked if Pearce was going to teach them\u0026nbsptennis.Lynnfield is close by Victoria Park, home of the town’s football team, and if the kids there played anything at all then that was the sport. Pearce is a wicketkeeper himself, and a good one. He played for Durham’s second XI, came through their academy with Ben Stokes. But he didn’t mention it. There was no point. Most of the children didn’t even recognise a cricket bat, let alone know who used them.Pearce works for the Lord’s Taverners Wicketz programme, which is designed to bring the game to young children in deprived urban areas. There are 16 Wicketz projects running around the country. Hartlepool is Pearce’s beat. He has all the trappings of a coach, the tracksuit, kit, and plastic cones, but watching him work on a Tuesday afternoon he seems more like a big brother than another teacher. He treats them with affectionate exasperation, and has a jocular, joshing authority. Which works, because Wicketz is not about teaching kids to keep their elbows high when they play a cover drive.The Wicketz classes are free and open to everyone between eight and 16. When Pearce started them he had to run separate sessions for the kids from south Asian backgrounds and everyone else. But over time he brought the two groups together.“It took a few weeks,” he says. “The kids wanted to stay in their own groups, they’d say: ‘Why do we have to mix?’ and: ‘We don’t want to.’ I kept telling them we were trying to build a team.” They had a few drop out, but not as many as they had join in when the sessions were finally integrated.There was tension. In those early mixed classes, Pearce had to walk some of the children home afterwards because the rows between the two groups were so bad. He does a lot of pastoral work like this. At Wicketz they often fit in classes around cricket. They try to target them to the needs of the regions they are working in. Early on, Pearce found that some of his kids were binge drinking, after a 14-year-old boy told him that he’d had to have his stomach pumped, so they have been doing work on alcohol awareness.They’ve had talks on diet, nutrition and social media, too. Just little five-minute lectures, short and sharp, before the kids get back to whacking the soft balls around. In Hartlepool there’s a real problem with youth unemployment, and the Wicketz national manager, Dan Wilson, wants to tailor the programme towards that. He is one of the great enthusiasts. As soon as it has occurred to him that some of the older kids might want to help out with the coaching, he’s over talking to them, telling them that if they want to participate they can earn new qualifications for their CVs.On the day I’m there, they are already at it. Some of the older Asian kids are helping the younger white ones with their grips. There must be 35 children altogether, a real mix, boys and girls, all ages and backgrounds. Lynnfield’s playing area is the only green space in the district, so the school keeps it open to everyone during daylight hours. A lot of people, many of them former pupils, pop along to watch. The deputy head, Kate McIntyre, is one of them. “This is my kind of charity,” she says, “because it’s run by people who are invested in our community. They’re here every week, making an\u0026nbspimpact.”These days, McIntyre says, cricket is as popular as football at the school. “Every day now they’re playing cricket up against the wall, and they’re always pestering us: ‘When’s Cole coming, when can we play again?’”Wicketz is not going to fix Hartlepool’s problems with stumps and plastic bats but Pearce is here three times a week, every week, trying to help.

Herzberg was pushing a bicycle across the road outside of a crossing. She later died from her injuries.Although the car’s sensors detected Herzberg, its software which decides how it should react was tuned too far in favour of ignoring objects in its path which might be “false positives” (such as plastic bags), according to a report from the Information. This meant the modified Volvo XC90 did not react fast enough.The report also said the human safety driver was not paying close enough attention to intervene before the vehicle struck the pedestrian.Arizona suspended Uber’s self-driving vehicle testing after the incident. The company later settled with Herzberg’s family.Uber and the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are investigating the incident. Uber has already reached its preliminary conclusion, according to the report. A comprehensive NTSB report is expected later.“We’re actively cooperating with the NTSB in their investigation. Out of respect for that process and the trust we’ve built with NTSB, we can’t comment on the specifics of the incident,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement. “In the meantime, we have initiated a top-to-bottom safety review of our self-driving vehicles programme, and we have brought on former NTSB chair Christopher Hart to advise us on our overall safety culture. Our review is looking at everything from the safety of our system to our training processes for vehicle operators, and we hope to have more to say soon.”The collision marked the first fatality attributed to a self-driving car, the development of which has frequently been labelled as the only way to eliminate road deaths for those inside and outside the car.The incident was not the first controversy to involve Uber’s self-driving efforts, which the company sees as key to its survival as a ride-sharing or taxi firm. The company has been involved in a long-running battle with former Google self-driving car outfit Waymo over theft of technology around Anthony Levandowski. Uber’s self-driving technology was also called 5,000 times worse than Waymo’s in an independent analysis in 2017, while it has had legal tussles with various US states where it has tried to test vehicles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75f9ca9d670a2733ad8c26b008307edf45b11a29/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90157647d126df42557d45ae53fcc76e","title":"swipe left why dating shows have become irrelevant","story":"The announcement of a new TV show based on a Snapchat dating concept is the latest nail in the coffin of a genre that doesn’t have a place in an online dating-focused worldToday in hellish sentences I never thought I’d write, a Snapchat dating show is coming to television. Phone Swap, which currently gets 10 million viewers on Snapchat Discover, will run on select Fox stations later this year.The premise of Phone Swap is simple. Potential love interests decide whether or not to date each other based on the contents of their phones. Theoretically, it’s a potentially gripping premise. Will she love you if she discovers your Barry Manilow Spotify playlists? Will she love you if she opens your banking app and realises that you’re destitute? Will she love you after reading all the nightmarish murder lists you’ve drawn up in the middle of the night on Notes?However, I suspect two things will stop Phone Swap from becoming a success. First, it’s a dating show about millennials looking at each others’ phones, so it might as well just be called Hey Everyone, Here’s What My Penis Looks Like. And second, it’s yet another gimmicky dating show in a field littered with gimmicky dating shows.The problem with all of these shows is that they’re not really dating shows. Over the years, the joy of watching two people fall in love – whether it’s an instant click of chemistry or a slow-burn surge of affection – has given way to a carnival of humiliation. Dating is just a veneer that these shows use to plumb the depths of human discomfiture. You don’t watch The Bachelorette because you believe in the purity of love you watch it to see a bunch of Donald Jr boneheads present their worst selves to the world. And you’re not going to watch Phone Swap to see the magical moment when two people realise that they need each other in their lives you’re going to watch it for the mortifying moment when a woman realises that a stranger keeps stalking his ex on Facebook.To my mind, the reason why dating shows have fallen into this cul-de-sac of cruelty is because the form has already been perfected. And it was perfected five and a half decades ago. The Dating Game remains the essence of everything all dating shows aspire to be. One dater, a few aspiring datees, a handful of questions and a crusading belief in the power of love, and that was all. In the UK, The Dating Game became Blind Date, in which previous couples would return to the show to dissect everything that had worked and failed during their time together. This, thanks to host Cilla Black’s palpable disappointment whenever a relationship crashed and burned, made it the Abbey Road of dating shows. It couldn’t last forever, because the sheer force of grinding repetition was bound to kill it in the end. But it was pure, and everything since has simply been a slapdash Xerox.But I could be wrong. Perhaps Phone Swap will become the new gold standard of dating show. I’d even be happy if it was. Anything that permanently derails The Bachelorette, I’m all for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b3bce5d673963343ddc993ea9c3d8311c64189b/392_12_3022_1814/master/3022.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e29cdf8d13d7b49883aa6405e292ef4b","title":"gina haspel cia director atone past","story":"Senate confirmation hearing will focus on documents relating to interrogation techniques used inside a secret prison in ThailandThe battle in the Senate on Wednesday over Gina Haspel’s confirmation as the new director of the CIA is set to become a public reckoning of one of the darker chapters in modern US history.Haspel, who is currently the CIA’s deputy director after 33 years in the agency, ran a secret detention centre in Thailand in 2002 where inmates were tortured. Over the following two years she was a senior operations officer at the CIA counter-terrorism centre, which oversaw the interrogation programme around the world. Then, in 2005, she drafted an order for her then boss, Jose Rodriguez, the head of the CIA clandestine service, calling for the destruction of nearly 100 videotapes of interrogation sessions.Despite strong support from former CIA chiefs, Haspel’s chances of becoming the agency’s first female boss are delicately balanced in a ided Senate. Senators had demanded greater transparency from the CIA over her history and on Monday the agency delivered a cardboard box full of classified documents. But it is unclear what those documents will prove, and they may raise more questions than answers. The New York Times reported that the White House has seen newly released documentation including records of chats in the CIA’s internal messaging system in which Haspel raises no objections to the CIA’s interrogation techniques. After being summoned to the White House on Friday to discuss the new information, Haspel is reported to have offered to withdraw, uncertain over the administration’s commitment to backing her. She had to be talked out of quitting by senior presidential aides, including the legislative director, Marc Short, and White House spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, who was urgently dispatched to the CIA headquarters in Langley to bolster Haspel’s resolve. “She wants to do everything she can to make sure the integrity of the CIA remains intact, isn’t unnecessarily attacked,” Sanders said on Monday, when asked about Haspel’s apparent crisis of confidence over the weekend. “If she felt that her nomination would have been a problem for that and for the agency, then she wanted to do everything she could to protect the agency.”In an effort to boost her standing ahead of the Senate confirmation hearings, Trump sent out a tweet that celebrated rather than downplayed Haspel’s role in the “enhanced interrogation” programme that included waterboarding – the simulated drowning of detainees.  “My highly respected nominee for CIA director, Gina Haspel, has come under fire because she was too tough on terrorists,” Trump declared. “Think of that, in these very dangerous times, we have the most qualified person, a woman, who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror.”  The Senate battle over Haspel will be the focus for protests on Capitol Hill by human rights activists who see her ascent as evidence that there has been no real reckoning in the intelligence agencies for the excesses of the Bush administration’s “war on terror”.  Haspel herself is expected to say she has learned from past mistakes and would not go along with any future order to use waterboarding, sleep deprivation and other forms of torture.  At the heart of Wednesday confirmation hearing will be an examination of what happened in Detention Site Green, a secret prison in Thailand which Haspel briefly ran in 2002 her role in overseeing interrogation while running the agency’s counter-terrorism centre in the two years after that and how much say she had in a decision to destroy interrogation videotapes without the explicit assent of the CIA leadership or congressional oversight committees. The CIA itself has conducted an unusual lobbying campaign on Haspel’s behalf, reflecting the agency’s desire to have an insider in charge rather than risk a political appointee. CIA veterans would also see her confirmation as a sign that the agency had been officially absolved of its misdeeds in the war on terror.  John Brennan, CIA chief under the Obama administration, used Twitter to appeal for her confirmation by sceptical Democrats.  Furthermore, Haspel is seen as a Russia expert and a close ally of Britain’s MI6, having being London station chief from 2014 to 2017. She is reported to have insisted on the forceful US response in solidarity with the UK, to the poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, using a nerve agent that is alleged to have originated from Russian government laboratories. CIA insiders hope that Haspel will insulate the agency from Trump’s indulgent approach to Vladimir Putin. But to achieve that Haspel will have to prove on Wednesday that she, and the agency she seeks to run, have atoned for their past.

I don’t take offense at that.”Pelosi, who served as the first female speaker of the House from 2007 to 2011, has increasingly become a target for Republicans as more visible party leaders such as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton receded from the public stage. Already this year Republicans have spent millions of dollars in attack ads and messaging focused on Pelosi. Republicans seized on her comments that corporate bonuses of $1,000 paid to workers from the $1.5tn GOP tax plan amounted to “crumbs” and have hammered Democratic candidates by accusing them of being Pelosi acolytes. “I have made some very powerful enemies,” Pelosi said, explaining how she became a GOP bogeyman. There are signs that an anti-Pelosi strategy is a gamble for Republicans. In a recent Pennsylvania special election, Republican organizations spent millions of dollars on TV advertising and campaign material tying Democrat Conor Lamb to the House minority leader, derisively attacking him as “Pelosi’s little Lamb”. Lamb, who vowed early that he would not support Pelosi to lead House Democrats, won the race in a stunning upset by less than 1,000 votes. Weeks later, Republican Debbie Lesko won the special election in a deeply conservative district of Arizona by only six points. Like in Pennsylvania, Republicans cast the Democrat as a Pelosi acolyte. The Democrat, Hiral Tipirneni, who is running again for the seat in November, would not commit to supporting Pelosi for speaker in an interview with the . During the roughly 45-minute Politico interview at the Liaison Hotel in Washington, Pelosi dismissed calls for impeachment of Donald Trump as a “distraction” from Democrats’ economic message, which she admitted was already struggling to break through. “Impeachment, to me, is a isive issue,” Pelosi said, “unless there’s something as conclusive as what we saw in Watergate. That was inevitable. That was bipartisan.”She continued: “You can talk about it in your districts. In my district, it’s a very popular issue. But it takes attention away from the connection we need to make to people about their economic security.”Pelosi said she had planned to step aside as leader after Hillary Clinton won the election. But when Clinton lost, Pelosi said she felt compelled to remain in the role so that there was a “woman at the table”. “That became very important to me, that there would be a woman at the table where these decisions are negotiated,” she said. Despite calls for Pelosi – and the whole bench of Democratic leaders – to step aside and allow a new generation to assume power, she has so far resisted. On Tuesday Pelosi defended herself as a prolific fundraiser and a “legislative virtuoso”. “I say this because I want women to take pride in what they are,” she said. When asked what she would do if Democrats did not regain control of the House, Pelosi demurred. “I can’t even think of not winning,” she said. “You have to believe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d923a1b967a417403fea3166a84a4b4adfdbeac/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3baa62f4a694f58c753f9f72a9dfd80","title":"hawaiis kilauea volcano erupts in pictures","story":"The eruption of Kilauea volcano has sent lava flowing into residential areas on Hawaii’s Big Island, with residents ordered to abandon their homes.

Names mentioned in the Italian media on Tuesday included Elisabetta Belloni, the foreign ministry’s secretary general, and Marta Cartabia, the deputy head of the constitutional court. There is also speculation that Lucrezia Reichlin, an economist, Anna Maria Tarantola, a former director of the Bank of Italy and former president of the national broadcaster Rai, and Fabiola Gianotti, the first female director of the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), are in the running. Carlo Cottarelli, a former executive director at the International Monetary Fund, is among the male candidates named.“It is a way to appeal to public opinion. The majority of the Italian population is female, but until now this hasn’t corresponded with representation in the political system. So I think there is an idea – not PR, as that would be too cheap – to enlarge representation while providing a sort of exit strategy from the crisis, and one that could change the discourse.”After his nominee is sworn into office he or she will face a parliamentary vote of confidence, which would be likely to take place next week. Only the centre-left Democratic party backs Mattarella’s plan for a technocratic government, and if the selected premier fails the confidence vote, then Mattarella would need to dissolve parliament with elections to follow.“Proposing elections on 8 July would be a nightmare,” said Catia Polidori, an MP with Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia, a partner in the centre-right alliance.“People won’t vote, they’ll be at the beach. But Italians don’t want a technocratic government. We need to respect their vote.

Pashinyan has offered assurances that he will not break with the Kremlin. It has been an unlikely rise to power in the post-Soviet republic of about 3 million for the former newspaper editor. Before April, the ruling Republican party’s stranglehold on Armenian politics had appeared intact, with Sargsyan newly installed as prime minister after term limits forced him to step down as president after 10 years.But governance changes that in tandem bolstered the prime minister’s office led to accusations that Sargsyan had manipulated the constitution to cling to power. Pashinyan and other activists brought out tens of thousands of people on to the streets for protests that paralysed the capital, Yerevan. Sargsyan resigned on 23 April in a stunning concession to the opposition. Pashinyan, who had been detained and then released from jail during the protests, called for snap elections to choose a new “people’s prime minister”.Supporters say Pashinyan, who was also imprisoned after opposition rallies in 2008 turned deadly, is among history’s great peaceful revolutionaries. “You can absolutely compare him with historical figures like Gandhi and Nelson Mandela,” said Eduard Aghajanyan, a city council member from Pashinyan’s Civil Contract party, and one of Pashinyan’s young, western-educated advisers.It has been a dangerous road for Pashinyan. He was expelled from university in 1995 for his political activities, and faced libel charges as the editor-in-chief of Haykakan Zhamanak in 2000. His car was blown up in an apparent assassination attempt in 2004, and in 2008 he spent months in hiding after being accused of instigating political protests that ended with 10 people dead. He was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2010 but was released the following year under an amnesty.He has publicly fallen out with other opposition leaders such as the former president Levon Ter-Petrosyan. In private, detractors say Pashinyan is a novice when it comes to working in government and unwilling to compromise. He entered parliament in 2016 as a member of a coalition of opposition parties.“The main question is whether Nikol Pashinyan the revolutionary can become Nikol Pashinyan the prime minister,” said Emil Danielyan, a journalist and political analyst in Yerevan. He has a flair for the theatrical. Last month Pashinyan told Sargsyan in face-to-face discussions that he had “come to discuss your resignation”. Sargsyan called the demand “political blackmail” and walked out of negotiations.Pashinyan has however shown a deft political touch over the past month, running a gauntlet of thorny political questions including whether Armenia should maintain close ties with Russia and whether there should be a purge of former ruling party officials and a criminal trial into the deaths of protesters in 2008.In an interview with the  during the protests, Pashinyan said dark political forces had been trying to derail Armenia’s peaceful revolution. His aides said Karen Karapetyan, the prime minister from September 2016 until last month, and who is close to Russia, had sought backroom deals to derail a vote last week for Pashinyan to become PM, which he lost. “Some forces are trying to engage us into political bargaining and propose me to become prime minister but ensure and guarantee the continuation of the existing system,” Pashinyan said. “And for me, my goal isn’t to become prime minister. My goal is bring real changes to Armenia.”He spoke of plans to further open Armenia to foreign business and break the control over certain industries held by businessmen close to the previous regime. Still, he and his supporters have largely skirted policy discussions in favour of rallying cries for reform in the poor country of about 3 million people, which borders Turkey and Iran and is locked in a simmering territorial conflict with another neighbour, Azerbaijan. There is a touch of the populist in Pashinyan – he has donned a camouflage T-shirt for some speeches, but returned to a suit for negotiations with other parties. “He is not a populist. He is popular,” said Ararat Mirzoyan, a fellow member of Civil Contract, who was arrested with Pashinyan last month.Mirzoyan said he had seen Pashinyan grow as a leader in recent years as the two worked together in parliament. Asked about the party’s specific policies, he said: “Only once we achieve fundamental reforms can we begin talking about the changes for the future sector by sector.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc9f41dd42dc35c2666d6e2cebbd6d8917573b4d/0_323_1986_1191/master/1986.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0259898d7d2c3f11e035efedb51fe74a","title":"kim jong un meets xi jinping in second surprise visit to china","story":"North Korean leader and Chinese president in flurry of diplomacy as Kim prepares for summit with Donald TrumpThe North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has made a second surprise visit to China to meet its president, Xi Jinping, amid a flurry of diplomacy as Kim prepares for a summit with Donald Trump.Kim flew to the Chinese port city of Dalian and held talks “in a cordial and friendly atmosphere” with Xi over two days before returning to Pyongyang on Tuesday, China’s state news agency Xinhua said in announcing the trip. It is the second meeting between the two leaders in about 40 days, and was kept secret until Kim had left China. Shortly after the summit was reported, Trump said on Twitter he would speak to Xi by phone about North Korea, where he said “relationships and trust are building”.Kim and Xi discussed relations between their two countries as well as “major issues of common concern”, and Kim restated Pyongyang’s desire to relinquish its nuclear arsenal.“It has been the DPRK’s consistent and clear stand to achieve denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,” Kim said, using the acronym for North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, according to paraphrased remarks reported by Xinhua. “As long as relevant parties abolish their hostile policies and remove security threats against the DPRK, there is no need for the DPRK to be a nuclear state and denuclearisation can be realised.”It was not immediately clear what security threats Kim was referring to, but experts have said North Korea may push for the removal of some or all of the 28,000 US soldiers currently stationed in South Korea. The meeting comes as Kim prepares to meet Trump, who has said the date and location of the summit is fixed but has yet to make details public.“I hope to build mutual trust with the US through dialogue,” Kim was quoted as saying. He said he hoped to take “phased and synchronous measures” in order to “eventually achieve” a formal peace treaty with Seoul – the two neighbours are still technically in a state of war – and a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.The statement seemed to be at odds with demands from the US, which has called on North Korea to immediately disarm.Although Kim’s meeting was reported in North Korean media, his remarks on denuclearisation were noticeably absent. Kim travelled to Dalian by plane, in a public and telling break with his father’s traditional means of travel – he insisted on only using an armoured train due to a fear of flying. China has been angling to retain its influence over its ally amid the recent rapprochement between North and South Korea, and Kim’s desire to directly engage with the US. Kim and Xi have had a frosty relationship since Kim came to power in 2011, only meeting for the first time in late March. That was Kim’s first official trip outside North Korea when he travelled to Beijing in a bullet-proof train.“China is willing to continue to work with all relevant parties and play an active role in comprehensively advancing the process of peaceful resolution of the peninsula issue through dialogue, and realising long-term peace and stability in the region,” Xi said.The meeting between the two men comes as the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, is set to travel to Tokyo for meetings with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzō Abe, and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in.Moon hosted Kim during a historic one-day summit in April, marking the first time a leader from North Korea had set foot in the South since the end of the 1950-53 Korean war. The two leaders agreed to work towards the goal of “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula” in a joint statement that capped the cordial meeting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbcfee5c5ef7cd9fd805b2311939911ac693abbc/0_396_3348_2009/master/3348.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8472b8d07149a1893da0879e3221c1c5","title":"tamam opponents top twitter in bid to topple turkeys erdogan","story":"Rivals respond to president’s offer to stand aside if country says ‘enough’ in June electionThe Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has vowed to step down if his people decide they have had “enough”, prompting opponents to propel the word in Turkish, tamam, to the top of worldwide Twitter trends.Erdoğan will contest a presidential election on 24 June, seeking to extend his 15 years in power which began when he became the prime minister in 2003 and continued with his move to the presidency in 2014.His ruling party is confident of victory in the polls but the country remains polarised.Speaking to his Justice and Development party in Ankara on Tuesday, Erdoğan said his foes “have just one care – to destroy Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. If, one day, our nation says ‘enough’, then we will move to the side,” he said, referring to himself in the first person plural.Opponents rapidly seized on the word and turned it into the top Twitter trend around the world, with more than 450,000 tweets by Tuesday afternoon.Some simply tweeted the word in bold letters with spaces – T A M A M – while others added slogans and gifs.Others wrote the word as many times as possible within Twitter’s character limit, or made fancy shapes with its letters. The word was also rapidly seized upon by Erdoğan’s rivals who will face him in the poll and seek to force a run-off.Denounced by his opponents as an authoritarian leader, Erdoğan says he has brought Turkey to a new level of economic prosperity and foreign policy influence.While there is strong hostility towards him on the Aegean coast, some Kurdish areas and parts of Istanbul and Ankara, he retains widespread and enthusiastic support in the Anatolian core of the country.Erdoğan said Turkish people had always given the right response to those who sought to destroy him, recalling the failed 2016 coup.

Photograph: Caitriona O’KennedyLarge numbers of people drinking alcohol along Dublin’s Grand Canal during good weather is “something we cannot allow to continue”, a local councillor has said. Hundreds of people gathered around Charlemont Bridge and Portobello Harbour over the Bank Holiday weekend enjoying temperatures of 23 degrees, the highest recorded so far this year. Labour councillor Mary Freehill, who lives along the Grand Canal, said she was contacted by a number of local residents regarding litter left behind and people urinating in public. “It does require a much more co-ordinated effort on the part of the gardai and to recognise that it is an issue that actually has to be dealt with,” she told The . “There’s been drugs there as well, I’m afraid. What really concerns me about this is when you have a group of people consuming a lot of alcohol around very deep water, people may not realise that is an accident waiting to happen. It’s something we cannot allow to continue.” Cllr Freehill said she has been in contact with local gardai and is due to raise the issue at the Dublin South East area committee next week. Sinn Fein councillor Chris Andrews said “whenever the sun shines it’s a problem”. “There’s no overnight solution, we’re going to have to put a strategy in place to address it and redevelop it so there is infrastructure there for people who are social drinking and enjoying the scenery,” he said. “The gardai, Dublin City Council, Waterways Ireland, people themselves have to be more aware and more proactive. “The area looks like it has a hangover this morning, like a lot of the people who were drinking there.”Cllr Andrews said some of the possibilities being considered are temporary portaloos though this remains “unpopular”. “Dublin City Council street cleaning team hose down the entire area the following morning. They put out extra bins which aren’t aesthetically pleasing but they’re functional. Even then, people throw them into the canal when they get drunk. It is very difficult to address. “Obviously the businesses can’t cope and you wouldn’t expect them to. I know they already do a lot of cleaning up above and beyond their own business.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3487935.1525785257!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tofu maker gets closure order after rodents found at premises","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tInspectors found ‘extensive’ mice and rat droppings at an organic tofu maker in north DublinAn organic tofu maker in north Dublin was served with a closure order last month after live rodents were found at its premises. Natural Green - located in the Stadium Business Park, Ballycoolin, Dublin 15 - was ordered to close on April 12th after inspectors also found “extensive” mice and rat droppings. The order has not been lifted. The inspectors observed gnawing of food packaging and droppings and hair on food packaging. They also found droppings on food-contact equipment, machinery and food debris. “This poses a grave and immediate danger to public health as the above conditions may cause a serious risk of contamination with pathogenic bacteria and foreign matter such as rodent droppings,” the inspection report said. “The presence of live rodents were noted in the immediate environs to the front and rear of the premises.” The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) said six closure orders were served in April. Two of those are under appeal. Closure orders were also issued on a food business at the Demesne, Shrule, Co Mayo the kitchen and food preparation area of Bentleys Hotel in Kilkenny a slaughterhouse and cutting plant in Corcreaghy, Co Louth (under appeal) and Keyaki Japanese restaurant in Ennis, Co Clare. Orders issued on Bentleys Hotel and Keyaki Japanese have since been lifted. Inspectors at Keyaki Japanese restaurant said food was not stored in a safe and hygienic manner in its coldroom. “A cardboard box, containing defrosting chicken, was stored on the floor of the coldroom, resulting in blood leaching onto the coldroom floor,” the inspection report said. It also said boiled rice was being cooked and cooled on a table in the wash up area. “There was no evidence available to show that the rice was being cooled as quickly as possible. Rice which is not cooled and reheated at the correct temperature can result in the growth and survival of pathogenic bacteria, which have the potential to cause illness,” it said. Inspectors at Bentleys Hotel said wall surfaces in the cooking and food preparation areas were unclean with evidence of mould growth. They also said blood was dripping from raw meat stored in a standalone fridge onto the floor. FSAI chief executive Dr Pamela Byrne said: “If it if a food business handling andor processing foods of animal origin, it is illegal to operate without approval by the relevant authority before commencing trade. Working in partnership with the food safety inspectors, we have zero tolerance for those not operating legally,” Dr Byrne said. “It is a legal requirement for all food businesses to have their premises kept clean and pest proofed however each month, inspectors are finding recurring incidents of filthy premises and rodent infestations. “Each inidual food business must take responsibility and commit to ensuring high food safety standards and compliance with the lawm,” she said.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsThe insertion of the Eighth Amendment into the Constitution was a “catastrophic mistake” and has caused “endless suffering and heartache”, a former Fine Gael minister has said.Gemma Hussey, who was minister for education when the amendment was introduced after a referendum in 1983, was among the speakers at the launch of the Grandparents for Repeal campaign on Tuesday.Ms Hussey said “nobody” had been discussing abortion in the turbulent political years of the early 1980s but it became a central issue after booklets were circulated alleging certain politicians and candidates were “soft on abortion”.She said thousands of such brochures were distributed in her Wicklow constituency at the time.“We never found out who printed those brochures,” she said, adding that she had two daughters, a son and seven grandchildren – three girls and four boys\u0026nbsp– and, for their sake, was voting Yes.Grandparents for Repeal is advocating for a Yes vote in the May 25th referendum on repealing the amendment, which guarantees an equal right to the life to the mother and the unborn.Former Labour TD and minister of state Liz McManus, who also served in the Wicklow constituency, said she had grown up in the Ireland of the 1950s, when we “exported” jobless young people and then the State forgot about them.“Single pregnant women disappeared to England to hide their shame. The country I grew up in did not tolerate difference. Thankfully it is a changed place now,” she said.Ms McManus said proponents of the amendment had promised it would stop abortion.“It didn’t. It drove it underground. It has caused untold hardship and distress at a time when women are at their most vulnerable.”She said the Oireachtas had made decisions “without ever having heard from the women who were – and are – central to the debate”.Retired Supreme Court judge Catherine McGuinness said she was looking at the campaign as a lawyer, but she added that grandparents had “life experience” too.“We as grandparents have actually learned a few things in this life. It is for people of all generations to look at the reality of life. We have abortion in this country but in an Irish solution to an Irish problem way.”Ms McGuinness said the choice on May 25th was “not between abortion and no abortion”.“The choice is between having a proper system rather than having a system where we pretend this isn’t happening.”Carol Hunter, founder of Grandparents for Repeal, said the Eighth Amendment affected women’s health “in the most basic way”.“As a grandparent, where the role is to support and nurture and protect, so we can’t go on like this. This is an opportunity to show the world we care, that we are loving.”"},{"url":null,"title":"peston ireland has undermined britain for over 100 years","story":"  May 6, 2018TV presenter Robert Peston makes the claim during interview with Jacob Rees-Mogg "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3487892.1525783638!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cabinet hears calls from three ministers for tony o brien resignation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTony O’Brien has faced calls to resign over the cervical cancer scandal.Pressure is growing on Tony O’Brien to resign as HSE chief over the cervical cancer scandal after three Government Ministers told a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday they believed he should step down.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3488035.1525789254!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british voters want things to change but largely stay the same","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May speaks to party supporters at Sedgley Conservative Club in Dudley last week ahead of local elections. Photograph: Anthony Devlin via ReutersFor anyone who grew up in the Age of Landslides that was fin de millénaire Britain, the spectacle of a close election has a freakish novelty. Yet this is the way of things now.Thirteen years, three general elections and a financial crash have passed since the public gave a prime minister a handsome majority in the House of Commons. Two of those elections returned no majority at all. To judge by last week’s votes in English local authorities, neither the Conservatives nor the Labour Party can count on forming a powerful government in the near future.While “ stalemate “ has emerged as the journalistic shorthand for this new dispensation, it is not quite right. Someone has to govern, and the Tories tend to scrape enough votes to do it. Stalemate also implies something of a passive electorate: two parties locked in mutual nullification like chess grandmasters while voters ooh and aah from the auditorium.More likely, what we are living through is not stalemate but weak government by popular design. The British public has improvised through its votes what the American founders hard-wired into their republic’s constitutional architecture: the extreme difficulty of doing all that much in office. One election result could be an accident. It is the consistency of the pattern over the past decade that is so telling. The mood of voters amounts to a kind of constructive indecision. The mystery is what to read into it.Over recent years the idea that Britain wants dramatic change – of a populist, eat-the-rich flavour – has hardened from a plausible theory into a given. As a result, it increasingly goes unscrutinised. If the vote for Brexit proved a wider national readiness for change, you would expect it to tally with electoral results before and since. To an extent that cannot be down to random error, it does not.For a country that demands rupture with a “failed” liberalism, Britain keeps returning parliaments that guarantee – at most – cautious, tinkering amendments to the status quo. Even the referendum was followed, a year later, by a general election that has more or less nixed the hardest version of Brexit as a legislative goer.As she tries to sell the idea of a “customs partnership” with the EU to more strident ministers, Theresa May’s most persuasive argument has nothing to do with the internal merits of her plan. Instead, the prime minister points her colleagues to the arithmetical realities of parliament. If denied a compromise, it might vote for full customs union membership.Excitable Leavers will have this down as sabotage of the people’s will. But the people had a wonderful chance to express themselves a year ago. They could have signed off on a Tory win that made a formality of hard exit. Instead, they returned MPs to take the edge off their own decision to Leave.If they regard this as betrayal, they show no signs of correcting it with a big majority for the Tories (or anyone else) any time soon. Their voting behaviour exposes a tentativeness about change that showed up as long ago as the 2010 general election, when the Tories’ tough fiscal plan spooked a nation that had seemed theirs for the taking.In short, the post-crash British are indeed ravenous for change – until they are forced to define it. As much as they want “something different”, they are not sold on any one version of it. The question is whether distaste for the options on offer eventually becomes grudging forbearance of the status quo.If weak government is the new default, it will not just moderate the terms of EU exit, but public policy beyond. On present form, no government will have the electoral numbers for either laissez-faire or a reassertion of the state in the private economy. Britain will have regained a substantial amount of sovereignty and chosen to do precious little with it. If so, the referendum may come to look less like proof of a coherent national revolt than an uncharacteristic gamble that voters almost immediately hedged against with their electoral choices.The elite’s failure to see Brexit coming has led to an over-correction. A view of the public has set in as nihilists bent on throwing the accumulated wisdoms of the past few decades up in the air and seeing where they land. But people, swing voters especially, still have jobs, mortgages and other tangibles to weigh against the abstract promise of change. Human risk-aversion was not enough to save Britain’s EU membership in 2016, but nor did it disappear. It is unclear what voters want these days, other than their rulers on the shortest of leashes. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":null,"title":"leopard snatches eats toddler ugandan national park","story":"Leopard in Uganda\u0026#39s Murchison Falls National Park, Uganda, AfricaUgandan authorities are hunting for a leopard in Queen Elizabeth National park  after it snatched and ate a ranger\u0027s three-year-old son. The toddler had been left in the care of a nanny at the unfenced staff quarters of a safari lodge in the park, when he was taken by the leopard on Friday night.Wildlife authority spokesman Bashir Hangi said the child had followed the nanny outdoors.The maid was not aware the child followed her. She heard the kid scream for help, she intervened but it was too late the leopard had vanished with it in the bush and a search was mounted until we got the skull the next day, he said.The hunt is on with the intention of capturing the leopard and removing it from the wild because once it has eaten human flesh, the temptations are high to eat another human being, it becomes dangerous, he added.The sun sets over Lake George near Uganda\u0026#39s Queen Elizabeth National Park in western Uganda,Queen Elizabeth is Uganda\u0027s most-visited national park, with tourists flocking to watch leopards roam the Mweya Peninsula, which lies beside Lake Edward.The park also hosts African buffalo, Nile crocodile, lions and chimpanzees. The attack comes just a week after a British safari park owner was attacked by a lion in South Africa.  Mike Hodge, 71, suffered a broken jaw after he was mauled in Marakele Animal Sanctuary in Thabazimbi.Mr Hodge had been showing visitors around the park when the big cat charged him and dragged him into some bushes.Video footage of the incident showed terrified tourists screaming for help as the lion mauled its victim.Keepers eventually killed the 10-year-old lion, named Samba, and Mr Hodge was taken to hospital.  Two years ago, in South Africa, a year a six-year-old boy was snatched by a leopard at Kruger National park, but the youngster escaped with his life. Kellan Denny was playing with his brother on a wall when the leopard sunk its teeth into his shoulder and dragged him away. However, the leopard let go of the traumatised boy, allowing his father to rush in and carry him to safety. The incident was the first of its kind in 40 years, according to a spokesman for Kruger National Park. Ramadan 2018: How Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranDonald Trump tells Emmanuel Macron he \u0026#39plans to withdraw\u0026#39 from Iran nuclear deal - live updatesComment: If the first time we hold a baby is when we have one ourselves, it\u0026#39s no wonder we mothers are in troubleNew outbreak of Ebola affects at least 2 in northwest DR Congo Comment: Our parliament should be the protector of free speech, not its suppressor Malaysian prime minister faces fight for his political life after heated election campaignScotland Yard suspends forensic scientist amid fears 21 rape cases could be compromised\u0026#39Acid\u0026#39 attack: Woman hosed down by fire brigade as police hunt man who \u0026#39targeted\u0026#39 herMoscow region protests against \u0026#39rubbish collapse\u0026#39 as Putin\u0026#39s friends look to profitSpider taught to jump on command in bid to create army of pest-fighting robotsWet wipes to be ‘eliminated’ in UK as conservationists say they are changing the shape of Thames riverbed Royal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?Hawaii resident returns home to find lava from Kilauea volcano spewing over fencePolice finish probing every Salisbury site linked to the Skripal poisoning apart from spy\u0026#39s houseBus bursts into flames in Rome on shopping street between Spanish Steps and Trevi FountainLondon theatre: the 26 best plays and shows on nowComment: Rudy Giuliani is not out of control.

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that.

Are you pregnant? How\u0026nbspmuch do you earn? In the first of a new series,\u0026nbspentitled You Can’t Ask Me That,\u0026nbspnovelist Christine Manby\u0026nbsplooks at the numerous questions that we just\u0026nbspcannot ask and seeks to explain the reasons whyPicture the scene. You’re at a party. You know no one but the host and they’ve had to rush to the kitchen to rescue some smoking vol-au-vents from the oven. You spot a friendly looking fellow guest, also on their own, and sidle over to make their acquaintance by the buffet table. You swap names. You compare notes on your respective journeys to the venue. You talk about the weather. Hasn’t it been strange this year? So far so good. Now what?The host passes by with those vol-au-vents. You grab one and shove it in your mouth. And before you’ve entirely finished eating it you come out with the line, “So, what do you do?”If this were the 1970s, the needle would skitter across the vinyl on the record player, bringing the music to an abrupt and ugly end. As it is, the entire room falls silent as everyone turns to stare.The etiquette guide to Whatsapp group chatsIt’s not that your mouth is still full of vol-au-vent crumbs. Though that is pretty disgusting. It’s because they’re thinking: “You just asked what?”You just asked somebody what they do? Quelle horreur. You thought you were making small talk but you’ve accidentally outed yourself as being a bit of a prat.           I had no idea you weren’t supposed to ask people “what they do” until I was about 35 and I read an article by one of those etiquette gurus who if he had any real manners, wouldn’t spend so much time pronouncing on other people’s. It shouldn’t have bothered me, but it did. I was sure I had asked that question on many occasions. I’d certainly answered it. Did people think I was an ill-mannered oaf? The etiquette expert did not, alas, go into the reasons for his pronouncement and I was left none the wiser.I have in the past told people I’m an unemployed stunt rider to circumvent awkward conversationsSo why don’t people like being asked what they do?Maybe it’s because the rest of the question, which generally remains unspoken, is “for a living”. “What do you do for a living?” Already sounds a bit worse, doesn’t it? A bit too personal? Once you know what someone does to get by, it can immediately change your perception of that person. Maybe you were starting to fancy them, but now you know they’re an actuary? Too dull. Or a social worker? Too poor. Or a stay-at-home mum? Oh no. You’ll have to talk about nappies all night.Before you know it, you lazily start to project the cliched characteristics of the occupation onto your new friend and in doing so fail to give yourself a chance to get to know them in any real way. They’ve already been labelled and put in the appropriate box.  Likewise, there’s always the danger that when you tell someone what you do for a living, they’ll have further questions you should actually be charging to answer.Doctors have all experienced the horror of being whisked away from the table at a dinner party to take a quick look at someone’s rash. Lawyers are asked to comment on orce cases at wedding receptions. Plumbers are suddenly handed toilet plungers instead of another glass of champagne.   Everything you need to know about dating app etiquetteNovelists have it worst of all. It’s my experience that upon hearing I’m a novelist (having already worked out that I’m not JK Rowling or EL James), nine out of 10 people want to tell me about the book they’re writing. Could I show it to my publisher? Or they’ll tell me about a story they have that’s just bound to be a bestseller only they don’t have time to write it themselves. Perhaps I could write it for them and they’ll give me 10 per cent of the proceeds? Does that sound reasonable? Only once in my 20-year career has a complete stranger ever told me a story that made me want to reach for my pen.I have in the past told people I’m an unemployed stunt rider to circumvent those awkward conversations, so I do understand why “what do you do” can be a loaded question.But let’s be realistic. It’s not easy to make small talk with a stranger. I would never cut someone dead or judge their social standing just because they’d resorted to the easy questions on a first encounter. Sometimes you really don’t know what else to say. Modern conversation is a veritable minefield. It used to be that you should never talk about religion or politics but the list of subjects that are verboten seems to grow by the day. We can’t all talk about the weather until the end of time. Though having said that, hasn’t the weather been strange?If the question bothers you that much, then I would go with ‘I’m a water slide tester’.When I said I was going to be writing about the questions we just can’t ask each other, because they’re considered impolite or because they’re actually illegal (such as “how old are you” in certain contexts), a friend of mine agreed with the etiquette expert that asking “what do you do” was the very height of bad manners. My friend would admit to having asked the question only once so far as he could remember, saying that he’d deployed it in desperation at a fancy dinner party. His neighbour at the table was monosyllabic. The conversation was going absolutely nowhere so my friend dropped the “wdyd” bomb thinking that at least if he found out his neighbour was an accountant, they could talk about taper relief.“I’m a drummer,” said the man.“In your spare time?”Apparently the conversation didn’t pick up after that.So, what can you ask instead? A better question is perhaps, “What do you do in your free time?” Whereas people often have to work at jobs they hate just to pay the mortgage, what they do in their free time should, by definition, be something they simply enjoy. Maybe the actuary you’ve already dismissed as boring is passionate about the Argentine tango, imbuing every step with the spirit of the brave and unruly gaucho. They might have danced you into bed. So ask what someone loves to do before you ask them what they have to do. Whether the answer is “needlework, specifically cross-stitch” or “attending furring conventions in the New Forest dressed a hamster”, there’s got to be at least 10 minutes more conversation to be had.Eleven etiquette rules to remember next time you flyMan who studied rich people found 3 etiquette aspects they never shirkEtiquette coach prompts outrage by claiming Christmas tinsel is commonIf you say these 28 words, you\u0027re poshA pool etiquette guide for mothers braving a family holidayMeanwhile, the perfect response to “what do you do” has to be “what do I do about what?” If you’re feeling mean, that is. If the question bothers you that much, then I would go with “I’m a water slide tester”. It’s an actual job. You have to rate theme park water slides for exhilaration and splash factor. You just need to be able to swim. Imagine what’ll go through your new friends’ minds when they hear that’s what you get up to all day. Interestingly, despite the etiquette snob’s assertion that enquiring after someone’s occupation marks you out as not being from “the top drawer” as it were, I’ve heard that when they’re meeting people in those interminable line-ups, the Royals always ask “and what do you do?”I wonder if anyone has ever asked the same question in return?*Of course he wasn’t in U2.

Ben Widdicombe visited the Marvel Comics creator at his home and heard him declare: ‘Nobody has more freedom’Stan Lee, the Marvel Comics maestro and co-creator of Spider-Man, X-Men and Black Panther, lives in a world of heroes and villains. But these days, it can be hard to tell which is which.Few creators have left as profound a mark on popular culture. According to The-Numbers, a box office data site, films featuring Lee’s superheroes have grossed more than $24bn (£17.2bn) worldwide. He has a huge Twitter following, and admirers have included Federico Fellini, Ronald Reagan and George RR Martin, the author of Game of Thrones.“Stan is right up there with Walt Disney as one of the great creators of not just one character, but a whole galaxy of characters that have become part of our lives,” Martin said. “Right now, I think he’s probably bigger than Disney.”Stan Lee\u0027s Avengers: Infinity War cameo might be his funniest yetYet at the summit of Lee’s career, storm clouds have gathered.The last year has brought an unsettling mix of tragedy and scandal, including the death in July of Joan Lee, his wife of almost 70 years suspicions that millions of dollars have been siphoned from his accounts even gossip reports that a former business associate stole his blood to sell to fans.Lee with his late wife Joan in 2011. Since she died last year the household has been thrown into disarray (Getty)Earlier this month, The Hollywood Reporter published an investigation that said Lee, 95, is the victim of “elder abuse”, partly at the hands of his 67-year-old daughter, Joan Celia Lee. The Daily Beast reported in March that Lee, who is said to be worth around $50m, was “surrounded by a panoply of Hollywood charlatans and mountebanks” and being “picked apart by vultures”.A radio talk show in Orlando, Florida, even aired a rumour that he is being “held captive” by handlers who “have him basically locked up in the house”.But on a recent visit to Lee’s home in the Bird Streets, a celebrity enclave high in the hills of West Hollywood, California, the man himself said otherwise.True, a 6ft 4in security guard, with a pistol on his hip, opened the front gate. And Lee hasn’t been getting out as much since a bout of pneumonia left him short of breath and looking frail. He also can no longer read because of macular degeneration.Lee pictured in New York in 1978: ‘Lately, I have found out that a lot of the money we made is no longer available for me’ (Getty)Despite all that, Lee seemed relaxed and enthusiastic. Wearing a yellow shirt and beige polyester slacks in his poolside sitting room, its Sherwood-green carpet bleached by 40 years of California sunshine, he welcomed a reporter into his home.So, is he a prisoner in his own house, surrounded by real-life supervillains?“I’m the luckiest guy in the world,” Lee said, chuckling and sounding like a 95-year-old teenager. “Nobody has more freedom.”He also defended his daughter, known as JC, against claims that she has been physically abusive and a financial drain. “My daughter has been a great help to me,” he said. “Life is pretty good.”A house in disarrayFor four decades, Lee has lived in a relatively modest two-storey house in the middle of what has become some of Los Angeles’ most valuable real estate. DrDre is a neighbour, and Leonardo DiCaprio lives down the block, on a street where houses can list for north of $30m.Inside the suburban-style home, a nurse and a maid bustled in the kitchen. Although Lee seemed at ease, the armed guard lent an air of surveillance that made it difficult to entirely relax.The house is a time capsule of late 1970s Hollywood. Decorated by his late wife, it is dotted with ceramic animals, carved figures in African and Asian styles, and large gilt-framed mirrors hung on mirrored walls. Empty hooks surrounded by dusty outlines sit amid prints and original works by noted artists – Joan Miro, Pablo Picasso, Alexander Calder, Salvador Dali and Roy Lichtenstein – suggesting a home being slowly eroded.“My wife, she’s the only person in the world that I would know of who would put a big mirror on top of a big mirror,” Lee said. “And when she was here, she had so many paintings, all over. Most of them have left now. My daughter took a lot of them, and a lot of them have gone elsewhere.”It’s the vagueness about what has “gone elsewhere” that has some of Lee’s friends so worried.Since Lee’s wife died last year, his household has been thrown into disarray, with three factions of once-trusted aides vying for control. Lee’s current gatekeeper is Keya Morgan, who has ousted former staff.Producer Keya Morgan and Joan C Lee – are they real-life supervillains holding Lee hostage? (Getty)A former memorabilia dealer from New York, Morgan moved to Los Angeles as the executive producer of the mobster biopic Gotti and now describes himself as a “producing partner of John Travolta”. Sitting at Lee’s side, he was dressed in a black suit and tie, black bowler hat and dark sunglasses, which he lowered on his nose to see indoors.In February, Morgan called police to the house to physically remove Lee’s longtime road manager, Mac Anderson, known as Max. Anderson was accused of, among other things, attempting to bribe a nurse to make statements that Lee was being held hostage. “He got into a big fight with Stan and Stan’s daughter” and was fired soon afterward, Morgan said.Reached by phone, Anderson declined to comment.Also out was Jerry Olivarez, a Hollywood publicist who briefly obtained power of attorney over Lee’s affairs last year, during which time more than $1m left the Marvel creator’s accounts. That included a $300,000 cheque made out to Hands of Respect, a novelty company owned by Olivarez and Lee that makes a $10 lapel pin advocating racial harmony.In unrelated matters, $1.4m may have vanished in a series of wire transfers, and a Chanel handbag full of cash may be missing from the house, according to Morgan. Also, a trove of Marvel memorabilia, including character sketches and figurines, is the subject of disputed ownership between Anderson and Lee, as reported by The Hollywood Reporter.Lee may be a creative genius, but he isn’t a financial one. “I’ve been very careless with money,” he said.“I had a partner or two who – since I’m not a money counter – I let them take care of keeping track of the money we made,” Lee said, as he sipped a bottle of mineral water to soothe his raspy voice. “Lately, I have found out that a lot of the money we made is no longer available for me. I don’t know where it is, but a guy, and maybe one or two others, have found a way to take it.“So, I feel bad about it, and of course we have a lawyer trying to get it back again,” he said. “But money isn’t worth losing your cool about, you know.”The child of Romanian Jewish immigrants, Stanley Lieber was born in New York City in 1922. He was hired in 1939 as an assistant at Timely Comics, the not-especially-promising ision of a pulp magazine publisher that would eventually be renamed Marvel.Following a staff exodus the next year, the newly rechristened Lee (an alias he adopted to save his real name for the great novels he aspired to write) was appointed its editor. The two great motifs of his life were established: a nagging feeling that his work in comics was cultural schlock and the fact that he would be a lifelong corporate employee, never owning the rights to his creations.His greatest streak of inspiration began in 1961, when Lee was almost 40 and thoroughly disenchanted with his career. With artist Jack Kirby, he created the Fantastic Four, a hit he bested the next year by inventing Spider-Man with artist Steve Ditko.Among the enduring characters he created over the next decade with those artists, and others, are the X-Men, Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, Doctor Strange and, in 1966, Black Panther: an African warrior-king whose recent film adventure has grossed more than $1.3bn.“I’m sorry I didn’t introduce black characters a little sooner,” Lee said. “I tried to create an Asian superhero, I tried to create a South American superhero. And at that point I also was thinking it’s ridiculous that we don’t have a black superhero.”Asked if contemporary comics and films could be doing a better job of representing women and superheroes of colour, he replied, “yes”, but expanded: “You can’t force anything on the public. But if you do a black hero or heroine and you see that it’s well-received at the newsstand, then you’d be an idiot not to come up with more stories like that.

While he has made exponentially more money than any of his Marvel co-creators, he only ever collected a salary, and does not receive any continuing royalties from the films based on his characters.In 2005, he received a one-time payment of $10m from Marvel, to settle a provision in his contract that had entitled him to 10 per cent of the profits from television and film adaptations. Four years later, Disney bought Marvel for $4bn it is unclear whether Lee was able to reap any benefit. (As Marvel’s chairman emeritus, he still receives a salary, reported to be $1m.)And while his personal appearances (including charging fans $120 for an autograph) are a lucrative source of income, later-life attempts to create wholly owned superhero properties have foundered.Stan Lee Media, a digital content startup, crashed in 2000 and landed his business partner, Peter F Paul, in prison for securities fraud. And Lee is embroiled in disputes with POW! Entertainment, the company he started in 2001 to create new shows, including Stripperella, a cartoon animation starring Pamela Anderson.POW! was sold last year to Camsing International, a Hong Kong-based company seeking to clone Marvel for the Asian market. Lee says he has not been paid, which the company denies. “Mr Lee has been paid and continues to be paid by the company,” said Shane Duffy, the chief executive of POW! “Statements like this only heighten our concern for Stan’s wellbeing.”Lee and actor Chadwick Boseman at the LA world premiere of ‘Black Panther’ in January (Getty)As part of the escalating fight, Morgan and Lee’s daughter entered the POW! offices on Santa Monica Boulevard on the night of 14 March and removed items they say belong to Lee. They triggered a silent alarm, prompting POW! to file a police report.The Beverly Hills police subsequently dropped the burglary investigation, but the fighting continues. “They’re acting as if they bought the company and everything on the four walls belong to them,” said Lee, sounding downcast. “So, another lawsuit.”An Oscar for Stan Lee?Outside the bubble of legal drama and personal strife, however, Lee’s creative influence remains at an all-time high.“There’s no doubt that Stan, in terms of American popular culture, he’s one of the giants of the 20th century,” Martin said. “Spider-Man and Iron Man the X-Men – they’re still as viable as ever.”From the floral sofa in his sitting room, Lee is a font of highly entertaining stories from the glory days, even if some of them sound taller than his 1962 creation Giant-Man.Like the time Picasso was so taken by Joan Lee’s beauty that he approached the couple in a New York restaurant and sketched her on their tablecloth. “We ran home to tell my father about what happened,” Lee said. But, “in our excitement, we had left the drawing in the restaurant. We never found it!”Stan Lee turns 94: His 25 best cameos in Marvel filmsStan Lee has already filmed cameos for four more Marvel moviesStan Lee has only good things to say about Tom Holland\u0027s Spider-ManOr the time when DiCaprio told Lee that he had written to the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, lobbying for Lee to receive an honorary Oscar for his numerous cameos over the years. (Lee appears in nearly every Marvel movie, including Black Panther, in which he plays a gambler in a South Korean casino.)DiCaprio also wants to portray Lee in a film about the Marvel creator, according to Morgan, who accompanied Lee on a recent visit to DiCaprio’s house. (A spokesman for DiCaprio would not confirm this account of their conversation.)The thought of a biopic starring DiCaprio gave Lee pause. He looked out over the pool, to the canyon beyond, and pondered being portrayed by an Oscar-winning actor.“I don’t know if he could capture the essence of me,” he said, after a moment. “We have to talk about that.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The cost of paying privately for dialysis sessions in the EU is up to €1,000 (£880) a week depending on the circumstances and procedures used.”Jeremy Hunt supported Remain during the referendum (Getty)Charities echoed the MEPs’ comments, warning that long-term conditions would continue to “cross borders” whatever the political status of the UK.Fiona Loud, policy director at the charity Kidney Care UK, told The Independent: “Every day we hear from people who are anxious about the very real possibility that their freedom to travel could be curtailed due to changes in reciprocal healthcare rights. Whatever happens as we leave the EU, the needs of people with long-term conditions will continue to cross borders.“For the 29,000 people in the UK who have kidney failure and who need dialysis to stay alive, the EHIC system is essential to allow them to travel in Europe. Everyone has the right to live their lives to the full, including people on dialysis so we need a clear commitment from the government to protect kidney patients post-Brexit. “Whatever happens as we leave the EU, the needs of people with long-term conditions will continue to cross borders.”In the early stages of withdrawal talks, the EU guaranteed that anyone abroad at the point of Brexit would be able to retain their EHIC card. But there has been no reported movement on the status of the card for other travellers, making up the vast majority of the population.Catherine Bearder, a Liberal Democrat MEP and one of the letter’s signatories, added: “Far from providing a boost to the NHS – Brexit means all patients lose their free healthcare rights when travelling abroad in the EU.“It’s time Jeremy Hunt stood up for the NHS and the vulnerable in these negotiations.“Whatever the Brexit deal looks like, the British people should have the final say on whether they think it is as good as the deal we have now inside the EU.”Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The lowest regional support is in the ConnaughtUlster statistical region, at 89 per cent – still an overwhelming figure.  Maybe the Irish should leave the EU87 per cent of those polled believed Ireland had on balance benefited from EU membership, with just 10 per cent disagreeing. Unemployed people were less likely to agree, however, at 70 per cent.Smaller majorities of people supported Ireland contributing more to the EU budget and joining in a future EU defence and security union.Noelle O’Connell, executive director of European Movement Ireland, which commissioned the poll, said: “People are very clear that leaving the EU would not be in Ireland’s interests. However, there is understandable uncertainty about what changes Brexit will bring to Ireland, the border and the Ireland-UK trade relationship in the long term.“Contrary to recent claims, at 92 per cent support for Ireland’s membership of the EU remains strong in fact it is at an all-time high since we first undertook this poll in 2013.”In August 2017 Nigel Farage urged Ireland to leave the EU. “Maybe the best thing for Ireland given that she’s stuck in the wrong currency, given that nearly all of her overseas business is denominated in dollars or sterling, maybe the Irish should leave the EU and then we could then work out our own terms between us,” he said. Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

The arrests were often violent, and sometimes with the support of unofficial vigilante forces. Police released Mr Navalny later that evening, but many of his supporters remained in custody throughout the inauguration. Today’s ceremony mainly followed the protocol of previous years, but there were departures. The major innovation was the debut of Mr Putin’s new 12.5bn ruble limousine, the “Kortezh”. But the car would not sweep through central Moscow as six years ago. The image of a depopulated city centre on lockdown that day left an awkward aftertaste, and today there would be no repeat.Instead, Mr Putin’s new limousine made the short trip from his Kremlin offices to the ceremonial halls. Key Putin opponent among hundreds arrested in violent Moscow clashesTrump targets Russian oligarchs and Putin allies in fresh US sanctionsDonald Trump suggested meeting Vladimir Putin at the White HouseTrump ‘tells Vladimir Putin: “If there is an arms race, ‘I’ll win’”Inside, dignitaries included some of Mr Putin’s closest friends, like the former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and American actor Steven Seagal. There were the stars of Russia’s beau monde – from film director Nikita Mikhalkov to rapper Timati. And there was a mix of the stranger symbols of Mr Putin’s rule: biker Alexander Zaldostanov, aka “the surgeon” the uber-loyal head of the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill and the tsar-worshipping, ultra-conservative Natalia Poklonskaya. Pro-Kremlin youth and the heads of the regional electoral commission were also on the guest list. These groups were the sergeants of March’s presidential elections, considered a great success. That vote returned Mr Putin with a 77 per cent share, and proved to be a disaster for the liberal opposition. Looking relaxed, contented, and not without swagger, Mr Putin delivered a short address. The message was simple enough. The president repeated the promises of a decisive technological breakthrough he first made during his state-of-the-nation speech in March. But he was notably less belligerent this time. Nuclear weapons had given way to motherhood, youth and raising living standards. “Russia has been through troubles before,” he said. “And we always rise above them, like a Phoenix.” Later in the day, the president confirmed that, as expected, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev would retain his role as head of the government. According to some sources, Mr Putin was also likely to appoint the liberal reformer Alexei Kudrin to a top economic post. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesRussian President Vladimir Putin walks before his President inauguration ceremony at the Kremlin in Moscow.Lava from a robust fissure eruption on Kilauea\u0027s east rift zone consumes a home, then threatens another, near Pahoa, Hawaii.

These will mostly be paid for by increased taxes, given the limited appetite for serious reform.“No one is debating whether to reject crony capitalism, state control of business and the economy, or the confrontation with the West,” said Valery Solovey, professor of the Moscow State Institute for International Relations. “Of course, this is why there will be no real breakthrough”.According to a poll published on Monday by the independent Levada Centre, Russians say welfare and inequality remain the government’s biggest failure to date. The Kremlin fares better when it comes to foreign policy, with half mentioning the return of great power status as Mr Putin’s major achievement. The combination of both factors means political liberalisation is unlikely to be around the corner, Mr Solovey said.“It is too early to make strategic conclusions,” said Mr Solovey. “But if confrontation with the West and social tensions continue on their current trajectory, domestic policy is only going to get tougher.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It was their second time in Israel, and the visiting couple were served a top-notch meal by celebrity Israeli chef Segev Moshe.Japan\u0027s Abe makes controversial offering at \u0027shrine to militarism\u0027Netanyahu\u0027s performance shows why Iran nuclear deal needs to remainBut then came dessert.

There is nothing lowlier than a shoe in Japanese culture. Not only do they not wear shoes at home, you also won\u0027t find shoes in their offices. This is disrespect of the first order.Chocolate selection from the world 🌎 by #SegevArt ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  A metal shoe by @tomdixonstudioA post shared by  segevmoshe (@segevmoshe) on May 6, 2018 at 10:57pm PDTA Japanese diplomat, also not named by the paper, said: There\u0027s no culture in the world in which you put shoes on the table. What was the distinguished chef thinking? If it was humour, we don\u0027t think it is funny we were offended on behalf of our prime minister.Israel\u0027s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was not involved in approving the dishes for the meal.We respect and appreciate the chef. He is very creative, the ministry said.Trump and Shinzo Abe fail to agree on US tariff exemption for JapanMr Segev\u0027s creative side was displayed last May when President Trump visited Israel. Then, the celebrity chef served up a dessert in the shape of a double-headed Trump and Netanyahu.On Sunday, Mr Segev proudly posted a close-up photo of the offending shoe-filled dessert on his Instagram account, writing: Chocolate selection from the world by #SegevArt - - - A metal shoe by @tomdixonstudioThe dessert was served inside a sculpture by international artist Tom Dixon, whose works are displayed in major museums around the world and for the first time was displayed in Israel at a meal. This is a high-quality piece of art made of cast metal in the shape of a shoe it is not a real shoe, Segev\u0027s publicist said in a statement, according to Yediot Aharonot.On Instagram, however, some of his 72,000 followers offered a different opinion:When you cook at a diplomatic meal, the minimum you can do is enquire about the guest. In Japan, shoes are considered contemptible, they always take off their shoes at the entrance to every home, both for themselves and for others, wrote one person.Another person wrote: you don\u0027t need to know any culture to know that serving shoes at a dinner is WRONG!World news in picturesWorld news in picturesRussian President Vladimir Putin walks before his President inauguration ceremony at the Kremlin in Moscow.Lava from a robust fissure eruption on Kilauea\u0027s east rift zone consumes a home, then threatens another, near Pahoa, Hawaii.

They also highlighted that the two leaders did not hold a news conference.Prime minister perhaps it\u0027s time to stop with the fake news!!!

But the more things change, the more they stay the same\u0026nbspLebanon is a colourful place at the moment. Spring has been unusually warm the hillsides above Beirut are green and the pink and purple blossom of bougainvillea and jacaranda trees drift down onto the city’s streets.  The plethora of new political flags and posters, however, is definitely more eye-catching.  On Sunday Lebanon’s erse population of six million will cast their votes for the first time since 2009 in a national election which should end almost a decade of political gridlock.Lebanon Prime Minister Saad Hariri says resignation on hold awaiting talksThe new elections come with a set of complicated new rules designed to move Lebanon towards a proportionally representative system for the first time, allowing space for more independents and reducing the power of establishment blocs formed by the country’s multiconfessional political system.Critics, however, say that since the new electoral law asks voters to pick lists of allied sects and parties, as well as prioritise inidual candidates on the list of their choice, it accentuates the already isive tendencies of Lebanon’s complex politics by making candidates on the same slates compete with each other. “Like almost every law on the books in Lebanon, the way it looks on paper is very different to how it is applied or fairly administered in practice,” said Imad Salameh, a professor of politics at Beirut’s Lebanese American University. “We are injecting into the normal proportional system this Lebanese twist. Parliament is unlikely to change too much. But it is a step in the right direction.”Lebanon’s politics – which involves 18 officially represented sectarian groups – is famously complicated. The filth and the fury: A mountain of rubbish is blighting Lebanon\u0027s once-beautiful beachesThe filth and the fury: A mountain of rubbish is blighting Lebanon\u0027s once-beautiful beachesIn the Christian villages just below the cedar forests of north Lebanon’s Tannourine, huge posters of the Christian president, Michel Aoun, are currently hung underneath tens of Shia Hezbollah’s distinctive yellow flag, green fists brandishing AK-47s.  Some of the country’s more surprising political partnerships – such as that of the recently elected Mr Aoun and Lebanon’s Sunni prime minister, Saad Hariri – say a lot about how Lebanon’s internal politics are still intrinsically linked to its position in the region and the Middle East’s wider power struggles. Lebanese media has been dominated in recent weeks by pundits angry that the country’s biggest issues – the heavily indebted economy, the disarmament of Hezbollah, Syrian refugees and crises in public services such as electricity and garbage – have for the most part been sidelined by the major parties, who are too preoccupied with forging allegiances to maintain the status quo to assure voters they will do what’s best for the country.Analysts believe that the reaction of Iran and the administration of US President Donald Trump – both of which have proxy interests in Lebanon – will depend on other events across the region.“The problem is, the Trump administration and Iran will treat the election results depending on so many other factors,” said Mohaned Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Centre. US pledges support for Lebanon’s army after Israeli ‘Hezbollah’ claimPiles of rubbish wash up on Beirut beach amid national waste crisisThe Boustani house encompasses both the tragedy and faith of LebanonSaudi Arabia has threatened Lebanese stability in the past“There’s so much happening in May in the region alone. We will still be counting the votes, probably, when Trump pulls out of the Iran deal, and Iraq holds its own elections, which may change a lot in the Shia power balance there. “Our future is dependent on many variables outside our control.”The rest of the Middle East casts a long shadow on the tiny country. Internally, so do ongoing rows over gerrymandering, conflicts of interest, party funding and the steep cost for independents for running a slate.Despite all that, however, there is still a sense of optimism among many young people in Lebanon – 800,000 of whom are excited to cast a vote for the first time. Art exhibition in Lebanon shut down by people trying to erase imperialism from their historyA record number of women are running this year and civil society movements aimed at educating people about their democratic rights are flourishing. “The best way of looking at these elections is: they are an exercise for the new blood in Lebanese politics and new candidates and movements popping up everywhere to try contest the sectarian establishment and elite,” said Mr Ali. “It is building up some sort of new independent movement for the next round. It’s a long process, and there’s a long way to go.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Woolly mammoths return from dead: Furry mammals could be CLONED                Fingerprint breakthrough could help stop ivory tradeUsing seismological techniques designed for studying earthquakes, researchers have been able to classify the animals\u0026rsquo various behaviours through monitoring the tremors their movements send through the ground.Lead scientists, Dr Beth Mortimer of the Universities of Oxford and Bristol, and Professor Tarje Nissen-Meyer, along with Masters student Mr William Rees and Dr Paula Koelemeijer, used small sensors called \u0026lsquogeo-phones\u0026rsquo to measure the ground-based vibrations generated by elephants in Kenya\u0026rsquos Samburu National Reserve.The researchers were able to detect low frequency seismic vibrations produced by vocalisations known as \u0026ldquorumbles which could be compared to airborne and ground-based sounds.With the aid of computer models, the researchers say the vibrations go beyond what is audible and suggest elephant can use ground transmitted information to know the whereabouts of the rest of the herd over several miles, depending on terrain.Dr Mortimer said: \u0026ldquoVibration detection is a forgotten sense in the study of many animals, but is particularly important for elephants.The findings, published in the journal Current Biology, offer a new way to detect elephants and discern their behaviour without having them in sight, with the potential of proving real-time information on elephant distress and poaching threats in remote locations.As part of the research, the team also conducted experiments wielding a sledge hammer on the ground to measure the vibrations produced by cars, people hopping and aircraft flying overhead to understand the variety of human noises that might be picked up while recording elephants.Conservationists are increasingly worried about the effects of human noise pollution.NCScientists hope to build on these findings to better understand elephantsSave the Elephants chief executive Frank Pope said: \u0026ldquoLegends and folklore have long spoken about the way elephants can not only communicate across long distances, but also detect other events that shake the ground like far-off thunder.\u0026ldquoThis study marks a new phase in trying to understand the nature of the vibrations elephants produce and how they might be used by elephants themselves.\u0026ldquoAlong the way it is opening our eyes to the challenges posed by human-generated noise in an increasingly crowded landscape.For fellow researcher Professor Nissen-Meyer the research is a foundation for understanding elephants in their precious haunts.She explained: \u0026ldquoWe hope to build on these initial findings to develop a comprehensive approach for monitoring and understanding the behaviour of large mammals in these pristine, changing and fragile environments, and examine whether elephants can localise not only their peers or other species, but also environmental factors such as water."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/590x/meghan-markle-royal-wedding-956732.jpg","title":"Meghan Markle prince harry royal wedding windsor weddings","story":"                Tenerife volcano alert: Shock as 270 earthquakes hit Brit holiday f...

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Never slurp loudly or gulp“It’s absolutely wonderful we have people visiting us from all over the world.“It was similar with Charles and Diana and William and Kate but for Americans this wedding is even more special because we have Meghan - an American woman marrying into the royal family.”While Edmund’s wife Mary is preparing to travel to Windsor Castle for the wedding, Edmund will stay behind and host a royal wedding party where guests are encouraged to wear bridal gowns and bridesmaid dresses.“This wedding is not going to be quite like any other royal wedding …we have this beautiful lady from America who has come from just a normal regular life, nothing to do with royalty.“And she comes and managed to meet Prince Harry who has had an interesting life and fallen in love and I think its a wonderful match.“I think actually Meghan is going to revolutionize the royal family in a way.“I think shes the future of the royal family, to be honest. She brings up brand new feel and look to the royal of the family and she get on with Will and Kate. They call them the fab four and I think they are the wonderful four.“I theyll be able to do a tremendous amount for Great Britain and the Commonwealth because of Megans experience helping people, with children, helping those less fortunate people.“Shes been to London.

No, these are the views of Labour’s Big Beasts on the Marxist puppet who stole their party.Brighty - The SunThursday’s local elections suggest Brexit will be the battlefield for the next election, with Labour alienating millions who voted Leave.Alastair Campbell and David Blunkett led the attack on Jeremy Corbyn, blaming him for allowing Jew-baiting anarchists and union paymaster Len McCluskey to kill Labour’s dream of power.“If we cannot beat this shambles of a Tory party, we don’t deserve to be in the game,” warned Tony Blair’s old spin doctor.Campbell, a ferocious Remainer, tore into Corbyn for missing open goals over Brexit, Windrush deportees, the Grenfell inferno and the never- ending NHS ­crisis.But he is especially appalled by Labour’s “Militant-style nastiness . . . anti-Semitism . . . and the feeling that some in the leader- ship feel greater animus against Labour supporters than the Tories.”Blunkett’s attack is even more personal. “Jeremy’s ­leadership is going nowhere,” he warns.The ex-Home Secretary blamed Corbyn directly for the wave of anti-Semitism that cost Labour dearly in London and the reign of terror against anyone who dared to speak out.“He could have cauterised the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader,” fumed Blunkett. “He has fudged and prevaricated.“I’ve seen the personal vitriol activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from Len McCluskey.“I’ve seen good Labour MPs traduced and insulted.”Such vicious public attacks from Blairite heroes make nonsense of pundits’ claims that nothing has changed since last week. Labour is in meltdown.Tories bracing themselves for humiliation on Thursday night were let off the hook. Labour’s retreat across swathes of ­Britain prove JC will never be PM. Labour should be 20 points ahead, not level-pegging.They are lumbered with their useless leader. The legion of “Oh Jeremy Corbyn” fans adore him. And who would take over if he stepped aside?Not John McDonnell, for sure.This new blame game exposes the quiet but corrosive civil war tearing Labour apart since Jezza seized the crown.Last year, moderates had been secretly plotting a leadership coup on the assumption Labour would lose the General Election.That was before JC emerged startled but triumphant from Theresa May’s “strong and stable” fiasco.Now the knives are out. And Brexit is splitting Labour as much as it is the Tories.Ex-Europe minister Caroline Flint ripped into Corbyn for siding with Brexit wreckers and using the issue to bash the Tories. Intriguingly, she believes Britain would have voted OUT whenever the referendum was staged in the last ten years — even if Labour had been in power.Now she believes Remainers should accept the voters’ ­verdict and help deliver the best Brexit deal possible.The Doncaster MP aimed her remarks at Corbyn but she might as easily have been talking about Alastair Campbell, who is campaigning for a ­second referendum.“Two-thirds of Labour MPs represent Leave-voting areas,” says Ms Flint. “We are alienating many traditional Labour voters.”Even Corbyn’s own supporters want him to ditch his opportunistic sabotage tactics.Steve Howell, who helped run his 2017 election bid, ­predicted a voter backlash with Labour shut out of power for a decade.“Labour is seen as too Remain,” he said. “We ignore this at our peril. We would hand Leave-voting areas over to the Tories and be destroyed at the next General Election.”Thursday’s elections prove voters of all parties are sick of Westminster shenanigans and will punish the party they blame most for a bad Brexit.Right now, that looks like Labour.“I feel pity for the women and contempt for the men,” she writes. “The man walking in pride, showing us his caught prey.“The law of this country, the law of all countries, should change. Covering a face is literally killing an identity. I would love to see men covered with burkas, for a few hours, when it’s hot.“Let’s ask them, ‘How are you feeling?

They used to pre-authorise your card for £1 but now it is £99.“So that is money taken from your account that you can’t use until they release it back once the other payment has cleared.“My complaint to them was that they should have notices on the petrol pumps making customers aware of this as they have changed their policy, 5th of may we got fuel and were still waiting for our refund. Absolute joke.”An Asda spokesman said the fee was issued by Visa and Mastercard and is part of a trial at several stores.A Mastercard spokesman: Last year a change in industry rules meant that petrol stations with automated fuel pumps were required to pre-authorise a value equivalent to a full tank of fuel, so that customers didn’t fill up with more fuel than they could afford.This is designed to protect them, and the petrol station.If customers don’t have the required funds in their bank account, a further step is available to petrol stations which allows them to check what available funds a customer has, enabling a lower value of fuel to be dispensed.While some customers may see a request for a higher amount than the fuel they bought - perhaps on their mobile banking app - these funds are not taken from their account. Only the value of the petrol dispensed is withdrawn.A Visa spokesman said: “The way that pay-at-pump fuel payments are treated has been standardised across the industry to ensure security for individual cardholders, retailers and card issuers.“When an individual chooses to pay at a pay-at-pump fuel dispenser, an initial amount is held against their account while they dispense their fuel to ensure that they have sufficient funds to pay for the cost of their fuel.

The answer is that there is a greater connection between the nose and the parts of the brain coding for emotion and memory than for the other senses.By combining an understanding of people’s favourite scents and the sensory benefits of the being near coastal environments, we have been able to create four fragrances that can potentially evoke positive memories and by so doing promote the production of the happy hormone serotonin.*Haven will be releasing a limited number of the fragrances to consumers via Havens blog, By the Beach, and will be reviewing retail distribution in early 2019.Bringing a dose of Vitamin sea into UK homes from four different corners of the UK coastline, the range includes:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This was the first international flight since assuming power because usually Kim moves about in an armoured train. Unsurprisingly he flew in plane operated by Air Koryo which has been dubbed as the “worst airline in the history of the world”.Two of the carrier’s Soviet Union built jets were spotted. One was an ancient four engine Ilyushin Il-76MD.The other was the SIlyushin IL-62 - the world’s largest airliner when it first went into production in 1963 - and only a handful remain because of its vintage.Kim has been pictured aboard one before and this was probably the plane he flew in. But while his plane is fitted out with all the mod-cons, passengers aboard other Air Koryo planes have to put up with horrid food, torturous propaganda and creaking planes.For ages Air Koryo attracted just one star on the global Skytrax ratings.This year it hasnt even been rated.Many of its ropy planes are banned from the EU amid safety concerns.Few foreigners have flown with Kims airline. One of them was photographer Arthur Mebius. He recently released a book called Dear Sky - The Planes and People of North Koreas Airline.His fascinating pictures reveal retro interiors and old-school airline hostess and pilot uniforms.Some planes reportedly suffer from problems with the cooling system with condensation dripping down on passengers.All passengers are served the fabled Koryo burger - an unidentifiable slice of processed meat nestling between a stale bun.The burger is always served stone cold and on a paper doily.It also includes a slice of rubbery-looking cheese, a few wispy slices of shredded cabbage or a single lettuce leaf.Some say the mystery sauce is red, some say it’s brown.But most generally agree it’s too watery to be blood left over from the unknown animal that became the patty.In-flight entertainment usually consists of patriotic songs to the leader but since the planes are so loud you will struggle to hear them anyway. Inside each cockpit is a picture of the man himself.  The airline makes very infrequent international journeys, although the airlines website claims flights do serve 23 destinations from Pyongyang, including Beijing, Shanghai and Dalian in China, Kuala Lumpur and Kuwait City.During his visit to the South Korea last month, Kim confessed he was “embarrassed” about his crumbling nations services and “honestly worried” about the south’s leader coming to visit.According Al Jazeera, Kim said: “I’d be honestly worried if you come, it might be embarrassing, the transportation is not good.”The dictator then referred to the South Korean KTX bullet train and said they didn’t have anything like that in North Korea."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000400889922.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"american airlines emergency landing chicago smoke","story":"According to a passenger, the smoke was coming from the planes cockpit.Travellers on flight AA 2587 reported seeing white mist shortly after taking off from Chicago OHare airport.Bruce Clark tweeted: Texts from my dad enroute to Tokyo on @AmericanAir via ORD to Dallas — smoke in cockpit, making emergency landing.A spokesperson for the company responded on Twitter: Were returning safely back to ORD, and we plan on changing out the plane.

The one-use wipes are among a string of items set for the chop in the government’s crackdown on waste. Cotton buds and plastic straws are already expected to be banned, and every supermarket chain in Britain has pledged to wipe out unnecessary plastics by 2025. It comes after reports that more than 5,000 wipes had collected in a 116 square metre area of the River Thames, near Hammersmith Bridge. It’s the highest number ever found in a single place and changed the shape of the river bed, with mounds visible above the water at low tides.  Some wet wipes are made with polypropylene - meaning they won\u0027t break down in the sewers and instead either clog our drains or wash up on our beaches. But even wipes which are labelled \u0027flushable\u0027 often contain plastic, meaning they will not biodegrade. The Marine Conservation Society says that the number of wet wipes found on UK beaches has increased by almost 700% over the last decade. A spokesperson for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “As part of our 25-year environment plan we have pledged to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste, and that includes single-use products that include plastic such as wet wipes.”  When one Mumsnet user spoke out last year calling for a ban on baby wipes, the idea was met with a frosty response, the Derby  reports.

Inheritance tax should be scrapped and replaced a new lifetime limit on inheritance and gifts of \u0026pound125,000 - with taxes kicking in on everything above that. The money raised would fund a \u0026pound10,000 payment for 25-year-olds to spend on property, tuition, to set up a business or to invest in pensions. It’s a suggestion from the Resolution Foundation’s Intergenerational Commission, who have dubbed it the “citizen’s inheritance”. Among the other recommendations in the commission’s report, released today, is a plan to make pensioners who work continue to pay National Insurance, to fund a \u0026pound2.3 billion windfall for the NHS. Straining social care services should receive the same amount but funded through a property tax, according to the group of peers, business leaders and policy experts.  Executive chairman Lord Willetts, a Conservative former minister, admitted the recommendations in the report were not easy or comfortable but said many no longer believe Britain\u0027s young and old are being treated fairly. He said: Britain\u0027s contract between generations lies at the heart of society. As families we provide for our children and parents at different times. We expect the state to support these natural instincts - but too often it is tilted in the opposite direction. Many people no longer believe that Britain is delivering on its obligations to young and old. But our commission shows how Britain can rise to this challenge. From an NHS levy to put healthcare on a firmer financial footing, to building more homes and a Citizen\u0027s Inheritance to boost young people\u0027s career and housing aspirations, our report shows how a new contract between generations can build a better and more unified Britain.  The commission, which was chaired by the peer alongside Frances O\u0027Grady, TUC general secretary, and Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general, called for an NHS levy funded by national insurance on the earnings of workers over the state pension age as well as on some occupational pension income. It comes after reports that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is considering putting forward proposals echoing the recommendation, a measure that would be deeply unfair, according to a Tory former pensions minister. Council tax should be abolished and a property tax introduced in its place that would include surcharges on second and empty homes but stamp duty would be halved to encourage people to move, under the report\u0027s plan. Instead of inheritance tax, benefactors would have a \u0026pound125,000 lifetime allowance, with anything above that taxed at 20% up to \u0026pound500,000 and 30% after that. The commission estimated that despite lower rates, the move would raise an extra \u0026pound5 billion initially by curbing avoidance.

The photograph of the Prime Minister was put on display last week at the university’s School of Geography and the Environment as part of a celebration of the department’s female alumnae. But following protests by students it has been removed. A Twitter account called NotAllGeographers was set up to protest the portrait. Students put up a free space asking people to share their thoughts on pieces of coloured paper surrounding the photograph of the PM who graduated with a second-class degree in 1977.  One student wrote: “School of Geography and (Hostile????) Environment” [sic], while another message said: “Let in every refugee, throw the Tories in the sea.”  Andrew Dwyer, a cyber security and geography student, wrote on social media: “(Not so) Great to see Theresa May placed alongside Doreen Massey in [the School of Geography], apparently one of the best alumnae we have. I don\u0027t really wish to celebrate a hostile environment for immigrants, if I\u0027m honest.”    The campaigning group said on Twitter:  #NotAllGeographers have creatively intervened for geographers everywhere to challenge the installation of a Theresa May portrait in Oxford Geography without consultation of the student body (at least).  This is unacceptable and does little to inspire confidence in critical thought.  The group\u0027s name builds upon a hashtag used during the recent UCU strikes distancing current students from the vice chancellors who also studied geography. The collection of photographs were chosen by past and current members of the department to “inspire the next generation of women geographers to aim high in their future careers.    #NotAllGeographers told student newspaper the Cherwell: “Clearly at a time when there are issues with the Windrush scandal and the handling of Brexit [she is] a contentious figure in a department with many EU citizens and decolonial scholars.   “The main, and most basic, issue comes with the celebration of a sitting Prime Minister. Should a department align itself with the power of the day, when there are those who actively challenge it? “It is unprecedented to celebrate state power in such a way (regardless of one’s political affiliation).  In a note alongside the picture, Mrs May – who studied at the university from 1974 to 1977 – said: “I remember the School of Geography as a great place to meet, learn and enjoy finding out more about our world… “A greater understanding of the diversity and complexity of our world and a respect for our environment, which I learnt in my degree, have stood me in good stead in my chosen career.”   The Prime Minister\u0027s spokesman said it was a matter for the college. But he pointed to her views on the importance of women in senior positions in public life and her “pride in what women have achieved in those senior positions”.

Paulina Gancarz, 34, who had been going through a bitter divorce, was five times the drink-drive limit when she was found behind the wheel of her Mini Cooper in a layby last month. The mum-of-one was arrested and bailed but on the day she was to appear in court two weeks later she was found to be more than three times the limit after she crashed her Mini outside a Marks and Spencer in Cheshire at 7am. Gancarz - who ran her own accountancy firm - wept as she admitted drink driving and failing to provide a specimen of breath at Stockport Magistrates Court. But she was spared jail after saying the offences arose from an acrimonious split with her husband which cost her \u0026pound65,000 in lawyers\u0027 fees.  Gancarz claimed her traditional Polish mother had been putting pressure on her, had been looking after her seven year old daughter and had disapproved of the divorce which saw her lose her business and subsequently get a job on a much lower salary as an accounts assistant. She said had decided to get away from her mother by sleeping overnight in her car with a bottle of wine and drive home the next day. She also said she did not know being drunk at the wheel of a parked car was an offence in the UK. The court heard the offences occurred between April 14 and April 30, two years after Gancarz broke up with her husband who is also an accountant. Prosecutor Miss Tina Cunnane said: The defendant was sat in the driver seat of her vehicle when she was stopped by the police.  They asked her to participate in a road side breath test, which she complied with and blew a reading of 182mg in 100ml of breath. They asked her to come to the station to provide another specimen but she refused so she was charged with failing to provide a specimen. The next offence occurred shortly after crashing her car, it was apparent she had been drinking alcohol. Security staff were made aware and contacted the police. On that occasion she blew a reading of 109mg in 100ml of breath. A probation report compiled by an unnamed officer was read to the court and said: Mrs Gancarz does have depression and anxiety, she is on medication for this. She went through a difficult divorce some two years ago, losing a lot of money, she lost two business and spent \u0026pound65,000 on solicitor fees.  She is working, albeit for a much lower salary, as an accounts assistant. On April 14 she had been having an issue with her mother who was over to help with her daughter, she was very depressed and she was not coping very well. Mrs Gancarz\u0027s mother came to visit her from Poland. She was not happy with her situation and the fact she was looking after her daughter on her own following the divorce. She was coming to help her with the situation but they have a difficult relationship. She put a lot of pressure of her. Her parents are quite traditional. Things like when she was married, she was in a good position financially, they were more supportive yet when she was divorced the attitude of her parents changed a lot. She wasn\u0027t coping very well. On the 14th she was going to go and buy a bottle of wine so that she could escape for a while. She parked in a lay-by in Wilmslow and there she said her intention was to drink the wine, sleep in her car and go home the next day.

Harry Butt has been left with severe concussion, a swollen nose and a huge black eye after the ball hit him in the face with a dramatic thud, knocking him to the floor. His family say he\u0027s been suffering from hearing and eyesight problems since the ball smashed into him after flying over the fence while he was at a friend\u0027s house. Horror footage of the incident shows the moment the child was knocked to the floor from the dramatic impact of the ball. The family are demanding safety improvements at Poole Grammar School in Dorset, saying The next victim might not be so lucky. They have been backed by residents of the area, who are demanding something is done before someone else is seriously injured, or worse. The school has said it is the first such incident to happen, but said it is one incident too many, confirming they are reviewing the scheduling of matches on their pitches.  Michelle, of Canford Heath, Dorset, had taken Harry and her 12-year-old twin daughters to visit friends before heading off on a holiday camping trip to Weymouth. They were on the driveway of the house saying goodbye when the ball whistled past Michelle\u0027s ear and struck Harry. She said It sounded like a bomb had gone off - my little boy was on the floor. We were all in shock and he was dazed. We took him to A\u0026ampE and we were admitted to hospital. He was violently sick, had really bad concussion and the consultant said if it had hit him anywhere else, he wouldn\u0027t be here. It hit him on the forehead, on the side. Harry, who goes to Ad Astra Infant School, was allowed home, with Michelle under strict instructions to keep a close eye on him for the next fortnight and to return to hospital if she\u0027s worried. She has already been back once as he now has two black eyes, cannot breathe through his nose as it is so swollen, and is having trouble hearing.  We are on day five and he\u0027s not himself, he\u0027s crying every night. I\u0027m still in shock - I still hear the noise. It\u0027s just awful and I want something done. The school called Michelle who claims they said they could not raise the height of the fence due to health and safety, as the site was \u0027too windy\u0027. But she said they told her they would move future cricket matches to an alternative field. Michelle claimed residents of Haslar Road had been complaining for years about cricket balls coming over the fence and hitting their cars, conservatories and ending up on their roofs.

Beaches, parks and countryside hotspots across the country have been left covered with litter after millions of sunseekers descended on them. Plastic rubbish, nappies, windbreakers and disposable barbecues are among the many used items left scattered along the UK\u0027s coastline. Takeaway boxes, empty cans of beer, food packets and plastic bags have also been dumped by visitors who failed to put them in the bin. Photos of the post-holiday mess have sparked outrage, with many people accusing \u0027disrespectful\u0027 litterers of \u0027ruining\u0027 beauty spots for others.  Taking to Twitter this morning, one disappointed woman expressed her shock at the state of the beach in Blackpool, Lancashire. She wrote: Cannot believe how much rubbish was all over Blackpool beach after bank holiday! Like the aftermath of a festival. There are bins at every set of steps up and down the prom, there is no excuse for this. All of this is going to end up in the sea. Meanwhile, comedian Joe Lycett shared a picture of the mess in Birmingham\u0027s Cannon Hill Park, as he urged people to use bins. Joe, 29, tweeted: Hate to sound like your mother but if you enjoyed the beauty of Cannon Hill Park yesterday then the least you can do is respect it and the safety of the animals that live in it by putting your rubbish in a bin. Here’s a selfie I took with your mess!!!  Today, volunteers were left having to litter-pick at beauty spots after tonnes of debris were dumped at the sites instead of being put in bins. Some residents, shocked by the appalling state of their local beaches, called for the introduction of a dedicated litter police to fine those flouting the rules. Some of the worst scenes were in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, where hundreds of plastic water bottles had been left behind on the beach. The sand was barely visible over the weekend due to the amount of visitors - but the aftermath has been dubbed a disgrace. PC Daryl Jones tweeted: Now there\u0027s nothing more I love than a day off...especially when the sun is shining. However if you come to our town to enjoy the weather please tidy up your rubbish!!!!!!! There is no excuse.    He accompanied the post with a picture of the litter-covered coastline. Another local said: We could have signs on the beach saying how would you like it if we came into your home stayed for the day and left our rubbish on your floor with a picture of a seagull with a beer pack holder round their neck. And the shocking scene was repeated across the country. In Barry Island, south Wales, angry locals called for the introduction of patrolling litter police with the power to hand out fines. Rob Weaver said: We need litter police with the power to fine, or remove people from the beach. Another added: If you\u0027ve left any rubbish on the beach at Barry Island today then you should be ashamed of yourselves. Disgusting.  Yesterday evening, community volunteers Friends of Barry Beaches posted on Facebook about the disgusting behaviour of some visitors. They wrote: After a fabulous bank holiday, we thought we’d take a walk over Barry Island. At 6.30pm the beach was still full, but signs of the litter people had discarded was clear to see already. The only word to describe the behaviour of these inconsiderate visitors is disgusting. What is wrong with you? If you had turned up this morning to a beach covered in rubbish , would you have stayed? The answer is no. You came to the beach to experience the beautiful sandy beach and sea in the sunshine and enjoy the delights of Barry Island. Please have the decency to leave it the way you found it. Facebook user Paige Jones shared the post, writing: People are disgusting!!! Ruin it for everyone because they can’t put rubbish in the bin. Instead they would rather it wash out to sea or blow all over land.    She added: Anywhere I can apply to be part of the rubbish police \u0026amp kick these people up the butt. Earlier, a mum had warned that she had found a needle on the beach at Barry Island when the tide was out. She said her little girl was inches from standing on it. Meanwhile, at Botany Bay in Kent, bins were left overflowing with trash. One upset visitor said: The price we pay for tourism. Others were upset by the state of nearby Margate beach, which was also left littered in plastic waste. Margate beach looks f****** disgusting with all people\u0027s rubbish just left on it from the long weekend, one local Tweeted. People wonder why and how we are killing our sea and the animals in and out of it.  People need to grow up and take responsibility for what they are doing to it. Others lamented the amount of plastic left on Branksome Beach near Poole, Dorset, where hundreds of items of plastic were left following the weekend\u0027s heatwave. And Bournemouth beach was also badly affected, with many people even leaving their fold-up chairs in the shadow of the pier. Twitter account Bournemouth Litter - set up to highlight the town\u0027s growing litter problem - posted several heartbreaking images of plastic water bottles and beer cans on the area\u0027s seven miles of golden sands. Rubbish bins were also overflowing with junk. The account Tweeted: The morning after the bank holiday. At least the bins are being used, but they now dominate the walkways and views on the beach.    Deano Leith posted a picture of a seagull picking among litter left on Scarborough beach, North Yorkshire, on Sunday. He added: So much litter on the beach! People really don\u0027t give a monkeys about their waste. So much plastic left behind for the tide to take away. Bins overflowing the whole place is a disgrace. It\u0027s a damn shame. Keep Britain Tidy Chief Executive Allison Ogden-Newton said: On a gorgeous bank holiday thousands of us flock to our beaches and parks because they are beautiful, clean and great places to enjoy the sunshine with our families. But some people seem to think it is acceptable to walk away at the end of the day, leaving their rubbish behind and destroying the very beauty they went there to enjoy.  It is not, neither can we use the excuse that \u0027the bins were full\u0027. If the bins are full, then you should take your rubbish home with you. You took it there, you take it away again. Those thoughtless people who leave their litter are damaging our environment for everyone. Dr Sue Kinsey, Senior Pollution Policy Officer at the Marine Conservation Society said: It\u0027s a shame that such a beautiful few days at the beach were spoiled by so much rubbish being left thoughtlessly behind. These pictures highlight the need for urgent action on plastics including the introduction of a deposit return scheme for all sizes of containers - plastic, glass and metal, levies and charges on items such as cups and straws and banning of certain plastics altogether such as polystyrene and black plastic.

Claire Upshall, now 28, went to work at an orphanage in 2009, where she fell in love with little orphan Alfie, then aged one. She travelled back to the UK when her seven weeks were up, but she couldn\u0027t get Alfie out of her mind and within weeks she quit her job and headed back to Africa. There she began to care for 200 orphaned or abandoned children. And over just a 13 month stretch she adopted Alfie and three more children from orphanages - Layla and Isabella, now both eight, and Jack, now five.  Single mum Claire is now amid a \u0026pound34,000 battle to get her family to the UK. Unable to find work in Tanzania she has just weeks of savings left, and is crowdfunding to pay for the flights, visas and paperwork to get back to the UK where she\u0027ll get work. Claire from Christchurch, Dorset, said: When I went out for that first trip it was a dream come true to live and work in the orphanage, constantly hearing the laughs and cries of the little ones. I developed a connection with Alfie very early on, but I didn\u0027t for a minute think I would become his mum - that was never the plan.  But I fell in love with the country, the people, the babies and more specifically, that one little boy. One by one our little family grew and I went from one to four in 13 months. It\u0027s not what I had in mind when I went out there aged 19, but it just fits and I couldn\u0027t imagine life any differently now. I always thought it would be important for my children to be in their own culture, and I still think their culture is incredibly important. But I need paid work, and can\u0027t find it, and there is a lot to be said about the importance of growing up around your extended family.  I made that decision in late 2014 - and I\u0027ve been working towards it ever since. Claire said when she was a little girl she\u0027d talk about her dream of looking after the babies in Africa. She was working as a nanny when she flew to Tanzania on New Year\u0027s Eve 2009 for seven weeks after Googling \u0027African baby home\u0027. \u0027New kid\u0027 Alfie, then 13-month-old was placed in her arms and she soon made it her personal mission to get the serious little toddler to smile I spent a lot of time caring for him and after a couple of weeks he started smiling at me - but only me, she said.  Now that serious little boy is my eldest son. She was in floods of tears when it was time to come home in February 2009, and within weeks she\u0027d quit her job to return for a further five weeks with Alfie and the kids. It helped her make up her mind to come home to the UK and work for a year to fund a longer stretch abroad. After a year as a live-in nanny, she moved back to Tanzania in May 2011, to manage the orphanage, in charge of 20 staff and up to 54 babies at a time. Little Alfie had been moved to another orphanage 15km away, and she visited hoping to sponsor his education - but ended up adopting him.  Within five months he was living with me as my son. Now he\u0027s nine. He didn\u0027t speak a word of English and she spoke no Swahili at the time, but they bonded by rolling bouncy balls down the corridors of their new home. I loved him and he loved me and we just fitted together as a team. Just a couple of months later, in December 2011, two-year-old Layla was welcomed into the family. \u0027Girly girl\u0027 Layla could no longer be cared for by her parents, and had met Claire during her first volunteering stint, when she was just five-months-old.  Claire would often short-term foster particularly vulnerable and malnourished children from the orphanage, to give them round the clock care. Just three months after her brood grew to two, she was called to pick up a tiny girl from a nearby village, who could no longer be cared for by her parents. Claire was told the 10lb \u0027baby\u0027 was five-months-old, but she turned out to be an extremely malnourished two-year-old. Caring Claire took her in full-time to give her the best chance of survival and four months on, in July 2012, Isabella, now eight, was officially handed over to Claire. She just instantly fit in and was part of the family, said Claire.  I sort of thought \u0027what\u0027s another one?\u0027, you know. Six months on Claire moved to Arusha, Tanzania, to set up a new baby orphanage in March 2012. She met 4lb abandoned baby Jack, then ten days old, eight months later when she picked him up from hospital. Jack was so small he needed to be woken up to feed, and needed constant warmth, so Claire carried him in a \u0027kangaroo\u0027 sling while she worked in the office. Waking up through the night to feed him cemented their bond, and she adopted him eight months later in August 2013. In 13 months I went from caring for one to caring for four, she said. Sometimes when I think about it, I realise it is a bit crazy, but it just fitted and felt right.  Ever since I was a young girl I wanted a big family. When I got Alfie I did think \u0027two and I\u0027ll stop\u0027, but it just happened and it worked, and my childhood wish came true. With four children to look after, she left the orphange to support her super-sized family and has been searching for paid work ever since. The four children are now thriving at school, and Claire is almost fluent in Swahili, but she has found it impossible to find work. She has relied on regular payments from her parents, Helen, 63, a catering worker, and Derek, 65, a retired carpenter, who passed away earlier this year. She has also returned home for short work stints when money was particularly tight, and has been helped by friends and family back in the UK.

Carys Pickles is allergic to everything from sunshine to ice cream and she can\u0027t be out in the sun for five minutes without being covered in itchy red hives. Mum Sophie, 25, said she lives in fear of what Carys might react to next after the little girl has been rushed to hospital several times with life-threatening reactions. Little Carys has had severely sensitive skin since she was born and she also reacts to the chlorine in swimming pools, sun tan lotion, grass, and even some ice-cream, due to an intolerance to cow\u0027s milk.   Poor Carys wasn\u0027t even able to enjoy a family barbeque this bank holiday weekend - because of a severe allergy to tomato ketchup that her pals would be smearing all over their burgers and hot dogs .  Sophie has been forced to cancel their summer holiday this year in fear that Carys will have a potentially fatal reaction abroad. When she was five-days-old we had to call an ambulance because she had a reaction to milk, and they\u0027ve just got worse since. Now, the family, including dad Liam, 30, and sisters Amelia, five, and Phoebe, nine-months-old, from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, are searching for ways her daughter can be pain-free for the next few months.  Sophie, a stay-at-home mum, said: Summer is meant to be the most exciting time of year for kids, but for Carys it\u0027s one of the most dangerous times. Ever since she was born she\u0027s been allergic to a lot of things, but over the past year it\u0027s got even worse. We\u0027re dreading the summer because there\u0027s so many precautions that we have to take to make sure she\u0027s not in pain. She\u0027s even allergic to sun tan lotion, so we have to use a special one for her, and swimming pools, so she can\u0027t go in there to cool down. And we have to be careful at BBQs in case Carys gets hold of tomato ketchup, as she will come out in a rash.  Despite Carys\u0027 allergy to the sunshine only being identified last year, she has suffered with reactions since she was born. And after being rushed to hospital several times with life-threatening reactions, Sophie now lives in fear of what her daughter will react to next. She added: Every day it seems there\u0027s something new that Carys reacts to, and it\u0027s a constant fear of how bad the next reaction will be. When she was five-days-old we had to call an ambulance because she had a reaction to milk, and they\u0027ve just got worse since.  It started off as her just getting red patches across her body, but now she can get completely swollen from head-to-toe in five minutes. When she\u0027s in the sun she not only burns from the heat in minutes , but we also have to keep her at a constant temperature otherwise she will overheat and start to swell. So we have to make sure she\u0027s covered by umbrellas, has a fan on her and is kept completely cool if she leaves the house, because we don\u0027t want to take her to the hospital again! She can\u0027t even lay on the grass and make daisy chains because the grass brings her out in painful hives.

She has gathered 40,000 hearts sent by 450 knitters around the world in a remarkable display of empathy and compassion. An army of knit-one-pearl-one volunteers responded after Clare said the hobby helped her cope with the death of husband Ken, 47. The pair, both divorcees, had met through Friends Reunited Dating 14 years ago.  They went on to marry but seeing Ken fighting for his last breath with bowel cancer has left Clare, 51, with post traumatic stress disorder and acute anxiety. She took up knitting at the suggestion of her therapist. Clare, from Gloucester, started producing knick-knacks for the Sue Ryder Leckhampton Court Hospice in Cheltenham – which cared for Ken in his final weeks.  Then she and 25 pals “yarn bombed” a tree in the hospice gardens, with woollen characters representing the staff. Clare says: “That took us three months. We crept in overnight and were a local news story: the ‘Gloucestershire Banksy’.” The Royal Horticultural Society then invited Clare to create a Work of Heart healing garden at the RHS Malvern Spring Festival from May 10-13.  That’s when it went into overdrive – she posted her story on Facebook and the hearts poured in. Now visitors to the show can buy one and hang it in an avenue of trees in memory of a relative. Clare has even created yarn pots and plants and a detailed woollen version of the room where Ken was cared for. She adds: “My aim was to raise \u0026pound50,000 to mark what would have been Ken’s 50th. I explained my story and how much this project and the hospice meant to me. I stored the hearts in my front room.

According to insiders workers repairing the roof of Apartment 1, Kensington Palace, were instructed to complete the job quickly, as Prince Harry made it clear him and Meghan plan to start a family soon. Royal courtiers were last year keen to let it be known that the couple would immediately be living at Nottingham Cottage - Harry’s batchelor pad in the grounds of the Kensington Palace - for the foreseeable future. But insiders have known for some time that it was always Harry\u0027s intention to move out of the cosy two-bed Nott Cott as soon as possible and into Apartment 1 - a stunning 21-room wing of the palace.  It was revealed yesterday that the Duke of Gloucester agreed to move out of Apartment 1 shortly after the engagement to allow Harry and Meghan to move in. The Daily Mail\u0027s Royal expert Richard Kay wrote: “Soon after their engagement, the Queen’s cousin Richard — the Duke of Gloucester, 73 — whose three children are now grown up, offered to vacate his splendid 21-room Apartment 1 at the palace so Harry and Meghan could have it — it is next door to William and Kate. The question was, where would the Gloucesters go? “Now the problem has been solved with the departure of the Queen’s private secretary, Sir Christopher Geidt. This has freed up his smaller but very comfortable apartment, seen as ideal for the unfussy Gloucesters, who still carry out many official duties.    The Queen has allowed father-of-two Sir Christopher, 56, to stay on for six months at the prestigious address until the end of the school year. “So when will Harry and Meghan move in? Well, it was more than a year after their wedding before William and Kate moved into Princess Margaret’s old home. “Right now Meghan and Harry are content with the intimate comforts of Nottingham Cottage, with its open fire and chintzy furnishings. Meghan’s influence is everywhere — cashmere throws, scented candles and vases of fresh flowers. “They are putting off as long as possible the dreaded time when they will have to have umpteen servants.  They borrow staff from Clarence House to help out when they really need them for dinner parties. Neither of them is a very good cook. “This extends to cleaning the cottage. Rather than have their own staff, they are using contract cleaners Mitie, the company that ‘does’ the royal palaces. “At the same time, they have been slipping away from the bustle of London to the relative peace of Windsor, where a bolthole at the castle has been made available for their occasional use as they prepare for what will be one of the most microscopically observed occasions of recent times.” Harry and Meghan certainly seem to be in rather a hurry to get a family started. The pace of their romance has been swift to say the least in Royal terms.  Harry spoke back in November of last year about the speed at which he fell for Meghan - it was love at first sight, he said. Lifting the lid on their whirlwind romance, he said \u0027the stars were aligned\u0027 when \u0027this beautiful woman fell into my life\u0027. Harry, 33, also promised he and the American actress, 36, will start a family \u0027in the near future\u0027. The compact cottage is no place for a young prince and his bride to plan for a family. And this might well explain the pace at which work has been rattling on at Apartment 1.  As news crew gathered on last November on the east side of Kensington Palace, it almost seemed as if workers on the roof on the west side of the building were trying to hurriedly remove the gleaming white plastic covering in double quick time so as not to draw attention to renovations. Beneath the sheets it was plain to see that renovations to the roof of Apartment 1 had been happening at lightening quick pace after only a few weeks with new mortar pointing over the chimney stacks clearly visible. Panoramic pictures of the Kensington Palace back then showed the world\u0027s media on the east side of the palace while work on Apartment 1 rattled along unnoticed on the west side of the building. Pictures taken in November showed the entire Apartment 1 still shrouded in white tarpaulins.  Apartment 1 adjoins the 20-room Apartment 1A which Harry’s brother Prince William and his growing family live in. William and Kate also lived at Nottingham Cottage before they started a family - it almost seems like a right of passage for the two Royal brothers. Work on apartment 1 is now almost completed - just in time for Harry\u0027s wedding to Meghan in less than two weeks’ time. The Gloucesters also have other properties they can happily spend time at. A source said: “The Gloucesters have two other properties: Barnwell Manor in Northamptonshire, which they rent out, and a weekend cottage in Gloucestershire, which they could retire to.”  Several years ago a royal spokesman said that Harry had set his sights on grander accommodation at Kensington Palace but refused to confirm which apartment it was, other than to say it was currently occupied. In 2014, another member of the family, Princess Michael, suggested in an interview with Tatler magazine that Apartment 1 would be perfect for Harry to move in to when he got older and wanted to start a family. Princess Michael said William and Kate have a “lovely big apartment, next to the Gloucesters, who I think will leave their enormous apartment because their children have gone.” She added: “They’re rattling around this huge space and I think Prince Harry might go there. Then they’d be next door to each other - very good move.”  It has been rumoured for some time that Harry had his eyes on another larger apartment in Kensington Palace for him and Meghan to move into. The rumoured new apartment was said to be much closer to the huge wing that has been home for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge since September, when they moved back to London from Anmer Hall on the Sandringham estate to coincide with Prince George starting school in Battersea. Indeed Apartment 1 and Apartment 1A are as close together as it is possible to be - they are linked by adjoining doors so Harry and Meghan can come and go to see Kate and William and also visit young Prince George and Princess Charlotte whenever they choose. ‘It\u0027s sweet that Harry and Meghan will be living next to William and Kate. When Harry and Meghan move in permanently, it will be like when William and Harry were kids when their mother was alive - living next door to one another at Kensington Palace.

It was approached by a covered bridge, leading down a wide staircase to a spacious booking hall. The broad, sweeping platforms a quarter of a mile long could take 18-coach trains. The waiting room had a cheery coal fire, and there were always porters to help passengers. There were ornate refreshment rooms. Normanton station was a Victorian marvel. And now gone, all gone, except for a short section of platform and a bus-stop shelter for the infrequent stoppers to Leeds. The buildings were demolished, post-Beeching. No more Thames-Clyde expresses, or “all stations to Manchester Victoria”.  The station was once the heart and soul of a community, a place of bustle, business, comings and goings to far-off places. Of romance, even. It was no coincidence that Brief Encounter, that most English of romantic movies, was filmed around a station, Carnforth, where Scots flyers thundered through. Today’s stations are either soulless halts or shopping centres from which trains are reluctantly permitted to depart. They bear testimony to the age of coffee shop chains and fashion boutiques. Perhaps this is what travellers want. A Transport Focus survey makes revamped Birmingham New Street the third-best station in the country – the final triumph of retail over railway. There are dozens of shops selling things I don’t want to buy, but the trains still go from cramped, chilly, underground platforms with nowhere to sit and bewildered passengers milling about trying to find escape routes. Kings Cross in London was the most-liked. It may be an architectural masterpiece, but it’s junk if you are on a journey. Not enough seats, and crowds staring miserably at a monster departure board that barely gives you enough time to catch your train.  Maybe that’s because privatised operators are in cahoots with retailers to keep us herded into the shopping precinct. St Pancras is rated second-best. Have you ever tried getting through the wheelie-suitcase warriors there? Lucky to escape with no more than a bruised shin. And don’t try to find the local services. They are in another place altogether, with fewer shops because commuters don’t have time to buy the chainstore rubbish on sale to Eurostar travellers. Give me an honest-to-goodness station where the trains are more important than “the retail experience”. A station like Grade 1-listed Huddersfield, whose classical facade makes the proudest architectural statement on the system.  It has two pubs, proper boozers with proper beer and railway paintings on the wall and drinkers who look as if they might be going to Newcastle (another great station). And there is a station cat. Stations are – or should be – places of glamour. I like to land in magnificent Bristol Temple Meads knowing I could go to Bodmin, Dawlish, Abergavenny, Ludlow, Haverfordwest or Great Malvern. But not Cardiff, which is not the station of a nation. Or back to bloody New Street. Or Derby – characterless despite a makeover. No, give me the great shambles that is Preston. Or Hull Paragon, which just about manages to retain some of the virtues from which it takes its name. Or Glasgow Central, a real terminus, the end of the line from England - now the only one since the closure of Buchanan Street and St Enoch (the site of a huge shopping centre: an honest transformation, at least).

She was a successful actress with a leading role in one of America\u0027s biggest legal dramas, which is now heading towards its eighth season. But it wasn\u0027t an easy ride to the top for Meghan, and she had to work her way through a number of other roles before getting her big break. She was also told she was not thin enough, not pretty enough and not ethnic enough along the way, which really affected her confidence.  But she proved them wrong and she did it, going on to become a huge star - and she\u0027s understandably extremely proud of her achievments. To celebrate her own success she decided to treat herself to the \u0026pound5,000 Cartier Tank Francaise watch - and had a powerful message engraved on the back to remind her of her achievements.  During an interview with Hello! magazine back in 2015 she explained why the watch means so much to her.   She said: I\u0027ve always coveted the Cartier French Tank watch. When I found out Suits had been picked up for our third season – which, at the time, felt like such a milestone – I totally splurged and bought the two-tone version. She had the back engraved with the message \u0027To M.M. From M.M\u0027. She went on: I plan to give it to my daughter one day. That’s what makes pieces special, the connection you have to them.   Meghan will marry Prince Harry at Windsor Castle on May 19.   It was revealed last week that she won\u0027t have a maid of honour or any grown up bridesmaids.   Her dad Thomas will be walking her down the aisle , but Meghan will travel to the church with her mum Doria.

Apart from London cab drivers no one had heard of - or cared about - this dark and damp tube of brick and tiles. All that changed on May Bank holiday weekend in 2008 when the graffiti artist Banksy showed up with an exhibition he called the Cans Festival (yes that\u0027s spray cans not Cannes in the South of France - get it?) A week beforehand the mysterious artist sent a message out to a select group of about 40 like minded \u0027street artists\u0027 from around the world - they needed to be in London to help Banksy and no one was going to turn down an invite from the biggest name in graffitti.  2008 was a big year for London and the world. The iPhone had just been launched - most people were still calling on fat Nokias or even using landlines. While Facebook and Twitter existed user numbers were tiny and Instagram was still two years away. Come September 2008 global stock markets would crash and banks would need billions of our money to bail them out.  As Banksy sent his call to arms Mercy by Duffy was number one in the charts. London had been suffering a knife crime epidemic, the Chinese government had been suppressing democracy protests in Tibet and and Prime Minister Gordon Brown had just seen his Labour Party hammered in the local elections by a Tory party run by David Cameron . His fellow Tory Boris Johnson was hatching a plan to become London Mayor. On 24 April Leake Street was boarded up with a sign warning people to keep out as it was \u0027closed for essential maintenance work\u0027. No one would have suspected the mega-star spray painter was behind the hoardings with a group of fellow artists creating soon-to-be famous, albeit temporary, works of art.  One of those on Banksy\u0027s invite list was Charles Uzzell-Edwards who paints under the name \u0027Pure Evil\u0027. He explained: No one knew what it was but it was coming from Banksy and it was going to be big. Then we got the call to meet at a hotel and everyone was brought into a conference room where we were shown plans of Leake Street and how they planned it would look - everyone was allocated a bit of wall to work on. I went back to my studio to pick up my paint and stencils and before I knew it I was painting with Banksy working a few yards behind me.  It was an extraordinary moment - many great artists from all over the world had come together, looking back I guess it was a seminal moment, whatever that means.  There were the guys from Massive Attack (Robert Del Naja), Blek le Rat, these were huge names and everyone worked through the night - the opening party was quite something.  As Uzzell-Edwards hints at this wasn\u0027t a bunch of kids showing up to make a mess of some walls - this was planned and with permission of the tunnel\u0027s owners, hotel rooms had been booked, security was in place and of course a few words were released to the press the day before it was opened to the public to tempt them in. Banksy said: Graffiti doesn\u0027t always spoil buildings, in fact it\u0027s the only way to improve a lot of them. In a few hours with a couple of hundred cans of paint, I\u0027m hoping we can transform a dark, dirty, neglected hell hole into an oasis of beautiful art.  I\u0027ve always felt anyone with a paint can should have as much say in how our cities look as architects and ad men.  So getting to cover an entire street with graffiti is a dream come true, or as some people might call it — a complete and utter nightmare.  As well as well established artists, Banksy picked a few unknowns to come along - among them was a young Portuguese artist called Alexandre Farto who paints under the tag Vhils. He was living in South London at the time and getting invited to the Cans was a big moment for him - not least he was given a bit of wall to work on right next to where Banksy was making his \u0027Cave Painting\u0027.  As Uzzell-Edwards explained: He pitched up with a jack hammer and a scary expression on his face and everyone was amazed by what he did - no one had seen him before.  A picture of Vhils \u0027Chisel Face\u0027 made the front Page of The Times on the Saturday of the Cans festival. Since then he\u0027s travelled the world carving faces in to walls and his latest collaboration was with the man behind the famous Obama \u0027Hope\u0027 election campaign poster Shepard Fairey.  Come 10am on the Saturday morning, with the festival well promoted in the press, thousands turned up with huge queues to get in.  It really did have a festival feel about it - there were bizarre moments too - Jason Donovan showed up on a moped to have a look around.  At the end of the tunnel an area of \u0027free wall\u0027 was left so anyone with a spray can and some stencils could make their mark. Within days the free wall was covered and most of the art works by the big names had been \u0027improved\u0027 by passers by - it\u0027s what Banksy wanted.  People always like to speculate on Banksy\u0027s identity - is he an individual or a group of people cleverly marketing a movement?

But the outbreak was declared over in 2016. Now the Congo has confirmed two new cases of Ebola in Bikoro, with ten more cases suspected in the country.  The news has sparked fears that the deadly virus could be back, just a few years after it swept across West Africa from 2014 to 2016 killing at least 11,000 people. It\u0027s the ninth time Ebola has been recorded in DRC, whose river gave the deadly virus its name when it was first discovered in the 1970s. With an incubation period between 2 and 21 days, it\u0027s possible for people to be infected without knowing it. As new cases of Ebola are reported, we take a look at what the deadly virus actually is and how it spreads - as well as the risk.  What is Ebola? The Ebola virus is among the most lethal diseases known to man. There is no vaccine, no cure, and it kills 90% of infected patients. It\u0027s an infectious and frequently fatal disease marked by fever and severe internal bleeding, spread through contact with infected body fluids by a filovirus. It was first discovered in Zaire, today the Democratic Republic of Congo, in 1976. The name came from the Ebola river as the first cases were reported in the area.  Outbreaks typically occur in remote villages in Central and West Africa, near tropical rainforests. The spread of the disease is worsened by mistrust of western medicine in some African communities. In March 2017 Sierra Leone was declared Ebola free, so the news the Congo has new cases has caused unrest. Ebola statistics About 28,000 cases were reported and 11,000 deaths recorded by the World Health Organisation in the 2014-2016 outbreak.  The f irst two known outbreaks in 1976 caused 318 cases and 280 deaths in Zaire, and 284 cases and 151 deaths in Sudan.  The average case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks.  How does it spread? Outbreaks start when the disease is passed to humans from wild animals. It then spreads through communities by direct contact with blood, bodily fluids or corpse of an infected person. Ebola is believed to spread over long distances thanks to bats, who host the virus without dying. It then infects other animals it shares trees with,like monkeys. It then often spreads to humans via infected bushmeat. These are the main ways it spreads  Directly touching a body of someone who has just died from the virus Cleaning up bodily fluids or touching soiled clothing of the infected Handling unsterilised needles or medical equipment used on infected people Having sex with an infected person Handling or eating raw or uncooked bushmeat   Symptoms of Ebola Symptoms occur between two to 21 days after becoming infected.  High temperature Headache Join and muscle pain Sore throat Severe muscle weakness Diarrhoea Vomiting Rash Stomach pain Reduced kidney and live function follow In the final stages a person may bleed internally, then from the ears, eyes, nose and mouth  Is there a treatment? There\u0027s still no licensed treatment or vaccine for Ebola, although potential ones are being tested. Is there still a risk?  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office no longer advises against all but essential travel to previously affected areas. This may now change with news of the Congo cases.  People who were most at risk were those who care for infected people or handle their blood or fluid, such as hospital workers, laboratory workers and family members.  Advice for the Congo is here .   For up-to-date travel advice check here .  The NHS says: The risk of an Ebola outbreak occurring in the UK remains negligible. Where were cases of Ebola reported? A large outbreak occurred in 2014-15. In June 2016, the outbreak was officially declared over. The outbreak was mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Some cases also occurred in parts of Central Africa. Now there are two new cases reported in the Congo and a further 10 suspected cases.  Where did the 2014 outbreak begin?  The epidemic is thought to have begun in Guinea in March, before spreading to Liberia and Sierra Leone. It was the worst outbreak of the disease on record, according to the World Health Organisation, who say it infected 1201 people and killed 672.  The spread of the disease was thought to have quickened due to local people mistrusting medical teams. Some believe the outbreak was a hoax - or even that health workers were killing patients. Who survived? British nurse Pauline Cafferkey   British nurse Pauline Cafferkey made headlines around the world after she contracted the disease while working to treat the sick. She made her first brave return to Sierra Leone this time last year. Photos of her visit shocked people around the world, as the town of Lunsar is now crumbling.

The helpless pooch, named Braveheart, was slowly bleeding to death when rescuers discovered her near a slaughterhouse in Zhejiang province. It\u0027s thought her front two paws had been sawn off by a butcher as part of China\u0027s dog meat trade. Footage of the moment rescuers came to her aid shows the two-year-old mixed breed crying out in pain while covered in blood. But just a few months later, Braveheart has been given a new lease of life after being flown to the UK for pioneering treatment.  Braveheart learned to walk on a set of prosthetic legs while being suspended in a body support. She was then given a brand new set of wheels to help her get around before being welcomed into a loving new home with Amanda Leask, 48, from Edinburgh. Amanda said: This dog is a survivor in every sense of the word. I truly believe her tenacious appetite to survive brought her through mentally. Speaking about Braveheart\u0027s new surroundings, Amanda said she\u0027s loving playing in the countryside.  She added: She\u0027s loving the fresh country air, the peace and tranquility the countryside gives, the soft grass she can actually walk on using what\u0027s left of her little limbs. She\u0027s in good company here. This girl is easing in gently to a new and exciting life. Braveheart\u0027s life-saving treatment involved her having both front legs amputated to avoid catching a potentially fatal infection.
