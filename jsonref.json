A blistering parliamentary speech by the then prime minister, Julia Gillard, calling him out as sexist, became an internet phenomenon in 2012.“I just find this appointment absolutely staggering,” Thornberry said. “On a personal level, I am disgusted that Boris Johnson thinks this offensive, leering, cantankerous, climate change-denying, Trump-worshipping misogynist is the right person to represent our country overseas.“He was ousted by his own colleagues after two years in power, and kicked out of Australian politics by his own constituents just last year. They are the people who know him best, and they wanted rid of him – yet here we are, hiring him to negotiate our trade deals around the world. If it wasn’t so downright humiliating, it would be almost hilarious.”It was unclear whether Abbott would be an adviser, or would chair the board, alongside the trade secretary, Liz Truss. The board of trade is meant to advise the government as it negotiates new post-Brexit trade relationships.While making no comment on the reports about Abbott’s role, Truss announced appointments to 11 new business advisory committees on Wednesday, which she said would be “bringing British industry from farmers to carmakers closer to our negotiations”.Truss’s department is widely seen as in the firing line in No 10’s overhaul of Whitehall. The Foreign Office is already swallowing up the Department for International Development, and Johnson was known to have been frustrated when he was foreign secretary that he did not have the task of negotiating trade deals.As well as criticism of Abbott’s controversial views, there were also questions about whether the former leader has the expertise for a senior trade role, with complex negotiations looming.Mike Rann, a former Australian high commissioner to the UK, told Politico: “Britain asking Tony Abbott to run its trade negotiations would be about as credible as Australia asking Gavin Williamson to take charge of its education system.”In 2016, Abbott wrote a piece in the Times recommending British voters choose to stay in the EU rather than vote for Brexit.“Any British decision to withdraw from the European Union would have seismic consequences,” he wrote. “There’s much to dislike about the EU but very little that would be improved if Britain left.”It did not take long after the vote to leave for Abbott to say he was “quietly thrilled” with the result and recant his former Brexit scepticism, becoming an enthusiastic supporter.Abbott received recognition in this year’s Queen’s birthday honours list, being made a companion of the Order of Australia (AC) “for eminent service to the people and Parliament of Australia, particularly as prime minister, and through significant contributions to trade, border control, and to the Indigenous community”.At the time, he said: “This award doesn’t mark the end of my public service, it’s just that it now takes a different form, and I wear a number of different uniforms to do it.”Abbott, who was ousted as prime minister by his colleague Malcolm Turnbull in 2015, was then turfed out of federal parliament last year when he lost his Sydney seat of Warringah in the election.London-born Abbott, who moved to Australia when he was two years old and later studied at Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar in the 1980s, has previously been effusive about the shared bonds of English-speaking countries.Speaking at the Oxford Union debating society in 2019, he said failing to implement Brexit would represent “defeat on an epic scale, hardly matched since the Norman invasion”.He struck up a close relationship with the UK PM when Johnson was foreign secretary. When Johnson won last year’s Tory leadership contest, Abbott tweeted that “he has the courage and the passion to keep Britain great”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f3b18e8cc7d077b90e0d2b94be03ec62ff83079/0_382_5676_3404/master/5676.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba6fddb626259531645a3dc70f41b6e4","title":"marieke lucas rijneveld wins international booker for the discomfort of evening","story":"The 29-year-old Dutch author becomes youngest winner of £50,000 prize, for ‘virtuosic’ debut with translator Michele HutchisonThe 29-year-old Dutch author Marieke Lucas Rijneveld has become the youngest author ever to win the International Booker prize, taking the award for their “visceral and virtuosic” debut novel, The Discomfort of Evening.Rijneveld, whose preferred pronouns are theythem, beat titles including Yōko Ogawa’s The Memory Police and Shokoofeh Azar’s The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree to win the £50,000 award for the best fiction translated into English, which will be split equally with their translator, Michele Hutchison. At 29, Rijneveld is the youngest winner of the International Booker, and narrowly older than the youngest Booker winner, Eleanor Catton, who was 28 when she won the 2013 prize for The Luminaries.A bestseller in the Netherlands, The Discomfort of Evening follows Jas, a girl in a devout Christian farming family, whose brother dies in an accident after she wishes he would die instead of her rabbit. Lost in grief, her family falls apart as she becomes involved in increasingly dangerous fantasies.Like Jas, Rijneveld grew up in a strict religious community in a rural area of the Netherlands like Jas, their 10-year-old brother died when they were three. Already an award-winning author in the Netherlands, Rijneveld continues to work on a dairy farm, although not that of their parents. “Farming keeps me grounded. The cows are my best friends I like cleaning out the stables and shovelling the shit,” they said in an interview earlier this year.Receiving the prize on Wednesday, Rijneveld said: “I can only say that I am as proud as a cow with seven udders” and called it “a great honour”.In their acceptance speech, Rijneveld said they wrote the words “be relentless” on the wall above their desk while writing their novel.“Today, when the world has been turned upside down and is showing its dark side, I often remember those words. So, write, read, win, lose, love each other, but be relentless in this,” they said.Although the book was published in Dutch in 2018, Rijneveld’s parents had yet to read The Discomfort of Evening, the author told the  in March this year.“I hope that my parents will read it one day and be proud that they will understand it’s a novel, it’s not all about them. But it is probably too soon,” Rijneveld said at the time. In April, they told the New York Times that their mother had finally read it.Rijneveld describes themself not as trans, but as “in between”. “As a small child I felt I was a boy, I dressed like a boy and behaved like a boy, but children at that age are still neutral in their gender. In adolescence, when the separation became clear, I dressed like a girl and became a girl, then at 20 I went back to the boy I was at primary school,” they told the . “It’s difficult for my parents to understand that I’m not the girl that they raised. It’s not in the Bible.”Ted Hodgkinson, chair of the International Booker’s judges, said it had been an immense task to choose a winner from an “exceptional” six-strong shortlist, but that the judges were “unanimous in appreciation” for Rijneveld’s “visceral and virtuosic” novel. Altogether, the panel considered 124 books, translated from 30 languages. The novel “absolutely arrests your attention” from its first page, said Hodgkinson: “There’s something both in the intensity of that creative vision and that perspective of a child, but also the translation, that allows you into that world so immediately and so completely. It’s not a book that you can sit back from.”He called The Discomfort of Evening “shocking”. “It does deal with some very difficult aspects of life – the sudden death of a brother, a family grieving, some of the more unyielding aspects of a religious upbringing, the quite stark backdrop of a Dutch dairy farm, which can be quite a tough place for a child,” he said.“And yet, there’s something about the inquisitive gaze, that poetic perspective on those things, the ability to see in the everyday something remarkable, extraordinary. Even though it is a book that takes you through some difficult and unsettling cases, it has that ability to make the world new. And I think that is something, especially in our distracted and unsettled moment, to find fiction that has the ability to absolutely root you where you are in the irreducible truth of another life.”The International Booker is given every year to a novel or short story collection translated into English and published in the UK or Ireland, and has been won in the past by titles including Celestial Bodies by Omani author Jokha Alharthi, translated by Marilyn Booth from Arabic, and The Vegetarian by South Korean author Han Kang and her translator Deborah Smith.Hodgkinson, head of literature and the spoken word at Southbank Centre, was joined on this year’s judging panel by Lucie Campos, director of the Villa Gillet, France’s centre for international writing Jennifer Croft, who previously won the prize in 2018 for her translation of Olga Tokarczuk’s novel Flights author Valeria Luiselli and writer, poet and musician Jeet Thayil."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb4d1780e1f6418d14e417151e11fe7e094b1a8d/0_97_5169_3101/master/5169.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9251ff8108caa6a3e41b57ab1f845c4c","title":"eat out to help out 64m meals claimed in uk under scheme","story":"The “eat out to help out” scheme encouraged more people into UK restaurants last week, taking the total number of meals claimed since the beginning of August to more than 64m – the equivalent of one for nearly every person in the country.The figures released by HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs suggest the scheme – where diners can claim a half-price discount up to a maximum of £10 per head on food and non-alcoholic drink on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays in August – has provided a much-needed boost for the embattled hospitality sector.In the run-up to the end of the scheme next week, the chancellor said the figures demonstrated how popular it had been so far, with 10.5m meals claimed in the first week, rising to 35m in the second and 64m by the third.“Today’s figures continue to show that Brits are backing hospitality – with more than 64m meals discounted so far, that’s equivalent to nearly every person in the country dining out to protect jobs,” Rishi Sunak said.He said the scheme, announced in his summer statement in July, had helped to protect the jobs of almost 2 million people working in hospitality, adding: “This scheme has reminded us how much we love to dine out.”Restaurants, pubs and cafes apply the discount to a customer’s bill and then claim the money back from the government.In a reflection of its widespread take-up, HMRC said £336m had been claimed so far, indicating that consumers were receiving a discount of about £5.25 per head on average.However, the bill for the Treasury is expected to rise further, with potential to surpass the £500m Sunak had originally budgeted for, as claims are expected to keep rolling in from the 84,000 outlets taking part until a deadline for submissions at the end of September.With the UK economy in the deepest recession since records began, Sunak has come under pressure to extend the scheme to support hospitality firms. Some venues are, however, planning to continue offering discounts once the scheme ends.According to Sky News, the Grosvenor Estate, which owns property in London’s West End, plans to cut rents for restaurants in its buildings that apply £10 per head discounts until the end of September.Visitor numbers to smaller cities and seaside towns have increased most as a result of the scheme, according to a study by the Centre for Cities thinktank. However, the continued absence of office workers from many big cities has meant places like London and Manchester have benefited least.Restaurants, bars and cafes were among the hardest hit businesses by lockdown, with a higher proportion of hospitality workers furloughed than in other sectors.Despite warnings that encouraging people to eat out would accelerate the spread of the virus, the scheme is designed to boost trade as the furlough scheme is wound down."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9a5527ed8e46c7a2f669736644596caa496238f/0_166_5757_3454/master/5757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bceed1cc6320739c6c69e10f7dae0f21","title":"businesses and customers share your experiences of eat out to help out","story":"We’d like to hear to from staff, owners and customers on how they feel the scheme has beenThe government’s ‘eat out to help out’ scheme has meant more than 64m meals have been claimed since the beginning of August.When introduced, its aim was to incentivise the public to dine at restaurants by allowing customers to claim a half-price discount up to a cost of £10.

It employs about 7,000 people around the world and has just built a $1bn new campus near Manchester airport which it says has room for 10,000.Founded in 2004 with £500,000 in savings by former Phones4u executives Matt Moulding and John Gallemore to sell CDs online, the group expanded rapidly by exploiting a now closed tax loophole which allowed companies to avoid VAT on small goods, including CDs and DVDs, by posting them to the UK from the Channel Islands.Amid heavy competition from Amazon, they moved on to acquiring niche sites which were not directly in competition with the US online specialist and capitalising on their IT and logistics assets.Sales have grown from £80m in 2010 to £1.14bn in 2019. Last year, the group raised almost £1bn in debt and equity to fund expansion and earlier this year it bought two cargo planes for £80m to ensure it could transport goods internationally when conventional flights were grounded.Founder Moulding, now the company’s executive chairman, could be in line to receive £700m under a longstanding incentive plan which would pay out if the company reaches a valuation of £7.25bn by December 2022, according to Sky News which first reported the latest flotation plan.Early backers included Balderton Capital, which also invested in Wonga and Betfair, and a string of retail veterans including former Tesco chief executive Sir Terry Leahy, former Matalan boss Angus Munro and former Debenhams chief executive Terry Green as well as former House of Fraser investor Tom Hunter all of whom retain shares.Newer backers included private equity firms KKR, BlackRock, Merian Chrysalis Investments and fund manager Old Mutual Global Investors.The Hut Group has geared up for a stock market flotation on several occasions, but has previously opted for a private deal instead.This time around between £500m and £900m of new shares would be sold to institutional investors while some existing investors will cash out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74c5efd0c1ddd1ea6b9bad6caed80e9efac8e9c3/0_12_3007_1806/master/3007.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90fc86e2c845c20df62de8d011cb4d10","title":"2019 election labour brexit left keir starmer","story":"Brexit was just one manifestation of the deep ides on the left that Keir Starmer must now tackleSince the devastating 2019 general election result, few Labour members would disagree that their party’s campaign was chaotic. Confused messaging, panicky policy announcements and a forgettable slogan (“It’s time for real change”) all pointed towards that conclusion. But the messy details of the campaign are now emerging in a series of Times extracts from Left Out, a new book by two reporters from the paper, Gabriel Pogrund and Patrick Maguire. By the time of the December election, mistrust between party colleagues had already undermined Labour’s chances. Just two weeks before polling day, a new strategist was brought in to work up ideas for winning back leave voters, an alternative slogan was introduced (“We’re on your side”), and a defensive approach to targeting seats began.Brexit was a central factor in the election result, of course. It created a deep rift within the Labour left and split longtime friends and allies Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell. Those closest to the Labour leader felt that the shadow chancellor repeatedly overstepped the mark by siding with backbenchers in favour of a fresh EU referendum. Karie Murphy, Corbyn’s chief of staff, even told the authors that McDonnell “moved against both of us” and “it f****d our project”.Phew, Keir Starmer might be tempted to think. That Brexit is now being done means Labour is no longer struggling with an existential issue that calls for bold answers on national identity (at least not in England – the Scottish constitutional question still looms). That’s one intractable problem out of the way. Of course, there is still much to be done to address the lingering crisis over antisemitism in the Labour party – but one member of Labour’s ruling body has reported that, with the help of frequent online meetings, the party is clearing its backlog of disciplinary cases.And yet the difficulties facing the new Labour leadership are not so different from those encountered by Corbyn. No sooner was the Islington leftwinger elected as a champion of the membership than the party and its left flank became bitterly ided over Brexit. The leadership was pulled in one direction by MPs such as Ian Lavery, representing leave voters, and in another by Europhile Corbyn sceptics and #PCPEU (pro-Corbyn, pro-EU) members. Brexit was just one manifestation of a ide that will continue to rear its head.How to appeal to this broad coalition is one key question that Starmer needs to answer. So far as leader, he has prioritised internal change. He installed a new general secretary remarkably quickly, and he’ll be hoping to bolster his majority on Labour’s ruling body in the upcoming internal elections before implementing further reforms. Meanwhile, the frontbench has developed a consistent line for policy issues and responses to U-turns: that the government is “incompetent”.From schools reopening to getting a Brexit deal (or not), this framing will be Labour’s version of the “long-term economic plan” mantra adopted by the Tories under David Cameron. Polling suggests that this message is getting through, with Labour now level-pegging with the Conservatives on the question of which party is most competent, although the party is still lagging behind on voting intention.The leadership believes that before Labour has the right to sell its own ideas to the public, the party must be detoxified – and Starmer made to look prime ministerial in contrast to Boris Johnson’s hopeless leadership. This strategy has meant staying quiet on cultural and social issues that spark heated public debate. The party must “neutralise” such tensions in order to attract a range of voters broad enough to win power, the Labour Together review advised.The tricky aspect of this approach is that the membership also needs to be kept happy. Those who had a vote in the leadership election this year were promised a salesman who could carry forward a 2017-style Labour programme – radical but not overloaded as in 2019 – without being dragged down by the same level of party infighting or press vilification. Many of the issues members care about most deeply are the ones that Starmer would like to handle delicately. Activists have not hesitated to demand more from the new leadership’s more subdued style on issues such as migrant boat crossings. They are backed up by figures such as Manuel Cortes – head of the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA), which nominated Starmer earlier this year – who has called on the leadership to “turn up the volume”.This may be a question of timing for the leadership, but there is pressure from those who believe that forceful opposition shouldn’t need to wait.

But now, they’re acting like Trump did a great job by only having 45,000 Benghazis.”To be fair, “without Trump taking any action, millions more Americans could’ve died,” Noah said. “So, good on Republicans for seeing the glass of bleach half full.”Noah also dismantled another of the Republican party’s narrative flips: that racism is a personal issue overcome through inidual resilience hampered by the Democrats. The first night featured speeches from former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, whose parents immigrated from India and South Carolina senator Tim Scott, a black man, to tout their personal success as evidence of American – and Republican – exceptionalism. Both have inspiring stories, but Noah argued their logic was backwards, since “Haley and Scott are literally the exceptions”.The fact that Haley was one of the few minority governors, and that Scott is one of the few black senators, is “if anything, an argument for the existence of systemic racism in America, not against it,” he said.“Imagine being the sole survivor of a plane crash, looking around at the wreckage and going, ‘Wow, I wish all these other passengers could’ve persevered, and overcome this crash just like me. Shout-out to Boeing!” Noah added. “If America didn’t have a racism problem, then their achievements wouldn’t be a big deal. What I want is a world where a black man becoming a senator isn’t inspirational.”Finally, the first night of the RNC was peppered with attempts to scare voters about the risks of a Joe Biden presidency, which should be a lesson for the Democrats, Noah said, since they spent four days pitching a big-tent return to normalcy. “But it didn’t count for shit,” Noah said, since Republicans are “still saying that Joe Biden is basically Joseph Stalin with a better smile.”That, and a pitch that the Republican party “has something for everyone”, Noah concluded, summarizing the party’s platform as it appeared in the convention’s first night: “For people who feel like the country is in chaos, Trump will make it better. For people who feel like things are going fine, well, you have Trump to thank for that! If you’re a minority, racism is just a small bump on your way to an idyllic life in the suburbs. And if you’re scared of minorities, don’t worry – Trump is going to keep them out of your idyllic suburbs.”The first night of the Republican national convention “looked like a racist spelling bee”, said Stephen Colbert on the Late Show, in which speakers “replaced nuanced argument with screaming” at a single podium at the empty Andrew W Mellon auditorium in Washington.Airing live after the convention’s second night, Colbert touched on a sensitive subject for the president: poor TV viewership numbers. The first night of the Republican convention attracted 15.8 million viewers, nearly 3 million less than the first night of the Democratic convention the prior week. “Unfortunately for Trump, Nielsen doesn’t have an electoral college,” Colbert joked, “nor does it count the millions of people with their TV sets off who still heard Kimberly Guilfoyle’s tortured cries echo through their dreams.”The convention’s second night featured speakers considerably less loud than the former Fox News host’s shouted spectacle, including an address from first lady Melania Trump, who recounted her journey from Slovenian immigrant to American citizenship. “I was able to achieve my own American dream,” she said, to which Colbert added: “Partying with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell – we wish her well,” referring to the sex abuser and his alleged madam with whom the Trumps were friendly throughout the 90s.Trump frowned throughout his wife’s speech, with an expression Colbert called “I hate these recitals – which one of my children is this?”Melania also promised that, if given four more years as first lady, she would “continue to build upon Be Best,” her much-maligned anti-bullying initiative. “Just saying,” Colbert retorted, “if you have to build on it, maybe it wasn’t best.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad2ba91c551566b322ed043bf99f2bbbce001f90/0_38_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1c18f316971feaa351c3eee81f23aa2","title":"teachers and parents share your thoughts on face coverings in uk schools coronavirus","story":"We want to hear whether you or your children will be wearing a face covering in school to reduce the spread of coronavirusSecondary school pupils in Scotland have been advised to wear face coverings if it is impossible to physically distance, from Monday.

His was no dramatic entrance for Christopher Nolan’s high-concept action romp: he arrived on a folding bike and patiently waited for the doors to open. But still, it felt significant.“It is an important moment,” said Twell. “I’m super-excited. I don’t know if this is the film that will save cinema but it is wonderful to be here waiting to see a new Christopher Nolan film.”Twell and his film school friends have been watching old favourites at the cinema, including Lord of the Rings and Star Wars movies in recent weeks. “But it’s great to be here seeing something new and big,” he said.The 10.30am screening was by no means full. About a dozen film fans, mostly young men, arrived. They were greeted by friendly staff telling them the rules – face coverings had to be worn, don’t go within 2 metres of anyone not in your party, use the hand sanitisers and so on.Cinemas reopened in July but have struggled to get people through the doors. Staggered screening times, empty seats to enforce social distancing and deep cleaning routines have hampered recovery.After several studios pulled their summer releases as a result of Covid – including the new James Bond and Disney’s live action Mulan – Tenet is the first blockbuster to be released during the pandemic.Even before coronavirus, Tenet, which stars John David Washington, Robert Pattinson and Kenneth Branagh, was set to be one of the biggest releases of the year. Now, theatre chains are seeing it as their saviour.Showcase was keen to talk the launch up, of course, describing Wednesday as “the biggest day for UK cinema since lockdown” and said film fans were “flocking back” to cinemas nationwide.By lunchtime Bristol was packed with shoppers and diners but it was clear that many more people seemed interested in queuing for coffee or pizza than the Nolan film.Pam Green, who was visiting family in Bristol, paused to look at the screen times (Tenet was being shown every half an hour up to 9pm). “I think I’ll give it a few weeks and wait until everyone has seen it,” she said. “I know they’re spacing people out but I think I’ll wait until the fuss has died down.”Up at the lovely 1920s Everyman cinema on Whiteladies Road, film fans were being tempted back. Here the clientele was more mixed – families and couples.Mother and son Margaret and David Evans were among the first up the steps and through the doors making use of the sanitiser (Lights, camera, hand gel was the message on the cleansing station).The last film the family saw was Parasite, at the Everyman. “That was a different world,” said Margaret. “We’ve really missed it. This is the first time we’ve been inside to see something. I’m keen to get back to normal life as much as possible. This is a big part of that for me.”David, 16, added: “It’s an important film. They need to try and get people back. There’s nothing like the cinema. Hopefully it will be good, too.”Jon Older, an assistant director of film about to start work on the new series of the television crime drama Vera, could not remember the last movie he saw at a cinema.“I usually see a film at the cinema once a week. I like Christopher Nolan’s movies and expect great things. It’s extremely important for the industry. We’re all staggering back to work. Releasing this film now seems a bit of a gamble but you’ve got to start somewhere.”The audience figures will come later but Everyman described its pre-sales as “very encouraging” and said its teams across the country were looking forward to welcoming people back.On the Bristol harbourside, the independent Watershed venue has opted not to show the Nolan film when it reopens next week.Instead it will screen movies including the acclaimed Bait about life in a Cornish fishing village and classics such as Sunset Boulevard and North by Northwest.The Watershed cinema curator, Mark Cosgrove, said he had counted 77 screenings of Tenet in and around Bristol on day one. “Tenet is readily available for anyone who would like to see it,” he said. “It’s got enough exposure. It’s not all about tentpole releases. There are other kinds of cinema being made and other film cultures happening. That’s what we want to show.”Cosgrove said Watershed’s advance ticket sales were healthy. “It’s a nervous time but the sales are giving me confidence.”Almost three hours after his arrival, Twell was back out in the sunshine, blinking and suitably bowled over. “It was great, really gripping and entertaining, brilliantly shot.” And happily for the cinema industry: “I’ll have to go back a second time to try to completely understand it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ddae729dae16443dda2057bea73d9946cd1a5e/0_1560_10328_6200/master/10328.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43004e2b2fcc65277fd9246b22305e25","title":"how to make spanakopita recipe felicity cloake masterclass filo spinach feta","story":"Enjoy the classic Greek spinach and cheese filo pie from the comfort of your own homeA pie for midsummer, when greens and cheese in crackly filo have the edge on steak and kidney wrapped in suet. Spanakopita is a Greek classic: equally good warm from the oven or cold the next day, vegetarian-friendly (so long as you use a feta made without animal rennet) and utterly delicious, it’s perfect picnic fare, even if you’re not going any farther than your own garden.1kg adult spinach, or frozen whole-leaf spinach, defrosted (see step 1)Salt1 red onion or leek4 spring onions2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for brushing300g vegetarian feta, crumbled25g dill, chopped20g mint leaves, chopped3 sprigs fresh oregano, leaves picked and chopped 50g bulgur wheat (optional)2 eggs, beatenZest of 1 unwaxed lemonNutmeg250g filo pastryOlive oil, for brushingThough Greek cuisine boasts a number of similar pies using a variety of greens, particularly the wild ones they’re so keen on, akopita traditionally contains spinach. That said, if you have chard, watercress, rocket or even young kale or nettles, substitute those instead (with the usual caveat about handling the nettles with gloves and care).If you stick with spinach, seek out the adult leaves for this dish baby spinach has a tendency to melt into an unsatisfactory green mush. It’s frustratingly hard to find in British supermarkets, but is usually available in greengrocers or markets – or in the freezer section, though make sure you get whole leaf, and defrost and squeeze it dry first.To prepare the fresh spinach, trim the bottom off the stalks, then roughly chop the leaves and finely chop the stems. Put in a colander with a generous sprinkle of salt, stand in a sink and massage the leaves with your hands until they wilt into a tractable mess (if you’re using frozen, defrosted stuff, just roughly chop it), then leave to drain.Meanwhile, peel and finely chop the red onion (or trim and finely chop the leek) and slice the spring onions. Heat the oil in a wide frying pan over a medium-low heat, and fry the onion (or leek) until softened but not browned. Take off the heat, immediately stir in the spring onions, then tip into a large bowl.Crumble the feta into the bowl. Roughly chop the herbs, discarding the woody stems from the mint, then add to the bowl with the bulgur wheat, if using it’s not a common ingredient in akopita, but it does help soak up the liquid from the spinach, and it gives the pie a more interesting texture. Rice will do much the same job.Wring out the spinach with your hands until no more water comes out (it should look thoroughly wilted by this point), then stir into the cheese bowl. Crack in the eggs and add the lemon zest, a glug of olive oil and a good grating of nutmeg, and mix again (again, hands are the best tool for this). Season lightly: feta is quite salty as it is.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6. Brush a 30cm x 25cm baking tin with olive oil, then line with half the filo, brushing each sheet with oil as you go (a spray is useful here, if you have one) take care not to press the sheets down too hard, otherwise they’ll compact. Leave any excess pastry hanging over the sides.Spoon in the filling, level out the top, then repeat the layering process with the remaining pastry to make a lid. Fold the overhang inwards to create an edible rim, drizzle with more oil and cut into the desired portion sizes. Bake for about 30-40 minutes, until golden. Leave to cool slightly, or completely, before serving.As Greeks tend to stick to a largely vegan diet during Lent, dairy-free versions of this dish abound: you could replace the feta with crumbled vegan cheese or tofu, but I think the pie is pretty delicious if you simply leave out the cheese and the eggs. Don’t be stingy with the olive oil, though, because you’ll need its richness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7574e106e91fa50feabfd5dabbee510b667b336/1066_0_4058_2435/master/4058.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0a516d32f5898de55e07be37255bdb9","title":"chelsea confirm signing of ben chilwell from leicester for 50m","story":"Chelsea have confirmed the signing of Ben Chilwell from Leicester for £50m, with the England defender moving to Stamford Bridge on a five-year contract as Frank Lampard continues to stengthen his squad for the new season.Chilwell, who was left out of England’s squad for next week’s Nations League matches due to injury, has long been targeted by the Chelsea manager and the 23-year-old was keen to play in the Champions League having just missed out on qualification with Leicester last season.

Cascarino swipes a volley towards the bottom right. It’s always going wide, but Endler doesn’t know that, and tips around for a corner. From the set piece, Bronze guides a header towards the top right, but Endler is able to claim.31 min: Dabritz tugs at Parris’s shirt. PSG are giving away quite a few free kicks at the moment. Parris isn’t happy. “Protect me! Protect me!” she shouts at the ref. Lyon getting irritated at the constant fouling.29 min: Paredes comes back on. Then Geyoro becomes the second Paris player to go into the book for a clumsy barge on Kumagai.28 min: Lyon apply some pressure as Paredes gets her knee wrapped. PSG hold out, but the champs are beginning to ask quite a few questions now.27 min: Paredes is off getting some treatment to a sore knee. 26 min: PSG take the sting out of the game by rolling it around the back awhile. Clever move, with Lyon beginning to impose their class.24 min: Cascarino has started brilliantly, and here she pulls back a ball she had no right to reach, from the byline to the right of goal. She was so fast, and her pullback so unexpected, that Parris was caught napping. PSG clear, with the champs beginning to apply some pressure.23 min: Geyoro is good to continue. And it seems she deflected Marozsan’s shot out for a corner, adding insult to injury. It’s hit long, and drops to Renard at the far post. She’s six yards out, but Bronze gets in her way and the chance to poke home is gone.22 min: Marozsan flashes a snapshot wide left from 25 yards. She accidentally kicks Geyoro on the follow-through, and so the physio comes on to deal with the fallout.21 min: Cascarino tears down the right again and swings a high cross into the box. Parris can’t get anywhere near it, though it’s looping dangerously close to goal anyway. Endler does very well to claim it at full stretch while backpedalling along her goalline.18 min: Nadim is booked for cynically hanging out a leg to stop a full-flight Karchaoui. The Lyon full-back was preparing to launch a counter from deep, forcing the PSG player to take one for her team. She doesn’t complain when the ref rushes across to flash yellow.16 min: Dabritz slips the overlapping Morroni into acres down the left. There are options in the middle, but she overhits the cross. Goal kick.14 min: A nice end-to-end feel now. Diani glides at the Lyon defence only to be put off by a wily tug from Marozsan Majri drives at PSG and wins a free kick that’s wasted. But the game is beginning to flow.12 min: So having said that, here she is, latching onto Marozsan’s right-wing cross and swiping for the bottom-left corner. It’s not the fiercest shot, but it does take a deflection, out for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece, but Parris, the competition’s all-time leading scorer, has made her first announcement of the evening.11 min: Paris are having the better of things at the moment. Lyon haven’t really got going yet, and they’re struggling to get much gametime in PSG’s half. Parris has barely touched the ball.9 min: The resulting free kick is no good, failing to beat the first woman, but PSG come straight back at Lyon, Bachmann tiptoeing down the left and nearly getting the better of Bronze. But not quite. Though she drops a shoulder to go past, she runs out of room and it’s a goal kick. This should be a good battle between two excellent players.8 min: Buchanan clatters into Geyoro out on the Paris left. A chance for the underdogs to load the box.6 min: An uncharacteristically poor pass in the midfield by Bachmann allows Lyon to flood forward. Marozsan slips a ball down the left for Karchaoui, who is in a lot of space, but wastes the opportunity by shanking harmlessly wide of goal from long distance. A rush of blood from the left-back.4 min: Cascarino goes on a long run down the right touchline, but eventually runs out of space. A very entertaining high-speed venture along the tightrope, though, and it had PSG on the back foot for a brief second.3 min: A little bit of space for Nadim out on the PSG right. She floats one into the mixer, but it’s an easy claim for Bouhaddi in the Lyon goal. Both teams just putting out feelers at this early stage.1 min: An early statement of intent by the ever-excellent Bronze, who outrageously nutmegs Diani while clearing her lines. Talk about calm defending.Before kick-off, the players take a knee. Black lives matter. And then PSG get the ball rolling.The teams are out!

Reigning champions Lyon take on Paris Saint-Germain at the San Mamés Stadium in Bilbao, for the right to face Wolfsburg in Sunday’s final.Lyon go into the match as favourites. They’re the reigning champions, having won the last four editions of this tournament, and a record six in total. They haven’t been beaten in this competition since November 2014, when they were shocked in the last 16 by ... Paris Saint-Germain. No prizes for spotting the narrative arc up above the streets and houses, flying high.It’s a tough ask for PSG to bring Lyon’s dominance to an end. This is a repeat of the 2017 final, which Lyon won on penalty kicks. Lyon stuffed PSG in the semis the season before, 8-0 on aggregate. And they’ve won all three of the domestic meetings this year, the latest victory at the French Cup final just a couple of weeks ago.But all is far from lost for PSG. As well as the aforementioned win in 2014, they tasted victory over Lyon in the 2018 French Cup final. More pertinently, they were excellent against Arsenal in last weekend’s quarter final - Kadidiatou Diani and Marie-Antoinette Katoto were magnificent - while Lyon, by their own lofty standards, were a little underwhelming in seeing off Bayern Munich. They’re also having to do without their star turn Ada Hegerberg, who scored a 16-minute hat-trick in last season’s final rout of Barcelona, but has been sidelined since January with damaged knee ligaments. Nikita Parris is a pretty nifty stand-in, mind.So will Lyon reach their ninth final? Or can PSG make it for the third time, in the hope of finally winning one? It’s going to be a heck of a ride finding out ... especially as these two don’t half like going to extra-time and penalties. It’s on!Kick off: 7pm BST, 8pm in the Basque Country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84149ebe731d615c1617c4ec0dc53557ac1cbe7e/0_166_1316_790/master/1316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=823057842ae831c9537d029a9be2d688","title":"baby names dua doubles in popularity in england and wales","story":"ONS figures show rise in popularity of name following success of singer Dua Lipa The name Dua has doubled in popularity in England and Wales since the singer Dua Lipa had her first number one single in 2017, official figures have revealed.Olivia and Amelia remained top of the charts for girls in 2019, while Oliver and George also remained the most popular choices for boys.Office for National Statistics (ONS) data released on Wednesday showed that 4,082 Olivias and 3,712 Amelias were born in 2019. The next most popular names for girls were Isla in third and Ava in fourth. There were 4,932 Olivers and 4,575 Georges, while Noah and Arthur made up the top four for boys.“Oliver and Olivia continued their reign as the top boys’ and girls’ names in 2019, but analysis shows choices in baby names can differ depending on the mother’s age,” said David Corps, of the ONS.“We found younger mothers opted for more modern girls’ names like Harper, which has seen a rise since the Beckhams named their daughter so in 2011, and shortened boys’ names like Freddie.“In contrast, older mothers chose more traditional names such as Jack and Charlotte.“Popular culture continues to influence the baby names landscape. Following Dua Lipa’s first UK number one single in 2017, the number of girls named Dua has doubled from 63 to 126 in 2019.”According to the data, Freya and Lily replaced Emily and Ella in the top 10 names for girls, while there were no new entries in the top 10 boys’ names. It is the first time Freya has been in the top 10 most popular girls’ names and also the first time Emily has not been in the top 10 since 1984, the ONS said. Fifth to eighth for girls were Mia, Isabella, Sophia and Grace.While there were nominally fewer Olivers and Olivias than in 2018, the drop was not enough to knock either from top spot.For girls, Hallie had the greatest rankings rise – up 21 places to 58th.

All of which, in the midst of a pandemic, sounds more appealing than everAimee Hartley, like most people, thought she knew how to breathe – she had, after all, been doing it all her life. She had also given it plenty of thought, having trained as a yoga teacher. But then she took a lesson with a breathing coach, who told her where she was going wrong. He pointed out she wasn’t taking the air into her lower lungs but was, she says, an “upper chest breather. He then taught me this conscious breathing and I felt my lower belly open, and I felt myself breathing a lot better after just one session. So I then became fascinated by how we breathe.”Watching her students in her yoga class, and observing people in everyday life, she started noticing that almost nobody breathes that well, by which she means in a way that makes your belly expand and your upper chest and back lift slightly, in a fluid motion. The exception, she says, is “babies, until they’re about three”. Then we forget how to breathe.There has been a huge rise in interest in “breathwork” in the last few years, in the western wellness world at least (spiritual practices such as Buddhism and Hinduism have long known about the benefits of breathing well). Hartley is a Transformational Breath coach, the method created by Judith Kravitz in the 70s. There are other methods, including Buteyko and holotropic, as well as the ancient pranayama, or breath control practice, in yoga. One of the stars of the breathwork world is Wim Hof, who advocates breathing exercises alongside cold therapy and meditation. Hartley offers group and private breathwork sessions, and published a book earlier this year, Breathe Well. Hers is just one of a number of books on breathing out this year, including Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art by the journalist James Nestor and Exhale by Richie Bostock, an Instagram-friendly coach who describes breathwork as “the next revolution in health and wellness”.These are exercises that promise to help us become better breathers, which, it is claimed by practitioners, can transform our physical and mental health by improving immune function, sleep, digestion and respiratory conditions, and reducing blood pressure and anxiety (or transporting you to a higher realm of consciousness, if that is your thing).There is little high-quality research to back up many of these claims, although it has become widely accepted that diaphragmatic breathing (engaging the large muscle between the chest and abdomen to take bigger, deeper lungfuls of air) can reduce feelings of stress and anxiety – and the NHS recommends this for stress relief. “If we are breathing into the diaphragm well, we can send messages to the body that we are safe,” says Hartley. Consciously slow and deep breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system – the “rest and digest” response that is opposite to the “fight or flight” sympathetic nervous system. Studies have shown that controlled breathing can reduce levels of the stress hormone cortisol in saliva, and another study shows that controlled breathing can alter the chemistry in the brain, affecting levels of another stress hormone, noradrenaline, which could enhance focus and keep brains healthier for longer. There has also been a rise in the use of breathing exercises to help people with asthma.The coronavirus pandemic may have accelerated the breath-training trend. Faced with a virus that affects the respiratory system, attacking the lungs of those severely affected and often leaving even those with mild symptoms with a breathlessness lasting months, there has been a renewed focus on breath. Should you be worried about someone standing close enough to breathe on you? Are you used to breathing through a face mask yet? Is suddenly being aware that it’s harder to take a deep breath a Covid symptom, or a sign of the anxiety many of us are experiencing at the moment? “I think people are becoming more aware of how they breathe and how that affects them,” says Hartley, who has been teaching clients over Zoom since lockdown began. “I’ve had clients that are now in recovery from Covid and they’ve said they have never become so aware of their breathing.”Breathwork has become fashionable, she thinks, “because it works”. The increased profile of mindfulness, with its focus on breathing, has been another reason, but even while we sit, eyes closed, following the guidance of an app, few of us know how to breathe well, she says.Watch a toddler breathe, she says, and they do it instinctively – their tummies swelling with each in-breath. Hartley believes it is when children begin school that bad habits start setting in that last a lifetime – they sit for long periods, move less, and start to experience emotional stressors that affect breathing (we are designed to take shallow breaths while under threat it is just that now we feel as if we are under threat all the time). “We go into this fight-or-flight mode and the muscles contract. We start holding our breath a lot more than we should do. It can be anything from feeling nervous in a classroom or something can be happening at home, and you start doing these micro-breath-holds, which morph into an adult dysfunctional breath pattern. It happens without us realising it.” She has created a programme for schools, School Breathe, which launches next week, after being piloted in three schools in east London, teaching children breathing exercises to improve concentration and reduce stress and anxiety.We are all surviving, Hartley points out – we take in 23,000 breaths in a day – but she says there is room for a better breath. “These micro-happenings throughout our lives sadly make this wonderful toddler breath turn into this crotchety teenage breath and on into adulthood.”It is hardly surprising, she says: “Modern life stops us breathing well.” Stress is associated with small, quick breaths which, in turn, makes us feel even more frazzled. Hartley has observed that people who live in cities, with the added problem of pollution, unconsciously take in shallower breaths. And even tight-fitting clothes, or snug bras, can affect your breathing, while “this mad desire to be skinny”, she says, has meant people holding their stomachs in – she says she has seen people reluctant to take a full breath because it gives a rounded-tummy shape.Spending time online, too, has affected our breath. “When we’re engaged in technology we’re doing these subconscious breath-holds a lot,” she says. It can happen when concentrating on writing an email, but also when mindlessly scrolling through social media. “And the things we see online can make us feel inadequate or anxious, so there’s an emotional factor that can affect breathing. I don’t know if anyone comes off social media feeling better.” There are also postural issues that can hamper our respiratory system, whether you are hunched over a laptop or, head down and neck bent, looking at your phone.The first step to improving your breathing is to become aware of it, says Hartley. You may notice you are holding your breath more than you realise, or taking shallow breaths. “Breathing is subconscious, as in it goes on 24 hours a day and most of those we don’t notice, but it’s the only system of the body that we have some alertness over and have some ability to change,” says Hartley. “Find out how you breathe first – place one hand on the lower belly, one hand on the upper chest, take a few breaths and notice which part of the body rises more.”There are dozens of exercises in Hartley’s book, as well as numerous tutorials online from breathwork coaches, books and apps, but as an easy one to try, she recommends extending the exhalation as a way to feel more relaxed. “Breathe in through the nose for four, hold the breath for two, and then breathe out for six, and then repeat that for a few rounds.” You can also practise on the move, ideal on your daily walk or commute, if you are back at work. “Breathe in for five steps while you’re walking, and out for five steps, always in and out through the nose.”To start getting familiar with breathing into the diaphragm, meanwhile, Hartley recommends sitting on the edge of a chair with legs hip-width apart, then leaning forward with your elbows on your knees and your chin resting in the palms of your hands. Take a deep “sniff-like” breath in through the nose. “You should feel your belly and lower back expand,” she says. And then breathe out slowly again through the nose, then repeat for a minute.And what if you want to lull yourself back to sleep? Try tensing all the muscles in your body as you breathe in through the nose, then releasing them as you exhale through the mouth, which you repeat a few times. Then create space between your teeth and, with your tongue placed on the hard palate, breathe in through the nose for a count of three, hold it for a count of four, then breathe out through the mouth, relaxing the tongue, while counting to five. Hartley advises repeating this for at least 10 rounds.Of all the wellness trends, one benefit appears to be that breathing – for all the coaches, books and apps out there – cannot be commercialised in quite the same way as sleep and eating. It is free, it can be done anywhere and the effects are instant. “Breathwork is brilliant for bringing us into the present moment,” says Hartley. “We spend a lot of time mentally elsewhere, and the breath can never be in the past or future. If we focus on our breath, we’re pulled back to the present moment so there’s no overworrying or overthinking. We can just be in the here and now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0b7e2a1fbea15ad4cc66f2794378f2a83cb1cc7/0_0_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1832043f06ba8f09c0bd25bd77e0e80","title":"men going their own way the toxic male separatist movement that is now mainstream","story":"The men of the MGTOW movement aim to live their lives with no female contact. The idea began on the fringes of the internet – so how has it made it all the way to the White House?‘There has been an awakening … changing the world … one man at a time.” These are the dramatic words that appear when you visit mgtow. In a video that looks a lot like an action-movie trailer, the words are soon followed by five more that appear to smash through the screen, smouldering fiery red: “Men … going … their … own way.”If you stumbled across this website and had never heard of “men going their own way” (MGTOW) before, you would probably assume this was a tiny, extreme movement. But you would be only half right.The views of MGTOW are indeed unorthodox, even within the sprawling web of groups, lifestyles and cults known as the “manosphere”, where women-haters mobilise against a supposed gynocratic conspiracy. While incels plot violent revenge on women, and pickup artists (PUAs) deploy predatory tactics to “game” women into having sex with them, the men of the MGTOW attempt to eschew relationships with women altogether. They are, literally, going their own way. Far, far away from any women. At all.Although some MGTOW maintain platonic relationships with women and others have one-night stands or visit sex workers, many prefer to abstain from sex, a process referred to as “going monk”. This is too much for some members of the wider manosphere. The blogger Matt Forney, notorious for posts such as “Why fat girls don’t deserve to be loved” and “The necessity of domestic violence”, wrote that “men going their own way is no way for men to go” and mocked MGTOW as “a cult for lonely virgins”.But this isn’t an obscure internet cul-de-sac mgtow alone has almost 33,000 members. Its forums (“for men only”) contain conversations on more than 50,000 topics, with more than 790,000 replies, which range from advice on orcing as cheaply as possible to lurid stories about women who have found particularly inventive ways to murder their husbands. The site also lists 25 video channels between them, these have more than 730,000 followers, and their videos have been viewed a total of 130m times.Over on YouTube, one of the best-known MGTOW vloggers, who goes by the name of Sandman, has racked up more 90m views for videos with titles ranging from “Smart men don’t get married” to “Criticise her and she will destroy your career”.The MGTOW philosophy is elaborately laid out on the mgtow website, which summarises it as “a statement of self-ownership, where the modern man preserves and protects his own sovereignty above all else”. Drawing on snippets of quotes and newspaper clippings, the site claims that MGTOW dates back to great men, including Schopenhauer, Beethoven, Galileo and “even Jesus Christ”.Women are essentially portrayed as parasites riding on the coattails of men, who have, throughout history, been responsible for “far greater miracles of science, discovery and human endeavour”. By shaking women off, it is explained, men will be free to pursue ever higher achievements.“I love this! I feel like I found the secret to the universe,” a user comments in mgtow’s testimonials section. Another writes that his city has become so “ultra-feminised” that things are “mind-blowingly bad for men here, especially straight white men”.Elsewhere, philosophy and opinion are mixed with a heavy dose of often deeply misogynistic advice, such as this from the FAQs section of a different MGTOW website: “My girlfriend is pregnant. What do I do?” “Whatever you do, do NOT invite her into the hot tub with champagne to ‘celebrate’. This can cause a miscarriage and she could lose the baby! Repeat: You should not under any circumstances do that … as quickly as possible.”It is impossible to know how seriously a comment like this is meant. But whether the original writer intended simply to shock or entertain, it is also impossible to know how it might be interpreted.MGTOW (pronounced “mig-tau” by adherents) are unlikely to meet in person, instead sharing their techniques, successes and failures online. Throughout the manosphere, it is common to see members expressing paranoia about “normies” who could be out to expose them, often leading to forum users accusing each other of being moles or spies. Nowhere is this fear more prevalent than among MGTOW, with any suggestion of meeting in real life usually receiving a swift and scornful rebuttal.Once you have “taken the red pill” (ie, opened your eyes to the “reality” that, as a man, the whole world is stacked against you) there are four main levels of MGTOW, according to many websites. Level one involves rejecting long-term relationships, while level two extends this to short-term relationships. Level three requires economic disengagement (reducing taxation as far as possible, in order to avoid paying towards the support of other groups, from “elite alphas” to “single mothers”). As one MGTOW manifesto puts it, as well as fighting to “instil masculinity in men”, MGTOW must “work toward limited government”.Level four is described as “social rejection”. “The MGTOW drops out of society altogether,” says the MGTOW blogger the Observer Watches. “For all intents and purposes, he does not exist. A urbanite might keep to his own apartment, while someone further out may simply head into the wilderness and go off-grid.”Those who achieve this ultimate isolation are known as “ghosts” and treated as legends within the community. But most MGTOW seem happy hovering somewhere around level two. Discussions tend to centre on classic manosphere complaints such as the evils of women and misandry (hatred of men). Most of all, they focus on the dangers of interacting with women.“There is a lot of risk,” David Sherratt, an 18-year-old Cardiff University student and then dedicated member of the MGTOW community, noted in 2015. “We do not know how many false accusations there are. They could be the majority or they could be the minority.” The implication was that there are so many women ready to lie about rape that any contact with them is simply too dangerous to risk. In reality, a man in the UK is 230 times more likely to be raped himself than falsely accused of rape.In this, MGTOW resemble men’s rights activists (MRAs) more than incels or PUAs. Both groups believe that women pose an immediate threat to all men. MRAs believe that women are so unfaithful and untruthful that they often force men to raise other men’s children, thus financially “cuckolding” them. MGTOW believe that women are extremely likely to make false accusations of sexual or domestic violence, in order to damage men socially, steal their money or even have them jailed.Sherratt also went on to cite a list of concerns that would resonate particularly closely with MRAs, including: “Men are supposed to pay for dates and bow down to women … anything less than worship is hate” and: “When it comes to marriage, the system is so stacked against men, it does not make sense.” MGTOW and MRAs alike see orce as deeply one-sided, allowing women to rob innocent men of money, property and, in some cases, children.Unable to stop thinking about Sherratt, I tracked him down to ask about his experience of becoming involved in the community. Now 22, Sherratt is an engineering apprentice and says he has left MGTOW and other manosphere groups behind. At first, he says, they were “legitimately fun … I had lots of friends, which was new to me, lots of fans and positive reinforcement. As we started to grow and build, it honestly felt like we were eventually going to start making some positive change. It wasn’t just a community, but a new, growing movement that I got into ‘before it was cool’, so, in a way, I felt like I was part of something progressive.”Sherratt could not, however, claim to be a pioneer. It is generally accepted within the MGTOW community that the movement was started in the mid-00s by two men going by the pseudonyms Solaris (an Australian) and Ragnar (a Scandinavian, who describes himself as “an old guy” and a former pilot), both of whom had been previously active in what they described as the “online men’s movement”. “A sense of alienation is where this whole thing starts,” Solaris claimed in a 2012 YouTube interview. “You realise, simply because you’re a man, that you are considered a legitimate target for being the butt of jokes or being considered a class enemy.”As with many areas of the manosphere, it is difficult to know where most users of MGTOW forums and communities are based, though the majority communicate in English, and comments and user names suggest that the US, Canada and the UK are common locations. An mgtow post entitled Hello From the UK draws enthusiastic replies from “fellow Brits”, who claim to be writing from areas including the Midlands, Sussex and Salford. They revel in their shared ideology as much as their shared location, heartily agreeing with the participant’s opening salvo: “Fucking women, they are all snakes with tits.”There is also a website called British MGTOW, which rails against what it describes as the “Nazi-like behaviour” of the British state in silencing and censoring non-PC views, claiming: “The UK is sick and it needs healing. The laws are in desperate need of a revamp but all I see around me are docile willing men led to the slaughter.”It is, one imagines, very difficult for a man to release himself completely from the toxic impact of women while entangled within a community feverishly obsessed with, well, women. This was apparent even to the teenage Sherratt, who says: “I understood the scepticism of marriage and stuff, but, for men who were talking about trying to live lives that didn’t centre around women, they were talking about them an awful lot.” When he tried to voice his disagreements with various elements of MGTOW ideology, he was accused of being “mind-controlled by a girl”. Soon afterwards, he left the community, having met a girl who (rather unsurprisingly) shared his criticisms. “So I guess the joke’s on them,” he muses.It is easy to write off MGTOW as a weird group of goofy celibates. Yet it has, in some ways, quietly penetrated mainstream culture more successfully than any other segment of the manosphere.In the immediate wake of the #MeToo movement, which saw millions of women worldwide standing up to sexual harassment and assault by sharing their own stories, there was a swift and severe backlash. Critics claimed that the movement was a pitchfork mob: a “witch-hunt” designed to topple men from their jobs and lives, without so much as an attempt at due process. Some commentators settled for hounding women who had dared to share their stories, or denigrating the movement as a whole. But gradually another response emerged, borrowing its ideology directly from MGTOW: avoiding women at all costs.It started with rumours: women reporting that men in their offices had suddenly started declining meetings with them or were insisting on leaving the door open. A human resources consultant reported executives telling her that they would no longer get into an elevator alone with a woman. Suddenly, it began to snowball – story after story of men abruptly cancelling business lunches or avoiding women they had previously mentored.In the same way that the MGTOW movement turns the structural oppression of women on its head, claiming men are the true victims of gender bias, this spate of mainstream examples sought to cast men as the real victims of the #MeToo movement. Men, it argued, had little choice but to protect themselves from the all-powerful cabal of rampaging, vindictive women making false accusations. Even if the solution was as extreme as total isolation.An orthopaedic surgeon in Chicago told the New York Times that he had ceased ever to be alone with female colleagues, saying: ‘I’m very cautious about it because my livelihood is on the line … If someone in your hospital says you had inappropriate contact with this woman, you get suspended for an investigation, and your life is over. Does that ever leave you?” His apparent implication that such accusations are simply random, based on no wrongdoing whatsoever, went unchallenged in the piece.The woman-shunning has even penetrated as far as the White House, where the vice-president, Mike Pence, spawned what is now known as the Pence Rule after he remarked that he would never eat a meal alone with a woman who is not his wife.Reporting on such an idea might have once been seen as inflammatory or biased, requiring careful and robust presentation of opposing arguments. But, as soon as it was attached to Pence, it became respectable fodder for widespread coverage. “THINK,” tweeted Sebastian Gorka, a former deputy assistant to Donald Trump. “If Weinstein had obeyed @VP Pence’s rules for meeting with the opposite sex, none of those poor women would ever have been abused.” Of course, if Weinstein hadn’t been an abusive predator, the same outcome could have been achieved, too. Just a thought.Before long, a book had been published to spread the word. As the Amazon listing for The Pence Principle, by Randall Bentwick, puts it: “Every man in America could stand to learn a lesson or two from our vice-president. Be smart … Defend yourself, your career, your family and your life from the false accusations of women today and into the future.”This is an edited extract from Men Who Hate Women by Laura Bates, published by Simon \u0026amp Schuster on 3 September.

An astonishingly productive composer, Bach perfected all the existing musical forms of the baroque period and took the use of harmony to a new level, setting out parameters that most of the western musical tradition has been working within ever since.If you know only one piece of organ music, chances are it’s Bach’s Toccata and Fugue in D minor, the soundtrack to any number of shock-horror moments on film Disney used Leopold Stokowski’s grandiose orchestral version in Fantasia. Thousands of couples have signed their wedding registers to the sound of Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring. And if you are old enough to remember when cigars were still advertised on primetime TV then you’ll know that happiness comes with the second movement of Bach’s Orchestral Suite No 3, better known now as the Air on the G String.Bach was born in 1685 in Eisenach, a small town in Thuringia in what is now Germany, into a dynasty of musicians (several of his children, notably Carl Philipp Emanuel and Johann Christian, became renowned composers themselves). His mother died when he was nine, and his father less than a year later, leaving the orphaned Bach to be brought up by his oldest brother. His career began aged 18 in Weimar, and progressed as he moved between towns working as a court musician or, more often, an organist, a job that typically included composing choral cantatas and other music for church services – the Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor, one of his best-known organ works, dates from his early days as an organist in Arnstadt. Life for the previous generation of composers had been much the same. These included Dietrich Buxtehude, of whom Bach thought so highly that he took time off from his Arnstadt post to travel more than 260 miles to Lübeck – on foot, it is claimed – to hear him play in doing so he stretched four weeks’ leave to four months, which led to one of the disputes with employers that would be a recurring feature of his career.Bach spent five years in Cöthen in the household of Prince Leopold, a Calvinist who had no use for elaborate devotional works, and it was here that his instrumental music blossomed. In the six Brandenburg Concertos, he put groups of instruments rather than single players in the spotlight, in the fashionable Italian concerto grosso style. The six Cello Suites and the Six Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin are nominally sets of dances, though they were probably never intended to be actually danced to likewise the Orchestral Suites, and the French Suites for keyboard. It was in Cöthen that Bach compiled the first volume of The Well-Tempered Clavier (“tempered” meaning tuned), a collection of preludes and fugues for keyboard, in each of the 24 major and minor keys – this gives a hint of his lifelong love of completeness, precision and mathematical symbolism. The strictures and challenges of fugue – in which repetitions and transformations of a theme must be slotted together like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle – were conquered by Bach like no other composer before or since.It was his next and final move, to the relatively cosmopolitan city of Leipzig, that would allow him to fulfil his extraordinary ambitions regarding church music. As head of music at St Thomas’s church, he was required to provide music for services on each Sunday and feast day of the year Bach set out to compose, by himself, a “well-regulated” body of new music that would cover several years. Most of his nearly 200 surviving cantatas are the result of this extraordinary period of creativity, as well as his Magnificat, many of the organ works (including chorale preludes such as Wachet Auf and Jesu Joy), his Christmas Oratorio and the two great gospel settings for Good Friday: the St John and St Matthew Passions. The last mentioned are, in effect, sung passion plays, the storytelling interspersed with reflective arias and congregational hymns along with the B Minor Mass (which Bach completed the year before his death) they arguably represent the pinnacle of Bach’s art – although lovers of keyboard music might also point to the Goldberg Variations. Bach died in 1750, leaving incomplete an ambitious final collection, The Art of Fugue.What did those Leipzig congregations think of the musical riches lavished upon them? For that matter, what did Bach think? We don’t know. There are very few sources to go on. Few of Bach’s letters survive, and those that do are mostly to his employers, lobbying for better conditions or musical resources. He was reckoned to be the greatest organist of his day, but to become a household name he would have had to have composed for an opera house, and – unlike, say, George Frideric Handel, born in the same year – he wasn’t interested.He found genuine consolation in both music and his unswerving Lutheran faith, which had been twin pillars of his upbringing: much of the teaching in Lutheran schools was done through music and singing, and the standard Lutheran hymns were so well known that the congregations in the Passion services would have had no trouble singing along. But we would be wrong to think of Bach only in a devoutly religious context his “other” job in Leipzig, as director of a group called the Collegium Musicum, saw him leading dozens of concerts each year in one of the city’s increasingly fashionable coffee houses. His Vivaldi-inspired concertos for solo violin, and the matchless Double Concerto, may have been composed for the Collegium Musicum the tongue-in-cheek Coffee Cantata certainly was.Because for countless musicians, whatever their omega, Bach is their alpha. He, more than any other composer, remains a shared point of reference. As Beethoven studied Bach, so do today’s music students, learning the rules of harmony from his hymn settings, and the art of counterpoint – how to interweave two or more melodies together – from his fugues. It’s almost as if Bach himself made and codified those rules, if it weren’t for how often he breaks them in his own music, and to what wonderful effect.Fashions change, but Bach’s music always works. His music has been at the vanguard of the period-instrument performance movement, and has reaped the rewards in an increasing number of dynamically charged recordings – but that hasn’t invalidated anyone else’s ownership. The 1960s and 70s saw a vogue for performing Bach as jazz, thanks to Jacques Loussier and the Swingle Singers. The Goldberg Variations can be just as glorious on accordion or harp or mandolin as on piano or harpsichord. This is music that is capable of endless renewal. It’s also the music that was chosen to introduce the human race to extra-terrestrials: Bach has three tracks on the Voyager space probe’s Golden Record, more than any other composer or group.But none of that explains the singularity of Bach, and the connection he makes with so many music-lovers. The composer György Kurtág, who often references Bach in his work, expressed it thus when asked if he believed in God. “Consciously, I am certainly an atheist, but I do not say it out loud, because if I look at Bach, I cannot be an atheist. Then I have to accept the way he believed.” What is it that connects on such a strong, subconscious level? In the instrumental works, it’s perhaps their sense of balance, of mathematical completeness – this can make the music seem in some way elemental. But the devotional music is where we get a sense of Bach’s humanity and of his music’s capacity for empathy and consolation. In the St Matthew Passion, for example, it’s striking that the most moving sequence is not for Jesus – however tenderly Bach draws him, with a “halo” of glowing strings around his words – but for Peter. His bitter grief at having betrayed his friend finds expression in the alto aria Erbarme dich and, as we listen, it’s our own shortcomings as much as Peter’s that seem to be offered up for forgiveness. At times like these, Bach doesn’t judge, doesn’t moralise he simply sits with us until we have found peace."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17bd92145c567187de462e289f05ac76fc51ed12/0_0_4731_3154/master/4731.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cf7da8736b4d612ac4ea5cc0b39bb9c 700w","title":"a post pandemic guide for retailers think of your customers as your biggest fans","story":"Lockdown has shown us that people will support the brands they want to succeed – a business expert’s advice to store ownersThe retail sector has been in flux for some time and, post coronavirus, there’s more uncertainty to come.“There is a lot of talk about ‘returning to normal’ or of the ‘new normal’, but prior to the pandemic the only normal was that everything was changing,” says business consultant Neil Gibb. The pandemic has simply accelerated that transformation, he said ahead of a British Retail Consortium webinar on the impact of Covid-19.Even an industry that has weathered its fair share of storms has never seen an event of this size and significance, and it’s becoming clear that the rules of engagement are changing. As retailers navigate uncharted waters, these are the rules that matter right now:Put safety firstAbove all, responsible businesses have to prioritise safety, both for staff and customers. According to Kyle Monk, head of retail insights and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, retailers are working hard on both implementing safety measures and communicating them clearly. Luckily, technology is on our side when it comes to designing systems that put safety first, but not at the expense of the customer experience. He cites a technology company that has shop assistants available by video screen in-store. The remote shop assistants can engage with you in a similar way in which they would normally.While it may seem at first that the new retail environment will not make the most fun of shopping experiences, with creativity, innovation and by utilising tech, companies can get the balance right.Be collaborative“The scale of the pandemic and the speed with which we’ve had to adopt a new way of living has left many of us feeling uncertain – especially retailers,” says Andrew Lawson, senior vice-president EMEA for Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. The good news, however, is that a sense of optimism is emerging as businesses deal successfully with unstable operating conditions. “We’ve seen incredible stories of resilience coming out of the pandemic, as retailers and their suppliers band together to maintain the flow of goods,” says Lawson.This collaborative spirit will be important for the industry if it is to retain momentum, share best practice and agree about what support may be needed from the government. “It’s kind of unprecedented,” says Monk. “I don’t think, to be honest, any other industry is coordinating in the way that retail is at the moment.”PrioritiseWhile some retailers have launched e-commerce platforms in record time – one European chain that had around 1,000 stores but no e-commerce platform, managed to launch one in 13 weeks – Lawson suggests that incremental digital transformation might be the better way forward. Zendesk is finding that many of its customers are reluctant to invest time and money in total digital transformation when there is still so much uncertainty. “The priority is to identify solutions that can deliver returns on investment quickly,” he says. “For example, by looking at an omnichannel approach, you can bring all the information you have on a customer together in one place. This will provide your marketing and sales teams with invaluable insights.”Support your staffWe may never return to business as usual but, according to Lawson, companies can move forward by supporting and listening to feedback from staff. He also emphasises the connection between a happy and valued workforce, and the ability to be agile, scalable and resilient. “By helping employees adapt to new systems and processes through training and regular communication, and by really listening to feedback, the new styles and systems that we work under really can work for everyone,” he says.Appeal to your fansThere has never been a better time for companies to revisit their core purpose – building a trusted and valued brand. Research from Zendesk shows that customers have been more patient during the pandemic. While the volume of service requests and wait times have gone up, customer satisfaction remains fairly steady, indicating brand loyalty. Customers will support the brands that they want to succeed, says Monk.And Gibb believes successful retailers won’t have customers going forward, they’ll have loyal fans – people who care deeply about what that brand really stands for. For decision-makers in the retail business, who feel that the ground is constantly shifting beneath them, focusing on purpose could provide a much needed stable foundation.Things are changing fast.

Now everyone faces a new issue: how to return to some semblance of business normality.“The world of work – particularly how we think about work and how we think about where we work, has fundamentally shifted,” says coach and productivity expert Karen Eyre-White. “A lot of businesses have been in crisis mode. What we’re seeing now is them having to get back to a new normal with strategy, boundaries and structure in place.”Some things haven’t changed. As before, high productivity will be a priority – particularly given the gloomy economic predictions. Achieving it depends on motivation, training and technology, time management and support from others. But how can businesses make sure they have these essentials in place as we move out of lockdown and get back to work?Have clarity of purposeWith so much uncertainty around, business leaders need to reassure staff by projecting confidence and clarity wherever possible. “Try to be certain about as much as you can,” says Eyre-White, whether that involves scheduling regular catch-up meetings, or deciding the office won’t reopen until next year. Managers can boost their own productivity and that of their team by being clear about their priorities for any given day or week, and encouraging others to do the same.Aligning those priorities with the company’s objectives will keep even a remote team moving in the right direction, says Chris Bailey, author of Hyperfocus: How to Work Less to Achieve More. “The greatest challenge that businesses face in normal times is orienting what everybody’s working on toward what the purpose of the business is … and that’s still the case,” he says. “The more intentional we are about how we work and what we work on, the more productive we become.”Where priorities have changed, it’s important to communicate that effectively to staff, says Sarah Manning, senior HR director at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “I can’t imagine many organisations didn’t have to pivot in some way in lockdown. Leaders need to be really clear now about what the expectation of their teams are going to be and put in measures to help people adapt.”Empower staff to find their way of workingProductivity can be difficult to measure, but focusing on the tasks achieved rather than the hours someone is at their desk can boost efficiency. Despite reports that lockdown led to an upsurge in demand for workforce surveillance tools, Eyre-White says that such an approach is unlikely to be effective. “Inidually, everyone needs to do different things in order to be productive,” she adds. “I just do not see how a surveillance system is compatible with that.”Instead, businesses should be encouraging staff to find what works for them – some people might be most productive if they go for a walk in the morning, others might take short breaks after 45 minutes of focused work, while some team members might need to work around a young family at home.Projecting empathy for the circumstances many of us find ourselves in is important, says Manning. Particularly at present. “Life is crazy right now. I think employers need to acknowledge that.”Promote good communicationWhen it comes to managing virtual teams, good communication is key to ensuring staff feel supported and informed. “Once a company has made a decision, communicate it clearly,” says Manning. “You need to be careful not to go out with half a message and cause a whole lot of anxiety for people.”Keeping communication channels open can promote a culture of collaboration.Apps such as Zoom, Slack, other digital tools and internal help desks can help ensure “people still feel engaged, connected and therefore invested”, says Manning. Zendesk, for example, has held remote quizzes, yoga classes and Friday night drinks during lockdown. There are other examples of companies holding digital book clubs, remote murder mystery games, and scavenger hunts.“Anything you can do as a manager to foster meaningful connections between employees will go a long way,” Bailey says.It’s OK to have down timeStaff may be working from home, but it’s important not to encourage an “always on” culture that blurs the boundaries between work life and home life, Eyre-White says. “There’s this idea of e-presenteeism and needing to be seen,” she adds. “Staff can’t be seen in the office so they may feel they need to be replying to their emails or messages instantly. And that’s not how you get productive work done. You need time away from those things. Businesses need to be clear that it’s OK.”One way to set the tone is to offer training to managers to help them adapt to working with, and supporting, remote teams. Simple measures can set an example, such as resisting the temptation to email outside work hours, and blocking out time for breaks on a calendar that the team has access to.No one should feel guilty about taking a break from work, says Bailey. “Focusing on things all day long is one of the worst things we can do because our mind just needs a chance to wander. Mind the guilt that you experience around relaxation and know that it’s a phenomenon most of us experience.”Embrace flexibilityAlongside the difficulties of the past few months, for many firms there have also been opportunities for lasting change.“If going remote didn’t kill a business, companies are going to have to decide their answer when employees ask: ‘Can I work from home?’” Manning says. “There are huge benefits from a cost perspective … and I do think companies can potentially attract more candidates and more ersity.”Staying flexible – and that might mean some staff work remotely in the long term – will help foster an inclusive, productive culture that has broader benefits.“This has definitely opened our eyes up to those different possibilities,” Manning adds. “We are going to have a much more flexible approach to where people can work and how they work.”Things are changing fast.

A huge drop in sales during March seemed to sound the death knell for at least some sectors of the industry. Online sales, on the other hand, have rocketed and new approaches are emerging among those retailers that are learning to be agile.“Covid-19 has really accelerated a bunch of inevitables. A lot of things are just happening a lot faster,” says Steve Hewett, global vice president for retail customer experience at the tech and consultancy firm Capgemini.For many companies, online is exploding. “This was already happening,” says Hewett. “But some companies are achieving the sort of online growth in weeks that they expected in three or four years.”This has implications for how companies do business, and it’s likely to be crucial to be able to deliver a hybrid onlineoffline experience to the post-Covid-19 customer. Here are five trends currently reshaping the retail sector:Brands are getting chattierIt seems that customers engaged with brands more during lockdown. “For years, buying something meant going to a physical place, seeing the branding in the store and understanding who that brand is,” says Adrian McDermott, president of products at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “We need to establish the digital equivalents of finding, meeting and having those conversations.”Prices could remain “sticky”Rajesh Bhargave, a consumer behaviour expert, suggests that retailers need to be wary of changing their prices – whether up or down. “Consumers tend to remember what they paid previously and would view price increases as unjust in poor economic conditions.”Dropping prices is not always the answer either. Many consumers will have taken a financial hit and their wallets will be closed for concessionary spending. A knee-jerk reaction might be to cut prices to bring back that demand but, says Bhargave, associate professor of marketing at Imperial College Business School in London, this could have negative long-term effects and erode pricing power: “If you’ve been paying £10 for a meal and suddenly that’s £8 you start to wonder about the quality of the meal.”Brands have to add valueInstead of dropping prices, brands are likely to start looking at different ways to add value, says Bhargave. “If people want to dine at restaurants, they might want a more private and safe experience,” he says. “So how can you start offering a different service that charges a higher price and offers better value?”Video calling is another area that business is only starting to explore. “With so much taking place on Zoom, is there a higher-end service you can provide in this area?” Selfridges, for example, is offering online beauty and styling appointments, with products then delivered to customers at home.This is part of a move towards getting more revenue from fewer people, and appointments for in-store shopping also fall into this category. “It’s all part of offering a more customised, high-end experience,” says Bhargave.To bring the joy back into shopping, some stores are putting their energies into their window displays to encourage browsing and others are providing queue entertainment.The need for a new kind of agilityThings may never be the same. “We’ve almost got to hit the reset button,” says Hewett. “People are returning to school and the office and there’s no playbook on what the wants and needs are.” Moreover, whatever they are could change dramatically again. Hewett adds: “There’s an organisational need for agility that wasn’t there before, as brands aren’t able to be as tactical as they would like.”Things are changing fast. But you can be faster.

Despite government support, having to close their doors for months had a crippling effect on many and forced them to take action to keep afloat.For Steve Sanderson, founder of the independent menswear retailer Oi Polloi, lockdown pressed fast forward on an already tough situation for small businesses. The company’s store in Manchester has always been at its heart, but it also has a strong online and social presence. “Bricks and mortar operations are really difficult,” he says. “What’s going on at the moment is sort of a super fast wormhole journey into the future.”Sanderson says that things are going to be particularly tough for fashion stores, with an inevitable drop in footfall, plus the issues of being Covid-19-secure, such as being unable to let customers try on clothes unless the items are quarantined or cleaned afterwards. “If people can’t try things on, why would they come in to a clothes shop?” he asks.There are, though, some rays of hope. “We have a good connection with customers through our bricks and mortar business, and certain people will always like that. But we can’t afford to just be open – we have to find a way of making it work.“We’ll have to adapt and become something else, something people can’t get from anywhere else. I like the idea of click and collect because you can do something quite interesting with that. You could then also narrow down the time the store itself is open.”For Michelle Drew, co-founder of Established 25 Atelier, which sells fashion and home accessories, the coronavirus crisis forced her to reassess her ambitions. Before lockdown, Drew, who started in 2017 making scarves and bags for friends and family, was selling at a quarterly design market in Greenwich and had a monthly stall at Spitalfields market. When Covid-19 brought things grinding to a halt, her first thought was that she needed to get her website up and running, and really engage online. “I didn’t have a choice,” she says.Since then, Drew has joined online workshops and used the time to rethink her plans. “Previously, I thought I’d love to collaborate with other designers and have a premises. I’m now wondering if that’s the way forward, because so much has changed and I’m not sure things will ever be the same.”While Drew plans to return to physical selling at some point, she sees her business relying more on online trading. “It’s still a precarious situation. I definitely will return to the markets because I enjoy the contact, but I’m looking at other ways to move the business forward.”Bigger retailers, too, have faced challenges, for all their greater resources. Some have come through with flying colours, though, particularly if they had the right technology to hand.For Tesco, the coronavirus crisis brought an unprecedented surge in demand, but the company was well placed to react quickly. It already had emergency plans in place thanks to a “doomsday” management exercise four years ago. It had also embraced remote working, and had the technology to handle communication with 460,000 staff, suppliers, people services and security operations. These systems allowed the company to double its capacity for delivery and click and collect in just six weeks. Improvements to the computer algorithms used to drive picking technology – plus the army of pickers hired to cope with the increased demand – mean that whatever the future brings, the chain appears to have the flexibility to deal with it.Similarly, the online flower delivery company Bloom \u0026amp Wild proved its resilience. For its founder Aron Gelbard, protecting jobs by staying open was important, as was providing people with a way of showing they care for the loved ones they couldn’t see in lockdown.With its tailored CRM system, which manages queries from a range of channels, Bloom \u0026amp Wild now employs more than 25 customer service agents who manage between 3,000 and 3,500 inquiries every week – rising dramatically during peak times such as Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day and, undoubtedly, lockdown.The company uses Zendesk to manage its customer relationships, allowing agents to deal with inquiries across Twitter, email, phone, online chat, Facebook Messenger and SMS. Alongside this, analytics help the company forecast customer demand and plan for peaks.As a business that exists purely in the virtual world, it’s an example to retailers everywhere of what can be achieved by clever use of technology.Things are changing fast.

The Tower of London reports similar numbers, with around 2,500 visitors “on a good day” versus 12-15,000 previously.He believes one way to address the reluctance to visit city centres is to publicise the R rate in cities in the same way the pollen rates are publicised. “London, for example, has one of the lowest R rates in the country. We have suggested this to the mayor’s office and the department for digital, culture, media and sport – that it would help people to make informed decisions.”Tourism businesses hope the August bank holiday will bring a late summer boost to spending, but encouraging people to holiday beyond the end of the summer holidays will be vital to make up for income loss. “We are going to need flocks of visitors through autumn and the winter to support businesses to be able to trade profitably,” said Patricia Yates, director strategy and communications for Visit Britain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c33dbc0de30deb5cb63bc920b773e2ac2fdccee/0_221_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=03623d26b19904783b0749811dd27593","title":"karate kid ralph macchio im at peace with the choices i made cobra kai","story":"He crane-kicked his way into movie history as Daniel LaRusso in the 80s film, but chose to put family before fame. Now he’s back in his most famous role in a comedy sequel It is hard to convey just how stratospherically famous Macchio, now 58, became when The Karate Kid – in which he played plucky lower middle-class teen Daniel LaRusso, crane-kicking the snotty rich kids – came out in 1984. Back in the 80s, a young person could become a huge star with just one movie and, to a large extent, those movies still define those actors: Tom Cruise had Risky Business, Matthew Broderick had Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, Michael J Fox had Back to the Future and Macchio had The Karate Kid.Nostalgia for those films and the deceptively basic (but actually tenaciously deep) joys they brought means 80s films are, once again, having a comeback, with the third Bill \u0026amp Ted film getting released next month in the UK, a fifth Indiana Jones apparently creaking out in 2022, and the official sequel to Dirty Dancing now in the works. But it’s The Karate Kid – seemingly the most simple of 80s blockbusters – that has unexpectedly had the most satisfying afterlife with Cobra Kai, the ludicrously enjoyable series that started on YouTube and has just been bought by Netflix.Cobra Kai is the ultimate fan fic, but in the best possible way. Created by Karate Kid superfans Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, it imagines what happened to Daniel and his nemesis Johnny (William Zabka) 34 years on from the famous tournament, with Daniel now a successful car salesman and Johnny a barely functioning alcoholic, until he decides to reopen a certain karate school. But what could have been pure self-indulgence becomes surprisingly rich and textured, as Heald, Hurwitz and Schlossberg take seemingly minor elements from the original film (most notably the social class differences between Daniel and Johnny, but also the cars, the houses and the great fan debate about whether Daniel cheated in the tournament) and blow them up into whole episodes that go to far deeper places than the movies touched upon.“Jon, Josh and Hayden know way more about the films than I ever did,” marvels Macchio. “We’ll be shooting a scene and they’ll say: ‘Remember that time you lifted your left arm? The way you pointed that finger was definitive to my childhood!’ I’m like: ‘Dude, I was just saying a line!’ Oh, it’s really wonderful.”One of the many joys of Cobra Kai is how many of the original cast members appear in it. As well as Macchio and Zabka there’s Martin Kove, who played the bullying Cobra Kai teacher Kreese, and Randee Heller, AKA Mrs LaRusso, Daniel’s mother. There is even a hint at the end of the second series that Elisabeth Shue, who played Daniel’s girlfriend Ali, might make a comeback. But there is one gaping absence and that is Mr Miyagi, Daniel’s sensei, played by the wonderful Pat Morita, who died in 2005.“That’s been tough,” says Macchio, who spoke at Morita’s funeral. “There’s a montage scene in series two in which I’m teaching a younger kid, just as Miyagi taught LaRusso, and that brought a real rush of emotion for me. Every time we shoot I hearken back to those early days of rehearsal with Pat.” And yet, as beloved as Mr Miyagi was as a character, even getting an Oscar nomination for his performance, some Asian Americans have since said that they felt stereotyped by him, getting teased about his exaggerated accent (which Morita put on for the part) and constantly fending “wax on, wax off” references. Was Morita aware of the criticisms?Macchio made three Karate Kid films with Morita, with diminishing returns – the original, though, remains a stone-cold classic – and there was a fourth with Hilary Swank and Morita. Will Smith attempted to revive the franchise in 2010, now set in China, with his son Jaden and Jackie Chan as the mentor. It had, shall we say, a mixed reception. Macchio, famously one of the nicest people ever to appear on screen, is too kind to trash it, saying only “It enhanced the legacy of the original,” and he allows himself to point out: “Also, there’s no such thing as karate in China, so it should have been called The Kung Fu Kid.”While pretty much every other successful young actor in the 80s went through some kind of emotional off-screen ordeal, Macchio remained straight and stable, mainly living with his parents on Long Island and marrying his childhood sweetheart, Phyllis, when he was 26. They are still together and have two children. Macchio’s steadiness – which he puts down to his “upbringing and natural sensibilities” – is so renowned that Funny or Die made a very amusing film in which the actor tries to behave badly to beef up his career. It’s a good joke, but there is some truth to it, Macchio admits, because he always put personal stability before fame.Macchio has always been remarkably good-natured about being so associated with Karate Kid, even though he has had a perfectly healthy career as a jobbing actor beyond it. His first big break was in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Outsiders, alongside Tom Cruise, Rob Lowe, Matt Dillon and Emilio Estevez, and Lowe recounts in his memoir how Macchio was the on-set joker.“I always try to go for the joke, maybe because I’ve always been the smallest guy or the youngest-looking guy, so that was my defence,” he says. (Incredibly, despite looking about 13, Macchio was 22 in Karate Kid.) His other best-known role was in My Cousin Vinny, and Macchio compares the famous chemistry between Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei with what he had with Morita. More recently, there have been steady TV roles in Ugly Betty and The Deuce.But Karate Kid retains a special place in his heart, so much so that he named his son, Daniel, after his character in the film. “There was a chunk of time when my son was like: ‘Did you have to?’ But now he’s proud of it. Unlike Ralph, Daniel is a classic, it never goes out of style, you know?”Cobra Kai seasons one and two are available on Netflix on Friday, with season three due later this year"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b56ea8f639de748f35ba7c938154b4023e02dd3/0_298_3060_1836/master/3060.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=c79b937942dcdba7b391445197b60b3a","title":"iowa derecho storm photos farmers","story":"The hurricane-like storm, called a derecho, tore through Iowa this month, damaging buildings and threatening the harvest A rare inland storm known as a derecho passed through the state of Iowa on 10 August, leaving widespread damage in its wake.Winds reaching 140 miles an hour demolished many parts of the city of Cedar Rapids. But it’s the state’s farmland where the long-term impact is expected to be felt most.Robert Miller, 88, and his son Bruce have a farm in Norway, Iowa, which was badly hit by the derecho.“I’m no scientist, but global warming is here. This is it,” said Bruce.Robert’s other son, Van, drove up from Kansas City earlier in the week to help with the clean up process. Because the farm’s silo is so badly damaged, they have no choice but tear it down.Millions of dollars in damage had been dealt not just to the crops, but to trailers and silos for grain transportation and storage.

After apparent failures on the contact-tracing app and a change of heart on school opening dates and A-level results, face masks have become the latest issue in the spotlight. Here are of some of the government’s missteps so far:After hundreds of schools prepared to defy official Public Health England advice, which said it “does not recommend” face masks in schools, Boris Johnson made an 11th-hour U-turn on the issue days before classrooms were due to reopen. In lockdown areas with extra restrictions, wearing face coverings will become mandatory in school corridors where social distancing is difficult, and in other areas of England headteachers will have discretion over school policy. The move came after pressure from teachers around the country who urged their use, and following Scotland’s announcement that secondary school pupils should wear masks in communal areas.After months of pursuing a £10bn centralised contact-tracing model and hiring more than 18,000 tracers, the government appears to have conceded that a regional approach may be needed to respond to the pandemic. Local authorities had argued for months they had the expertise through their existing public health tracing teams, but it was only in August that the government decided to offer regional teams more support. The changes also mean the axing of 6,000 national call handlers by the end of August.The government was forced to abandon its coronavirus contact-tracing app, which it had been developing for three months and poured millions of pounds into, despite experts repeatedly warning that the app would not work. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, who previously said the app would be ready for nationwide rollout in mid-May after being trialled on the Isle of Wight, explained that the NHS would switch to a decentralised alternative designed by the US tech firms Apple and Google.Boris Johnson announced that the government would be providing food vouchers for some of England’s poorest families after a campaign launched by the footballer Marcus Rashford. It came just 24 hours after No 10 had rejected his plea for it to keep paying for the £15-a-week vouchers over the summer.The government’s goal was for all primary school children in England to be back in class for a month before the summer holiday. Earlier this month, however,  Williamson admitted that not all children would be able to return before the summer, with some having to wait until September.Johnson announced the government would allow shielding MPs to vote by proxy after an outcry over the treatment of parliamentarians with medical conditions. Those with disabilities said they felt they were being disenfranchised. The leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, firmly refused to endorse a proxy voting system and that MPs should instead be paired. Within days of Rees-Mogg’s comments, Johnson announced the change at prime minister’s questions.In the first major U-turn of his premiership, Johnson announced that overseas NHS staff and care workers would no longer have to pay a controversial visa surcharge. He had rejected calls to scrap it at PMQs the day before.A scheme granting indefinite leave to remain in the UK to relatives of foreign national NHS staff who die from Covid-19 was extended to low-paid workers after their exclusion attracted widespread criticism. The scheme, introduced in April, initially excluded cleaners, porters and social care workers.A fortnight after stressing that the evidence was weak on the benefits of face coverings, the government changed its advice to say they should be worn in enclosed spaces and on public transport. It later went further, with a new rule imposed on 15 June that anyone travelling on public transport in England must wear a face covering.The government stopped testing in the community on 12 March and retreated to testing principally in hospitals, according to a damning letter MPs sent to Johnson. The science and technology committee wrote in May that the consequences had been that care home residents and carers could not be tested “at a time when the spread of the virus was at its most rampant”. The government announced plans to rapidly scale up testing at the beginning of April, when  Hancock pledged 100,000 tests a day in England by the end of that month."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Loss equivalent to an ice sheet over landmass of Ireland to a depth of 300 metresDiesel and petrol consumption fell as transport restrictions took hold, report shows\u0026lsquoStaggering\u0026rsquo study indicates sea level rises could reach a metre by the end of the century"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"The by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4339570.1598465539!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"several beaches in dublin issued with do not swim notices","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA previous warning sign posted at Balbriggan Beach.

Photograph: Julien BehalPA WireA further 164 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in the Republic. No additional deaths were reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) on Wednesday.There have been a total of 1,777 deaths related to Covid-19 in the State\u0026nbspsince the pandemic began, along with 28,363 confirmed cases.The majority of the new cases, 93, were recorded in Dublin with 22 in Kildare, 10 in Tipperary, nine in Cork, eight in Carlow, six in Waterford, six in Offaly and the remaining 10 cases are spread between counties Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Louth and Roscommon.Close contacts of a confirmed case or outbreaks are associated with 80 of the cases. Community transmission accounts for 21.Eighty-three of Wednesday’s cases were in men with 81 in women and 65 per cent of the cases are in people under the age of 45.Validation of data at the Health Protection Surveillance Centre has resulted in the denotification of two cases – the current total reflects this.Acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said: “We have seen a significant number of cases in Dublin, Kildare, Tipperary, Limerick, Cork and Carlow over the past number of days. I would urge people everywhere to follow the public health advice and reduce mixing of households where at all possible.”Home infectionsMeanwhile, the number of coronavirus outbreaks of infections in family homes have doubled in a week, new figures from State health officials show.The latest report from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, the HSE unit that monitors the spread of the Covid-19 disease, shows that there were 156 family outbreaks in the month of August as of Sunday last. This was up from 78 a week earlier.An outbreak is defined as two cases or more of the disease.There have been more family outbreaks in August to date than the number reported in both June and July combined. There were 21 in June and 92 in July. This was down from highs of 715 in March, 545 in April and 101 in May.The increase in the number of infections in home and family settings has coincided with a spread of Covid-19 cases from meat processing plants and food factories to households.The rise in cases forced State public officials to impose new restrictions on house parties and gatherings in indoor settings.There have been 1,776 outbreaks of the disease in private houses, which account for the highest number of clusters, followed by nursing homes with 275 clusters of infection.Family outbreaks accounts for the vast majority of clusters in private houses. The bulk of the private house outbreaks have been in the more populated east of the country with 1,244 clusters.There have been 2,584 outbreaks in total during the pandemic.Midlands lockdownEarlier on Wednesday, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has said the local lockdown in Kildare, Laois and Offaly has “without a doubt” saved lives and signalled that further localised measures will be used to fight Covid-19 in Ireland.“They’ve saved lives in their own community and by helping suppress the spread of the virus around the country, they’ve saved lives all over the country.”He said that measures which avoid lockdown by “seeking out and minimising” situations where the virus spreads “are what we want to use”.“That’s the approach we’re using across Ireland – targeted measures to suppress the virus while keeping as much of our society and our economy open as possible,” he said.Testing at airportsMr Donnelly defended plans to introduce randomised testing at airports, saying it is “to provide an extra security measure in terms of testing and tracing,” after the scheme was criticised by Social Democrats co-leader Róisín Shortall.He said he would not yet commit to a public inquiry into deaths in nursing homes, and that consideration is needed as to the best approach for the families of people who have died.He said the winter plan will be launched several months early, and “it is not going to be cheap”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Local spikes in infection and targeted response measures is \u0026lsquonew reality\u0026rsquo, committee toldFingal County Council urges beach-goers to stay out of the water due to bacteria levelsTaoiseach says Hogan undermined the whole approach to public health in Ireland\u0026lsquoResidents are very frightened.

Photograph: British MuseumThe British Museum has moved a bust from public display of Irish-born doctor Sir Hans Sloane because he was a slaveowner. Sloane’s bust has been moved from a pedestal near the entrance to the London museum to the Enlightenment Gallery, which addresses Britain’s relationship with the slave trade. Sloane gifted his collection of 71,000 curios which he had collected in his lifetime to the nation. The collection is housed in both the British Museum and the Natural History Museum. Sloane was the seventh son of Alexander Sloane, an estate manager for the Hamilton family which still owns Killyleagh Castle in Co Down. Sloane was born in 1660 and the Hamiltons sponsored his medical education which led to him becoming the surgeon to the Royal Navy’s West Indies fleet and personal physician to the incoming governor of Jamaica. Through his marriage to Elizabeth Langley Rose, the daughter of Alderman John Langley, one of Jamaica’s largest slaveowners, he inherited large plantations and became a wealthy man. He used his money to transport thousands of plant specimens from the Caribbean to London and to invest in property in London. Sloane Square, one of London’s most fashionable addresses, and Hans Place, where the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed in December 1921, are named after him. The British Museum has now moved his bust from near the entrance to the Enlightenment Gallery which addresses Britain’s relationship with the slave trade. Potential stand-off“Sloane’s collection was created in the context of the British Empire and the slave economy”, a spokeswoman for the museum said. Hartwig Fischer, the director of the British Museum, told the Press Association that “dedication to truthfulness is crucial, when we face our own history. Sloane allows us to highlight the complexity and ambiguity of this period. He was a physician, collector, scholar, benefactor and slave owner.“We will continue to explore our history and we will do this in collaboration with people from across the globe to rewrite our shared, complicated and, at times, very painful history as equals.”A potential stand-off is now developing between the Black Lives Matter movement and the owners of another statue of Sloane which is in a public place. The statue stands in Duke of York Square in Chelsea and is owned by Cadogen Estates which has the freehold on hundreds of acres of land within the Royal Borough of Chelsea. Protest organiser Paul Matthias has said the image is “causing pain and suffering” and is an “insult” to the victims of slavery. A protest to remove the statue is scheduled for Friday. Cadogan Estates says it will not remove the statue. “We do not believe that removing the statue from Duke of York Square will help our understanding of the past, or improve the area and believe that Sir Hans should be assessed in his proper historical context and are actively considering how to contextualise the statue,” it said in a statement. There is also a statue of Sloane in the square of Killyleagh, but there are no plans to move it.

Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHSE chief executive Paul Reid: ‘We are going to see significant peaks, and, we hope, significant troughs very soon and those changes may not always be national.’ File photograph: Crispin RodwellLocal spikes in infection followed by targeted response measures is the “new reality” faced by the country, the Oireachtas Covid-19 committee has been told.Giving evidence to the Committee, Health Service Executive chief executive Paul Reid said that while there had been a focus on a second surge, “the reality is that what we are seeing in the country right now is probably what we are going to be living with for the future with this virus.”“We are going to see significant peaks, and, we hope, significant troughs very soon and those changes may not always be national,” Mr Reid said. “That is the new reality for us in terms of living with this virus and the transmission we have seen to date.”The committee also heard that only around half of close contacts of confirmed cases of Covid-19 are turning up for their second test for the virus, the Health Service Executive.Testing regimeNiamh O’Beirne, who is the HSE’s lead on testing strategy, told Fine Gael’s Fergus O’Dowd that close contacts are referred for two tests – on “day zero” and again a week later, known as “day seven” tests.“Somewhere between 70 and 80 per cent of people will show up for day zero tests, and on occasion it gets closer to 85 per cent,” she said. “On the day 7 tests, it is closer to 50 per cent. Looking at the age profiles, the cohorts who have the most difficulty tend to be the very young and the more elderly,” she said.She added that the HSE is examining different tests for children, including saliva tests, “to make it an easier appointment to attend”.The HSE were also questioned extensively about the State’s testing regime, as well as new specific testing programmes focused on the meat industry. The Committee heard that the median turnaround time for a test to be completed is now 2.2 days, and the average is 2.4 days.So far, three meat plants with a workforce of 2,254 have been tested, and a total of 50,000 employees will be covered by the serial testing programme, Mr Reid told Deputy Pádraig O’Sullivan. In direct provision centres, which will also be covered by a rolling – or “serial” – testing programme, some 8,000 residents and staff will be covered. This is on top of around 30,000 staff and residents in nursing homes, the committee was told.He said that serial testing “gives a lot of reassurance” but warned that it comes at a “very significant cost and absorbs a lot of resources”. “It is not the major tool with which we can protect the public,” he said, emphasising the importance of public health measures over testing as a way of controlling the virus.The HSE confirmed that the State is picking up the cost of testing in meat plants, but that where private testing is commissioned by inidual factories, it is not covered by the exchequer.CompensationLater in the day, the committee heard from Prof Philip Nolan, a member of the National Public Health Emergency Team, that self-isolation or restricted movements will continue to apply to travel. While testing improvements may allow for some scope to lessen restrictions, “realistically, in the long term, we are going to be living with restrictions on movement,” he said.Dr Ronan Glynn, the acting chief medical officer, said he didn’t see a scenario where there would be widespread travel in the coming months. He also told the committee that “adequate compensation” must be paid for those restricting their movements.“Economic circumstances simply should not be a barrier to people coming forward and getting tested,” he said.Prof Nolan also said that there was very little evidence of child to child transmission, and little evidence of child to adult transmission outside the household. He warned that it is “really important not to over-react when cases are detected in school”.Dr Glynn detailed two cases as examples of clusters linked to sport, with 22 and two positive cases identified in the respective outbreaks.Dr Glynn signalled that Kildare may see restrictions lifted early if the virus is felt to be at an acceptable level, which was later echoed by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4336912.1598194872!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how three irish exporters are facing the prospect of a hard brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMartin McVicar, co-founder and CEO CombiLift in the Monaghan factory. ‘We have controls in place.’ Photograph: Philip FitzpatrickExporters are turning their attention to the next looming challenge: the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union’s single market and customs union on January 1st without a trade deal.And while Covid-19 continues to dominate the news and adversely affect business, some companies are optimistic that they are prepared as best they can be for the consequences of a hard Brexit.Silverhill Foods of Emyvale in Co Monaghan has an annual turnover of more than €30 million with 70 per cent of the company’s weekly output of 80,000 ducks exported to 27 countries – 40 per cent of them to Chinese restaurants in the UK. The initial impact of Brexit was two price hikes of 10 per cent each, both caused by a fall in the sterling to euro exchange rate.But the impact on sales was virtually zero and a World Trade Organisation tariff of 7 per cent, which will apply to Silverhill goods entering the UK without a UKEU trade deal, doesn’t faze the company’s head of sales, Barry Cullen.“It’s not a major price difference,” he says. “We are a premium product. We are about twice as expensive as our competitors, so we’re not price sensitive.”Two years ago when the implications of Brexit were sinking in, the company leased temporary warehouse space near Manchester where 100 pallets, each holding 420 frozen ducks, could be stored, thus ensuring UK customers would continue to be supplied if ports became jammed. The warehouse option can be revived after January, if needs be.The Silverhill breed, which is half Aylesbury, half Peking, is popular in France, Germany, Scandinavia and the Far East so as regards exporting to the rest of the world, the company long ago abandoned the UK land bridge and exports now, via Dublin Port, to Cherbourg and Rotterdam.Silverhill duck has become a far-travelled delicacy. In Singapore, what is marketed as “London Fat Duck” began life as an egg in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone. It was hatched in Slieve Bragan, Co Monaghan and reared for 42 days on farms in Monaghan and Tyrone before being processed in Emyvale – all by a workforce of about 250.Cullen believes their UK customers, who are overwhelmingly ethnic Chinese enterprises, are well used to importing from outside the EU and the prospect of WTO tariffs and regulations doesn’t worry them. “They’re all fine about it,” he says.Longer term, Cullen sees Irish-based businesses turning away from the UK.Then there’s the prospect of increasing Silverhill’s burgeoning trade with the Far East.“Indonesia,” he says excitedly, “the population’s 260 million and you think it’s a poor country but you take the top one per cent. . . you start thinking in terms of selling pallets of duck and end up thinking of container loads.”PortwestLike Silverhill, warehousing became a solution for another major exporter, Portwest, the €180 million turnover, outdoor leisure and work clothing company which is based in Westport, Co Mayo and employs 4,500 people worldwide.“Before Brexit we had one main distribution warehouse in the UK, with 250 staff, serving every country in the EU,” says Portwest managing director Harry Hughes. “After Theresa May announced that the UK were leaving the customs union, we decided to open a second distribution warehouse in Poland and were ready when the first deadline passed.”The Polish warehouse has 150 staff and serves all of Portwest’s EU customers. The UK warehouse, with 100 fewer staff, serves UK and Portwest’s non-EU customers – England’s loss was Poland’s gain.“We are now Brexit-proof from issues associated with customs and borders,” says Hughes. “No company will be exempt from the possible political or commercial fallout.”CombiLiftCombiLift is another Monaghan-based company with a global reach that has also had to react to the potential worst-case scenario in January.The company, a hugely successful maker of forklift trucks, has grown over 22 years into a €300 million turnover enterprise employing 650 people.Most of the staff work at an enormous assembly plant that is 11 acres under roof and sits on a 100 acre site at the edge of Monaghan town. Four production lines, now working two at a time in staggered shifts because of Covid-19 distancing restrictions, crank out customised forklifts trucks.Their multi-directional wheel and steering system gives them extra manoeuvrability, allowing them operate in very confined spaces. This allows CombiLift to market itself as a space saver, selling customers the notion that their existing warehouse has greater capacity, if storage aisles are reconfigured and made narrower, thereby allowing for more shelving.While the company’s two largest markets, accounting for half of output, are the UK and US, it also exports to more than 80 countries throughout Europe and the Americas, as well as to Asia, Africa and Australia.The company’s single most significant response to Brexit was to obtain from Revenue the status of Authorised Economic Operator (AEO), a process that took 10 months and culminated in the issuing of a prized AEO certificate in June 2019.What the status means in effect is that the CombiLift plant in Monaghan becomes a customs and excise frontline, rather than the frontline being at the port through which exports flow. On a day-to-day basis, this means the plant operates like a bonded warehouse so when finished products or spare parts reach a port, they pass through the green channel, without delay and unchecked.“You become a trusted partner with Revenue and as long as you do everything properly, there is no reason for them to check what you do.”That said, the plant can be subject to inspection at any time and the perimeter of the site is laser beam protected. CCTV is everywhere.CombiLift has an articulated truck or container leaving the Monaghan plant every hour of every day. The company also takes in 40 truck-loads of imported parts, the company’s manufacturing raw materials.Whatever way Brexit pans out in January, CombiLift will be able to deliver spare parts to UK customers overnight.So McVicar hasn’t given up on the UK.“Whatever happens in Brexit is not going to stop us investing there, for multiple reasons,” he says. “The UK clients are still going to need forklift trucks to move goods around. In fact, their demand for warehousing space is going to be at a higher premium because the minute a company comes out of that European block, they’ll want to want to make sure they’ve goods on their island.“UK companies are going to be stocking higher levels of components and food to deal with border scenarios and where our products come into value is, even though we make forklift trucks, we are actually in the business of selling warehouse space. We sell forklift trucks that save warehouse space and as the demand for warehousing increases, there’s more demand for our product.“So even post-Brexit, whether there’s no deal or there is a deal, we’re still going to invest in the UK.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File photograph: BloombergPhil Hogan is to\u0026nbspresign as Ireland\u0027s European Commissioner in the wake of the controversy over his\u0026nbspbreaches of public safety restrictions in Ireland, the  understands.Last week, Mr Hogan attended the Oireachtas Golf Society event in Clifden, with 80 others, and his movements to and from the controversial event while coronavirus restrictions were in place have been under scrutiny.Mr Hogan had come under increasing pressure after he was asked to give an account of his movements while in Ireland by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.His itinerary revealed he had not completed 14 days of self-isolation according to the rules for incoming travellers, and contradicted earlier statements from a spokeswoman for the Commission that claimed he had isolated for the full two weeks.This raised questions about whether he had misled his employer about his movements.In addition, eyewitnesses came forth to say that in the week after his arrival in Ireland he had not been isolating, but instead had been using the public restaurant, bar and library of the K Club hotel and golf resort in Co Kildare.The departure means Ireland will have to nominate a new Commissioner to replace Mr\u0026nbspHogan. It is unclear whether Ireland will retain the key trade portfolio, as this is at the discretion of Dr\u0026nbspvon der Leyen, who may choose to reshuffle her Commissioners.Earlier, Taoiseach Micheál Martin\u0026nbsp said Mr \u0026nbspHogan has “undermined the whole approach to public health in Ireland” but stopped short of saying he did not have confidence in the EU trade commissioner.Speaking in Dublin on Wednesday, Mr Martin said there has been a “significant difficulty for the Government in terms of the changing narrative as this story has unfolded”.He said he had spoken to Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar and the Green Party’s Eamon Ryan about the issue.“People across the country have made great sacrifices in adhering to the guidance in relation to Covid-19. The three leaders met yesterday and we discussed this, we issued a statement and that is the key assessment from us in terms of the degree to which the guidelines were not adhered to in respect of the commissioner.”However, Mr Martin said he wanted to honour the “demarcation” of power between the European Commission and national governments.He said EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen had to work within the parameters of European treaties when assessing the situation.“I’m not going to in any way seek to influence or interfere with the president’s competence in that regard,” he said.Stopping short of declaring that he does not have confidence in Mr Hogan, Mr Martin said “the commissioner is accountable to the Commission, not to the Oireachtas and not the Government”.Earlier, however, Mr Ryan said the administration had lost confidence in Mr Hogan because of the lack of immediate transparency and communication from him.The  has reported fresh eyewitness claims Mr Hogan was not self-isolating when he should have been.Questions about Mr Hogan dominated a Brussels press conference hosted by European Commission spokeswoman Dana Spinant on Wednesday.The trade commissioner submitted a timeline of his movements to Dr von der Leyen that was quickly called into question as new information emerged about his whereabouts, and the HSE and Citizens Information service denied his interpretation of coronavirus rules.“The president is studying carefully the report that was submitted by Commissioner Hogan yesterday,” Ms Spinant told journalists, describing the matter as “a serious one”.“The president is in contact with Commissioner Hogan about it. On the other hand, we have taken note of the statement by Irish authorities.”The HSE and Citizens Information issued statements saying that all incoming travellers from non-Green List countries must stay in self isolation for 14 days even if they test negative for Covid-19, contradicting Mr Hogan’s justification for cutting short his quarantine.The Commission spokeswoman said that according to their information, Mr Hogan had complied with Belgium’s two-week quarantine obligation on his return from Ireland this weekend and emphasised it was important for all officials to follow the rules.“This is a matter which is of course important for all commissioners as well as for all Commission officials,” Ms Spinant said.“It is a matter that the president takes seriously and we expect compliance by Commission officials with those requirements which indeed we need to be alert as they are changing rapidly.”Ms Spinant could not give an estimate of when Dr von der Leyen would conclude her assessment of Mr Hogan’s account.On Wednesday morning, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said the Clifden event had been “an absolute disgrace” and “a slap in the face” for the public.Mr Donnelly called on Mr Hogan to “listen to the Taoiseach and Tánaiste” and to consider resigning because of the controversy from the event.In a statement on Tuesday night, the leaders of the three Government parties said that “concerns remain” about Mr Hogan’s movements after arriving in Ireland last month and the manner in which he has explained them.Senior sources confirmed it remained the view of the Government that Mr Hogan should resign as commissioner, and it is understood that Dr von der Leyen is aware of this.However, Government Buildings sources acknowledge the matter of his future is a decision for the commission president. Sources say, however, that there have been extensive contacts between officials.The Government statement, the latest development in a controversy that has transfixed domestic politics since last week, came after a dramatic day when Mr Hogan delivered a lengthy explanation of his attendance at the controversial Oireachtas golf dinner and a timeline of his movements in the period preceding the event.He again apologised for his attendance at the event but insisted that he did not break any health guidelines – saying that a negative Covid-19 test excused him from quarantining after arriving here from Belgium and that exemptions for essential work meant he was permitted to break the local lockdown in Co Kildare.Mr Hogan said it was there in “black and white” on the Citizens Information website that anyone who has had a negative result in a Covid-19 test was no longer required to self-isolate.But the Department of Health disputed this, saying this did not apply to people arriving in the country, who were required to complete their period of quarantine despite a negative test.Other elements of Mr Hogan’s explanation have also been called into doubt. Mr Hogan dined in a public restaurant at the K Club on the night he flew into Ireland from Brussels last month, according to a woman who saw him in the restaurant.The Leinster woman, who did not want to be named, told The  that Mr Hogan dined with two other guests at the table behind her and her husband on the night of Friday, July 31st.“We were there for our wedding anniversary he was seated at the table behind us with two other gentlemen,” she said.The revelations undermine Mr Hogan’s claims on Tuesday that he flew into Ireland on July 31st and “self-isolated for the days up to the 5th of August”, when he tested negative for Covid-19 at a medical appointment in a Dublin hospital.A spokesman for Mr Hogan had no comment to make on the July 31st dinner.The woman who said she sat at the table next to his that night said she was “totally surprised” that Mr Hogan was now claiming that he abided by public health rules.Another woman, Niamh Duffy, from Co Cork, said she stayed at the K Club during the first week of August and saw Mr Hogan using public areas of the resort when he should have been self-isolating.The  has also learned that Mr Hogan made a social visit to Co Roscommon on August 17th that was not disclosed in the itinerary of his movements published by the European Commission.It is understood Mr Hogan paid a social visit in the county on the day in which he travelled from Co Kilkenny to Co Galway via Co Kildare.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4338833.1598388157!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who attended the golf dinner and what has happened to them since","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“You are hounding everybody, so no comment and goodbye,” said guest Loman Dempsey when contacted. Illustration: iStockMore than 80 guests attended an Oireachtas Golf Society dinner in the Station House Hotel, Clifden, Co Galway, last Wednesday at a time when Government regulations strictly limited indoor gatherings. Here is who was at it:Mr Calleary resigned as minister in the fallout from the event. Mr Hogan is now under intense pressure over his position.Former Fianna Fáil TD and senator Donie Cassidy had a table as president of the golf society. The Westmeath politician had eight guests at his table, according to the seating plan – understood to be mainly members of his family. Mr Cassidy resigned as vice-president of Fianna Fáil following the controversy.The society’s 50th anniversary event paid tribute to the late Mark Killilea, a founding member of the group and former Fianna Fáil MEP. Several members of the Killilea family attended the dinner, and his son, Fianna Fáil councillor Donagh Killilea, gave a speech. Former Fianna Fáil minister and property developer Frank Fahey was also at this table.The table included Senator Paddy Burke and councillor Enda McGloin, who both lost the Fine Gael whip as a result of their attendance. Dr Michael Harty, former TD and chair of the Oireachtas health committee, was also at the table.Others included former Fine Gael senator Paul Coghlan, and John Flaherty, captain of the guard at Leinster House, who is responsible for health and safety in the Houses of the Oireachtas.Supreme Court judge Séamus Woulfe and Fianna Fáil Senator Paul Daly have both apologised for their attendance at the event.Mr Justice Woulfe, who is a former attorney general, is now facing a Supreme Court-ordered review by former chief justice Susan Denham into whether he should have attended the event.Daly, who attended the event with his partner, Bernie, was stripped of the party whip last week by Taoiseach Micheál Martin.Galway businessman and owner of the Station House Hotel John Sweeney and his wife, Treena, were listed as guests at the table, as was the ambassador of Morocco.Chief executive of the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland Brian Hayes was seated here, alongside former Fine Gael senator Imelda Henry.Hayes, who is a former Fine Gael junior minister and MEP, apologised for attending the event, but said it did not affect his ability to fulfil his role as head of the BPFI. According to the seating plan, he also had three unnamed guests at the table.Henry, who is no longer in politics and owns a consulting firm, apologised “unreservedly” for attending the event, adding that she attended in a personal capacity.Two Fianna Fáil Senators, Aidan Davitt and Niall Blaney, were among those seated at this table. Both have apologised for attending.Taoiseach Micheál Martin has removed the party whip from both Senators. Mr Davitt has served as a Senator since 2016, while Mr Blaney was elected to the Seanad in 2020.Guests at this table included Fine Gael Senator Jerry Buttimer, who resigned as Leas Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, over the affair. His husband, Conchobar Ó Laoghaire, was also listed as a guest. Buttimer has said it was an “unintended but serious lapse of judgment in attending the event”.Other guests were Senator John Cummins, twice mayor of Waterford and one of three Fine Gael Senators who had the party whip removed from them over the scandal, and Pat McCartan, a former Workers Party TD and now retired Circuit Court judge. Mr McCartan serves as vice-captain of the Oireachtas Golf Society.Also at the table was former Independent TD Paudge Connolly, now a Monaghan county councillor. The  revealed he was playing golf in Spain nine days previous to the dinner. Spain is not on the Government’s green list of countries, meaning people arriving back from there must quarantine for 14 days. Mr Connolly has yet to respond to a request for comment.Former Fianna Fáil minister of state with responsibility for older people Áine Brady and her husband, Gerry, also a former Fianna Fáil TD for Kildare and a local auctioneer, headed up this table. Neither have responded to phone calls.Kildare was under tightened lockdown restrictions at the time of the golf dinner, which meant residents were restricted to travel within the county, except for work, vital family or medical reasons. Brady is chief executive of Third Age, an organisation that supports older people in Ireland.In a statement reported by the Leinster Leader, she said she was “disappointed that my actions may have distracted from the tremendous work that the organisation does, and I will redouble my efforts to ensure that these programmes will continue to deliver positive outcomes for older people and communities in Ireland.” She added: “I unreservedly apologise and deeply regret my attendance at last week’s event.”There were eight other, as yet unidentified, guests at the Brady table, according to the table plans.Among the guests listed was Loman Dempsey, a property consultant and brother of former Fianna Fáil government minister Noel Dempsey.“I have no comment to make about that. You are hounding everybody, so no comment and goodbye,” he said when asked about his attendance.Sean Dempsey, a former school principal who regularly canvassed for his brother Noel, was also listed as a guest.Martin Brett, deputy chairman of Kilkenny County Council, was also at this table, along with a friend, Gerry Crowley. Mr Brett has said attendees were being wrongly “pilloried” and anyone who resigned over the scandal should be reinstated.“There has been a serious level of witch hunt against everybody that was at the dinner … We didn’t breach any guidelines,” he said. Others listed at the table included Anne and Ciaran Dooley, who Mr Brett said, “worked in Brussels at one stage”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4339279.1598448904!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eyewitnesses surprised to spot phil hogan in public areas at k club","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEyewitnesses saw EU commissioner Phil Hogan using public areas of the K ClubTwo eyewitnesses who saw EU commissioner Phil Hogan using public areas of the K Club have expressed surprise that he did not self-isolate for 14 days after returning from Brussels.Government public health guidelines state that anyone returning from a country that is not on the green list must restrict their movements for 14 days after their arrival.Mr Hogan claimed that he “self-isolated for the days up to the 5th of August” when he tested negative for Covid-19 at a medical appointment after he flew back into Ireland on July 31st.HSE guidance does not state that a negative test shortens the 14-day restricted movement requirement. Belgium is not on the green list, compelling Mr Hogan to restrict his movements.Mr Hogan has insisted that he did not breach any health guidelines.The three coalition party leaders in Government said on Wednesday night, after Mr Hogan submitted a report on his movements, that “it is clear that breaches of public health guidelines were made by commissioner Hogan since he travelled to Ireland.”July 31stA Leinster woman told The  that she saw Mr Hogan dining with two other guests at the table behind her and her husband on the night of Friday, July 31st, the day he arrived in Ireland.The couple were celebrating their wedding anniversary and dined in the restaurant of the K Club resort, Co Kildare, where Mr Hogan has a home, for two hours from about 8.30pm.“He is saying that he was in lockdown until August 5th. He was out in an open restaurant, a public restaurant, among plenty of other guests. Sure that’s not staying in self-isolation,” she said.The woman said Mr Hogan and the two other men sat at a “big round table” behind her and her husband, and that the restaurant was “very well set up” to manage social distancing safely.She said she is “totally surprised” that he is now claiming that he abided by public health guidance and that he self-isolated when he was openly dining out in a public restaurant.“He is beating around the bush by saying that between the 31st and the 5th he stayed in his residence in Kildare,” she said.“I am surprised that other people have not come forward. It was just blatant.”Mr Hogan’s spokesman offered no comment about the July 31st dinner.Another woman, Niamh Duffy who is from Co Cork, said that she stayed at the K Club with her husband and three children the first week of August.She said that she saw Mr Hogan meeting two others, a man and a woman, in the bar of the resort on Thursday, August 6th. She expressed concerns that he did not self-isolate during the 14-day restricted movement period after travelling from a non-green list country.Public figure“I was disappointed that a public figure like himself who more than anybody should know and understand the rules around self-isolation and social distancing, that he should have been, like everyone else, adhering to those guidelines,” said Ms Duffy.“Self-isolating means that you stay in your home for two weeks and don’t leave. People deliver your food to you. He shouldn’t have been in a setting where other people were circulating.”She said she also spotted him on another occasion in the breakfast room of the K Club used by other guests during her stay at the Co Kildare golf resort.Ms Duffy said that she knows people who have returned to Ireland from abroad and who have had to organise separate housing in order to stay away from their families because of Covid-19.“A lot of people have made a lot of effort to self-isolate coming into the country. It seems strange that he did not see fit to protect the Irish people,” she said.Mr Hogan’s spokesman did not respond to queries from The  about his movements at the K Club during August 6th and 7th.In a detailed statement to the EU Commission, published on Wednesday, Mr Hogan said he returned “briefly” to his “temporary residence in Co Kildare” on Thursday, August 6th, after being discharged from hospital.He said he travelled to Kilkenny before the local lockdown rules came into effect on midnight in Co Kildare on August 7th."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4338846.1598391186!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government believes phil hogan should resign as fresh claims emerge","story":"EU spokesperson Dana Spinant says that European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen considers the controversy regarding the movements of Phil Hogan during a summer trip to Ireland to be serious.

Hopefully it’s the beginning of many more deals,” he said, referring to the trade agreement that he states he was working on during his controversial trip to Co Galway last week.“Trade between the two global blocs in the world is very important,” he said. “We trade $3 billion a day.

They will have to decide if a serving politician should take the role - as is usually the case, politicians being in favour of giving politicians jobs - or someone with an official background but who understands how Brussels works. On Wednesday morning, the Brussels based politico.eu website reported that David O’Sullivan, formerly the highest-ranking official in the Commission, could be a possible replacement for Hogan if he goes, while others have suggested that Catherine Day, who succeeded O’Sullivan in that role, might fill the gap. But both Brussels and Dublin sources play down either possibility, but a technocrat like Day or O’Sullivan could perhaps hold on to the trade portfolio, Brussels sources say.Appointing a serving politician from Dublin to the role presents the problem of a byelection. No government ever wants a byelection, but this Government will want to avoid one even more than most. On the other hand, a contest does not have to take place immediately it could be put off until early 2021, and the Government – assuming it is still in office at that point – has a solid enough majority to survive a defeat.Fine Gael sources insist that any replacement would be a “Fine Gael nomination”, assuming that Martin and Varadkar have agreed that the next Commissioner – due to be appointed in four years – would be a Fianna Fáil appointment. If this sounds rather like vying up the spoils of office in advance, this is an important part of making a coalition government work.Fine Gael politicians whose names are circulating include Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, who was recently elected as head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers. The loss of either would be domestic blow to the party. The Covid-19 pandemic has seen Simon Harris grow in stature, but his appointment would be a surprise, while Minister forJustice Helen McEntee has European experience, but is new to Cabinet.There has been recurrent speculation that Varadkar himself might seek the Government’s nomination – in which case he would surely be granted it – but while he is very much at home in Brussels and fascinated by its power politics, it is hard to see him turning his back on both Irish politics and his party at such a relatively young age.Coveney seems a more likely emissary – as a former MEP and current Minister for Foreign Affairs, he knows Brussels and is known there. Some of his Fine Gael colleagues believe he might be tempted, though it would mean giving up his domestic political ambitions, generally reckoned not to have been totally extinguished by the victory of Varadkar in the 2017 Fine Gael leadership contest.One Government source suggested that Richard Bruton, the vastly experienced former minister, could slot in to the role, although if Brussels sources are correct that an Irish politician would be unlikely to retain the trade portfolio, his appointment would bring the danger of a byelection without the benefit of creating an extra Cabinet place for a Fine Gael minister.Gossip in Brussels also suggests that the name of MEP Mairead McGuinness could be in the frame, though Fine Gael sources play down the prospect.With Hogan gone, the Government is likely to want to name a successor quickly, the better to draw a line under the affair. The question of who is getting the big job always transfixes the political class, though the public largely don’t care about it, or are actively hostile to protracted public discussion on the point. Many of them see politicians as only out for themselves anyway. This sorry episode will have done nothing to persuade them otherwise."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Long-serving president already general secretary of the party and head of the militaryTed Hui and Lam Cheuk-ting detained as part of crackdown under new security lawVictims and relatives seek life without parole for man who killed 51 in 2019 attackResearchers say man had no Covid-19 symptoms the second time, suggesting immune system kept virus somewhat in checkLocals and police search the debris after five-storey structure crumbles in MahadLuon Sovath, who has spent decades fighting for human rights, was the victim of a vicious smear campaign this summerFears that country teetering on edge of major outbreak supported by data on rise in daily casesWhite supremacist killed 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in March 2019Health condition \u0026lsquovery worrying\u0026rsquo after drinking tea that allies believe was laced with poisonDecision to transfer Kremlin critic ill with suspected poisoning after day of lobbyingProtests over last two months most serious threat yet to prime minister\u0026rsquos administrationLack of foreign visitors has facilitated increase in poaching and loss of revenueReport by US intelligence agencies sheds light on actions \u0026ndash and inactions \u0026ndash that created global crisisTens of thousands evacuated as record-breaking rains hit country\u0026rsquos southwestCountry entering dangerous new phase of rising infections in small towns and villagesUS president \u0026lsquopatently wrong\u0026rsquo when telling Minnesota crowd New Zealand situation \u0026lsquoterrible\u0026rsquoPolling put back by four weeks as 49 Covid-19 cases recorded in AucklandStudent-led demonstrations gain momentum testing laws protecting royal familyCovid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335701.1598013937!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk time wasting makes deal unlikely says barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit negotiator Michel Barnier: “Frankly I am disappointed and I am worried.”  Photograph: Yves HermanPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesThe EU’s Brexit negotiator has warned that valuable time is being wasted in trade talks with the UK as he accused his British counterparts of failing to make progress on topics of key interest to Europe during the latest round of trade negotiations. Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4339440.1598457168!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"texas and louisiana brace for arrival of hurricane laura","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA bar is boarded up on the nearly deserted Strand Street in Galveston, Texas as business owners and residents wait for Hurricane Laura on Wednesday, August 27th. Photograph: Jennifer ReynoldsThe Galveston County Daily News via APHurricane Laura was expected to rapidly strengthen to a Category 4 hurricane on Wednesday on a steady track to hit the Texas-Louisiana Gulf Coast after dark, causing catastrophic damage, the National Hurricane Centre said.The storm, already a Category 3 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale for measuring hurricane intensity, was about 465km southeast of Galveston, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 185kmh, the Miami-based forecaster said. Category 4 hurricanes can pack winds of up to 250kmh.Skies were dark and a light rain was falling on Wednesday morning in the island city of Galveston, which was mostly boarded up.Randall Gilmore, a 48-year-old maintenance worker, was riding his bike along the city’s sea wall, watching the clouds roll in. Work had prevented him from evacuating yet, but he planned to move to nearby Texas City in the afternoon.“This storm doesn’t look like it’ll be bad so far, but I feel it’s better to leave. You never know what to expect with these storms. Sometimes hurricanes can fuel tornadoes, and I don?t want to be here in Galveston if that happens,” Mr Gilmore said.More than 420,000 Texas residents and another 200,000 people in neighbouring Louisiana were under mandatory evacuation orders on Wednesday.“You only have a few hours to prepare and evacuate for #HurricaneLaura. Wherever you are by noon is where you?ll have to ride out the storm,” Louisiana governor John Edwards tweeted Wednesday morning.Crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico has been paralysed as companies batten down operations. Output cuts are nearing 90 per cent, a level not seen since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.State and federal emergency management agencies were rushing to provide shelter accommodations and get first responders in place.Inland penetrationFederal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Pete Gaynor posted pictures of teams bringing portable shelters to Camp Beauregard, Louisiana on Tuesday, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott said his state’s National Guard was in place with high-water vehicles and rescue helicopters.The storm was moving at about 24 kmh per hour Wednesday morning. Storm surge along the Gulf Coast could raise water levels to as high as 3.7m to 4.6m in Intracoastal City and Morgan City, Louisiana, and Laura would likely drop 13 to 25cm of rain over the region, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.“This storm surge could penetrate up to 30 miles inland from the immediate coastline in southwestern Louisiana and far southeastern Texas,” the NHC said in a Wednesday morning advisory. “All preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion in the next few hours.”The storm was also expected to spawn tornadoes Wednesday night over Louisiana, far southeastern Texas, and southwestern Mississippi, the NHC said. It added there would likely be widespread flooding in urban areas from far eastern Texas across Louisiana and Arkansas from Wednesday to Thursday.Laura battered the Caribbean over the weekend, killing 24 people between the Dominican Republic and Haiti and damaging thousands of homes and electricity infrastructure.Social distanced shelteringTexas is just coming down from a period of peak Covid-19 cases and deaths, and there are currently some 108,000 active cases of the virus, according to the state health department. More than 41,000 hospital beds were occupied by Covid-19 patients as of Tuesday, including more than 12,000 in Houston and Galveston, state data showed.Hidalgo County, Texas, urged voluntary evacuation in the coastal region surrounding Houston, and shelters were set up in San Antonio, Dallas and Austin. Thousands of evacuees would be sheltered at hotels in Austin to encourage social distancing, the Austin American-Statesman reported.Houston, which lies in Laura’s path and has closed public Covid-19 testing sites ahead of the storm, was pummelled in 2017 by Hurricane Harvey, which killed at least 68 people and caused $125 billion (€105 billion) in property damage. The fourth largest US city, with 2.3 million residents, Houston is about 70km north of the open water of the Gulf of Mexico.Lina Hidalgo, the top executive for Harris County, which encompasses Houston, warned of deadly winds and a destructive storm surge after Laura makes landfall.“This storm certainly can cause unprecedented devastation,” Hidalgo said at a news conference on Tuesday. “We truly have to say: Prepare for the worst.” – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"british team help free iranian sailors held longest ever somali","story":"A British-led mercy mission has helped secure the release of a group of Iranian sailors held hostage in the last and longest-running hijacking of the Somali piracy crisis.Four crewmen from the Siraj, an Iranian fishing vessel hijacked off the Somali coast in March 2015, were freed last week after five and a half years in captivity.  Their captors are said to have treated them like goats at times, feeding them only occasionally and not caring if they starved to death.The deal to free the sailors - which included the payment of a $180,000 ransom - was brokered by the Hostage Support Partnership, a pro-bono organisation co-ordinated by John Steed, a retired British diplomat based in Kenya. Since 2013, Mr Steed\u0027s team have helped to free the crews of three other hijacked ships, all of whom had been in captivity for at least three years. The ships’ owners were all uninsured, leaving them unable to pay the ransoms demanded by the pirates and robbing the hostages of any chance of freedom. Working with Leslie Edwards, a UK-based hostage negotiation specialist, Mr Steed persuaded the pirates to accept a token expenses payment that was a fraction of the multi-million dollar ransoms they originally sought. The money was usually sourced from well wishers within the international shipping industry.In the latest case involving the Siraj, private Iranian donors raised and delivered the $180,000, but the deal itself - which included complex negotiations with the pirates and securing proof that the hostages were still alive - was brokered by Mr Steed\u0027s team over the course of many months.“This marks the end of an era of Somali piracy and the pain and suffering of Somalia’s forgotten hostages,” said Mr Steed.Mr Steed and his team became involved in the negotiations for the Siraj after concluding that the ship’s owners, who were again believed to have been uninsured, were not going to be able to help. While the work was done with help from a number of Iranian diplomats, it is understood that the case struggled to attract attention from the highest levels of the Iranian government.Claims were made that the hostages were left in limbo because they were Baluchis, an ethnic minority sometimes seen as second-class citizens in Iran. Four other hostages from the ship were freed two years ago, and another, Mohammed Jaffrey, was released on humanitarian grounds after he suffered from serious ill-health. Pictures of him taken during captivity showed that he was so malnourished that he appeared to have aged prematurely. The case will be seen as a rare example of British and Iranian co-operation on hostage affairs, despite the ongoing diplomatic tensions between London and Tehran. It contrasts with the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian citizen held for four years by the Iranian government on spying charges.  A BBC Panorama program aired this week alleged that Tehran was holding her “hostage” in the hope of securing payment of a £400m debt owed to it by Britain from the 1970s.The crew of the Siraj were the last of the sailors kidnapped during the Somali piracy crisis, and their release marks the closure of a traumatic chapter in modern seafaring history. It is estimated that more than 2,000 sailors were hijacked during the peak years between 2005-2012, with up to a half a billion dollars being paid out in ransoms. Hijacking cases plummeted after cargo ships began putting armed guards on board in pirate-prone areas.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed top baby names england wales 2019 popular name","story":"It can be one of the most difficult decisions new parents have to make - choosing the name of your child which they will carry through life, shaping how they are perceived by their peers or even their opportunities in life.The question is  - do you play it safe and walk the tried and tested route or go out on a limb? An ordinary name that doesn\u0027t draw attention or something more outlandish?The Office for National Statistics (ONS) have now revealed the most popular baby names for last year, with detailed stats on exactly how many children were given each name in England and Wales.You can search for your name via the interactive tool below to see whether a name is going in or out of fashion.Did parents in 2019 beat Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds to the name Wilfred - which languished in 143rd place in the 2018 rankings of boys names with just 383 births?Amid the Royal fallout have British parents followed Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s lead after the birth of Archie last year? In previous years new parents in Britain have been generally reliable in their most common picks for the top names, and this year is no different.For the three years to 2018 Oliver and Olivia were crowned the most popular baby names in England and Wales, and this year they cemented that status.Oliver has been the most popular boys\u0027 name since 2013 while Olivia replaced Amelia in top place in 2016.Among the top boy\u0027s names Alfred, Chester, Hudson, Ibrahim and Oakley entered the 2019 top 100 - replacing Alex, Dexter, Dominic, Kai, Sonny and Tobias.Lara and Mabel replaced Aisha and Francesca in the top 100 girls’ names Mabel has not been in the top 100 since 1924.In 2019, Freya and Lily entered the top 10 replacing Ella and Emily. This is the first time Freya has been in the top 10 most popular girls’ names, while it is the first time Emily has not been in the top 10 since 1984. Margaret and Mary were the only girls’ names to have featured in the top 10 for a longer period of time than Emily.In contrast to the top 10 girls’ names, there were no new entries in the top 10 boys’ names. Arthur continued its recent rise, now at its highest position since records began in 1904 as the fourth most popular boys’ name, 11 years since returning to the top 100.The regional variation in top boys’ names continued in 2019 when, despite Oliver being the top name in England and Wales overall, it was only top in the East Midlands, the East of England, the South West and Wales.Muhammad remained the most popular boys’ name in the North West, Yorkshire and The Humber, the West Midlands, and London while Harry and Arthur were the most popular boys’ names in the North East and South East respectively. Of all the Arthurs born in England and Wales, a fifth were born in the South East.David Corps, vital statistics outputs branch at the ONS, said: “Oliver and Olivia continued their reign as the top boys’ and girls’ names in 2019, but analysis shows choices in baby names can differ depending on the mother’s age. We found younger mothers opted for more modern girls’ names like Harper, which has seen a rise since the Beckhams named their daughter so in 2011, and shortened boys’ names like Freddie. In contrast, older mothers chose more traditional names such as Jack and Charlotte.”Which names have been driven by celebrity and popular culture? Has the rise in popularity in some names been born out of new music and films, and which names have faded into obscurity?Since 2016, when the Amazon Alexa was first available in the UK, the girls’ name Alexa has decreased in popularity from 2016 when there were 332 girls named Alexa to just 39 in 2019.In contrast, a girls’ name that may have increased following the rise to fame of a celebrity is the name Dua. Dua Lipa, the popstar, had her first UK number one single in 2017. In that time, the number of girls named Dua has doubled from 63 in 2017 to 126 in 2019 this is the highest number since our annual records began in 1996.Similar trends have been seen in boys’ names where the name Taron has increased in popularity, with 48 boys born in 2019 being given this name, the most since detailed records began in 1996. This choice in name might be influenced by the actor Taron Egerton who starred in the 2019 award-winning Elton John biopic, Rocketman.Continuing the cinematic trends, the name Kylo appears to have increased in popularity since the release of the new Star Wars sequel trilogy. Kylo Ren, a leading character, first appeared in 2015. Since then, the number of boys named Kylo has risen from 10 to 67 in 2019.Despite the last season of Game of Thrones leaving fans disappointed, names from the fantasy series are still cropping up on birth certificates, with four girls named Daenerys in 2019.Looking back to 1996, when detailed annual rankings of baby names first became available, we have seen names rise and fall and some all but disappear completely.The first name Corbyn faded into obscurity in 2019, with fewer than two babies named Corbyn in the same year the former Labour leader crashed to a devastating election defeat.The ONS suppresses any figures fewer than two, and it is the first time there have been no entries for Corbyn since 1996. In 2018 12 baby boys were named Corbyn.The girls’ names Brittany and Kerry were reasonably popular 20 years ago, with Brittany the 101st most popular name in 1999, and Kerry was 136th in 1996. However, in 2019, there were two or fewer children given these names.There were similar cases for boys’ names. In 2019, there were two or fewer boys named Kieren or Glenn for the first time since our detailed annual rankings were first available in 1996.Kieren’s highest rank was in 1997 when it reached 169th position. The more popular spelling of this name, Kieran, has declined too, decreasing from 89th position in 2010 to 374th in 2019. Meanwhile, Glenn was once the 95th most popular boys’ name in 1964.The steepest fall from the top 100 boy\u0027s names in 1996 is the name MacAuley, which held 95th spot but has since fallen to rank 2,488, with eight births in 2019.For the first time this year there were no entries for the boy\u0027s name Neville, suggesting the name is facing extinction. There were also two or less baby girls named Debra, though there were four girls named Debbie.Other names thought to be extinct have clawed their way back this year - notably Nigel. Not a single baby had the name on their birth certificate in 2016, but last year nine new Nigels came into the world.  The statistics are derived  from the names as they appear on the birth certificate of the child and, as such, don\u0027t factor in differing or similar pronunciations. Grouping names with similar pronunciation would change the rankings.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/08/26/16/gemma-collins-joaquin-phoenix.jpg","title":"gemma collins joaquin phoenix podcast joker bbc sounds","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘TOWIE’ star professed her crush on actor, despite both mispronouncing and struggling to remember his nameGemma Collins spectacularly butchered the pronunciation of Joaquin Phoenix’s name on her podcast while asking him to marry her.The internet personality and TOWIE star confessed on her BBC Sounds podcast that she had a crush on Phoenix and wished for him to propose to her, but struggled to both pronounce and remember his name.While answering a question from an artistic fan, who wanted suggestions on who she could draw, Collins suggested a number of people in the public eye.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCollins suggested herself, “The GC”, as someone the fan could draw, along with Boris Johnson.

What a fantastic actor … Sorry to keep going on about Jarquin Cortez, but I do have a crush on him right now.”Collins’ butchering of Phoenix’s name quickly earned comparisons to John Travolta, who wildly mispronounced the name of Wicked actor Idina Menzel during the 2014 Oscars.As he introduced a musical performance by Menzel, Travolta called her “the wickedly talented Adele Dazeem”.“Gemma Collins has truly relegated Adele Dazeem and Dula Peep to the sidelines today,” tweeted journalist Howell Davies.“Dula Peep” was the product of US TV personality Wendy Williams, whose mangled attempt to remember the name of the then-fledgling pop star Dua Lipa became a popular internet meme.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The planet can’t support billions of meat-eaters,’ says legendary naturalistThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Sir David Attenborough is urging people to go vegetarian or cut back on meat-eating to save species from dying out and to produce more food.In a new Netflix documentary, A Life On Our Planet, the veteran naturalist says: “We must change our diet. The planet can’t support billions of meat-eaters.“If we had a mostly plant-based diet we could increase the yield of the land,” the Mirror reported him as saying.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“The wilder and more erse, the more effective. We must grow palm and soya on deforested lands. Nature is our biggest ally.”Experts say that using swathes of land to grow feed solely for livestock is wasteful because animals are inefficient converters of calories, and that growing human-edible crops on the land would provide more total food.Sixty scientists sign open letter calling for less meat in schoolsUK’s love of chicken ‘fuelling mass forest loss in South America’David Attenborough’s new series Our Planet is not urgent enoughIndustrial farming ‘is driving the sixth mass extinction of life’Sir David, whose Blue Planet II series prompted widespread efforts to reduce plastic use, also warned that we should make the world wild again to save it.The growth of animal farming worldwide and rise in demand for meat and dairy are considered key factors in deforestation, which is threatening the extinction of many wild species in the food chain, from insects to elephants and big cats.“The true tragedy of our time is still unfolding – the loss of bioersity,” Sir David reportedly says in the film.“Half of fertile land on Earth is now farmland, 70 per cent of birds are domestic, majority chickens. We are one third of animals on Earth. This is now our planet run by – and for – humans.“There’s little left for the world. We have completely destroyed it.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Arctic becomes ice-free, global warming increases, frozen soils release methane and accelerate climate change dramatically.“By 2080 global food production enters crisis, soils overused, weather more unpredictable. The planet becomes four degrees warmer, large parts of the world uninhabitable.“A sixth mass extinction is well under way. Our garden of Eden will be lost. I wish I wasn’t involved in this struggle. I wish I wasn’t there.”Sir David urges the world to restore bioersity and rewild the world, which, he says, would be “easier than you think”.He adds: “Our planet is headed for disaster. We need to learn how to work with nature rather than against it.“Human beings have overrun the world.”Quarter of UK mammals face extinction, first official red list revealsReferring to the loss of wildlife and growth of meat production, he warns: “We’re replacing the wild with the tame,” but says: “If we act now, we can put it right.”In 2017, Sir David revealed that he had stopped eating meat, and last year reportedly said: “I haven’t been a doctrinaire vegetarian or vegan, but I no longer have the same appetite for meat. Why? I’m not sure. I think subconsciously maybe it’s because of the state of the planet.”Peter Stevenson, chief policy adviser of Compassion in World Farming, has reported that: “For every 100 calories fed to animals in the form of human-edible crops, we receive just 17-30 calories in the form of meat and milk.”WWF says the UK food supply alone is directly linked to the extinction of about 33 species at home and abroad.A Life On Our Planet will be in cinemas from 28 September before being released globally on Netflix in the autumn.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There will be trees on houses. There will be houses destroyed. There will be mobile homes turned over.Judge Mark Henry of\u0026nbspGalveston County, Texas, has urged any residents still in the area to evacuate as soon as possible, ahead of hurricane Laura.Mr Henry told CNN that a majority of residents have already left the area, following a mandatory evacuation order, but he warned anyone who has remained that Galveston County could see major destruction tonight and on Thursday.He said:\u0026nbspOur biggest concern is that this is a powerful storm and hurricanes are notorious for making last-minute changes that no one predicted, and we have very little time to react should that happen now.The city evacuated 300 people on Tuesday, but had to stop as the weather worsened, according to CNN.The Calcasieu Parish Sheriff\u0027s Office has evacuated prisoners in the area, in preparation for hurricane Laura.In a Facebook post on Wednesday, the office confirmed that it started evacuating prisoners on Tuesday, and continued today.The Calcasieu Parish Sheriff\u0027s Office began evacuating all prisoners, over 900, due to the threat of hurricane Laura. The prisoners will be housed in various facilities throughout the state and will be brought back as soon as conditions are safe, the Facebook post read.Sheriff Tony Mancuso confirmed that the prison will stay open for anyone who commits a major crime, or engages in looting during the storm.Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards announced at his press conference on Wednesday that the full Louisiana National Guard has been activated, to help deal with hurricane Laura.He added:\u0026nbspWe need everyone in southwest Louisiana paying close attention to this storm.\u0026nbspPeople need to heed the warnings they have been given and evacuate.The governor also said that parts of the state could be unsurvivable, which echoed\u0026nbspthe National Hurricane Centre, which\u0026nbspsaid earlier\u0026nbspthat there will be an unsurvivable storm surge with large and destructive waves will cause catastrophic damage from Sea Rim State Park, Texas, to Intracoastal City, Louisiana, including Calcasieu and Sabine Lakes.It added that only a few hours remain to protect life and property and all actions should be rushed to completion.\u0026nbspDue to Covid-19 concerns, Louisiana officials are transporting residents from coastal areas to hotels, instead of shelters in preparation for hurricane Laura.Mike Steele, Communications Director at Governor\u0027s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness for the State of Louisiana, told CNN: What\u0027s being done on a state level, instead of picking them up and taking them to state operated shelters, they\u0027re being picked up and taken to hotel rooms because of Covid concerns.\u0026nbspHe added that so far, 892 people have been assisted with their evacuation in coordination with the parish and the state.Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh could not confirm whether the third night of\u0026nbspthe Republican National Convention (RNC) would be affected by hurricane Laura, in a call with reporters, including one from CNN.He was also unable to confirm whether Laura would play a part in the messaging at the RNC.I have not seen the final draft of remarks. I know that the President and the White House is of course on top of the situation regarding the storms, he said.And that\u0027s, probably, to talk about moment to moment what is happening there, that\u0027s a question better aimed at the White House.The National Hurricane Centre has warned that hurricane Laura continues to rapidly strengthen and it is expected to become an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane.Laura was upgraded from a Category 1 to a Category 3 hurricane on Wednesday morning, but is continuing to grow on its way to the US coast.The centre added that there is\u0026nbsponly a few hours remain to protect life and property in both Texas and Louisiana.Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards has warned residents in the state that they are only have a few hours to prepare and evacuate before Laura hits its coast.He added: Wherever you are by noon is where you\u0027ll have to ride out the storm. Be smart and be safe.The Louisiana Department of Health also reminded residents to continue with coronavirus precautions during the storm.Wear a mask and keep distance from those outside of your family when possible, the agency tweeted. They urged residents that if they are staying with other people, to talk to them in advance about how can best protect yourself from Covid-19.Forecasters are predicting that Laura will be upgraded from Category 3 to Category 4 before it reaches the US coast later today.Top winds of 130mph are now expected by the time the storm reaches the US coast, and the Hurricane Centre has predicted that it will cause major damage across\u0026nbsp450 miles of coast from Texas to Mississippi.The centre has predicted that\u0026nbsppower outages will last weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn anticipation of the hurricane reaching the US coast on\u0026nbspWednesday,\u0026nbspMore than half a million people were ordered to flee from an area of the Gulf Coast along the Texas-Louisiana state line.Speaking about the possible impact of the hurricane, Kathleen Tierney, former director of the Natural Hazards Centre\u0026nbspat the University of Colorado said: We need to be concerned about the federal capacity to respond to a major hurricane disaster, particularly in light of failings that are all too obvious in the public health area.After 300 rigging platforms were evacuated earlier in the week,\u0026nbsp84 per cent\u0026nbspof Gulf oil production and an estimated 61 per cent\u0026nbspof natural gas production has been shut down, threatening\u0026nbspa centre of the US energy industry.Hurricane Laura was upgraded from a Tropical Storm on Monday night, after it was recorded\u0026nbspmoving at 17 mph with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, while over the Gulf of Mexico.\u0026nbspStates in the Gulf Coast were hit by Tropical Storm Marco on Monday, but it was downgraded to a tropical depression not long after it reached land on Monday.\u0026nbspLaura has already killed nearly two dozen people on the island of Hiiola, including 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic, where it caused intense flooding and destruction.Hurricane Laura is now a major Category 3 storm with winds of 115pmh and gusts close to 130mph, as it barrels towards the Gulf Coast ahead of landfall tonight.It is forecast to rapidly power up into a catastrophic Category 4 hurricane later today, intensifying as it churns towards Texas and Louisiana where it\u0027s expected to make landfall just after midnight.Hurricane Laura upgraded to major Category 3 stormNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The latest obstacles to learning come from Unison demanding more money for cleaning and masks for teachers before it will agree to theto school.Wouldn’t they — and flip-flopping Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer — enjoy the Government’s discomfortthey turn the start of the new term into another education fiasco Andchildren’s futures are blighted in the process, so what That’s a risk the militants seem only too happy to take.THE spate of illegal parties being broken up by police is shockingly predictable.Young adults happy to binge on dubious Class A drugs and toxic quantities of alcohol are hardly likely to bother too much about social distancing.Meanwhile, sensibly-controlled pubs and restaurants face ato lockdownCovid infections rise when the real culprits are those spreading the disease at unregulated gatherings.The deadly threat that partygoers pose to the elderly or vulnerable clearly doesn’t bother them when they selfishly suppose they won’t be badly affectedthey catch Covid.Raving idiots.THE BBC is set to drop crowd favourites Land of Hope and Glory and Rule, Britannia from the Last Night of The Proms in solidarity with Black Lives Matter.They think the perfect time to make the change is in the absence of a passionate audience who have cared deeply about these songs — symbols of our national pride — for more than  years.The trouble is, there are too many at the Beeb who just don’t like patriotism. Or Britain. Or their audience.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Usually there is at least a soloist,not a full choir leading the audience, but of course this year the public seats in the hall will be empty because of the virus, and the voices on stage silenced.Now, the lyrics of both songs are pro-colonial. If you ban them from the Last Night of the Proms, ending a tradition going back decades, what consequences will that have Certainly, someone  years from now will say we shouldn’t have done that.It is the same argument for not taking down statues. If you remove statues because that person stands for something evil in their past, you are removing the deed too.Manipulating history only adds to mistrust among the black community.I would like to see the survey that says the public want these two songs taken out of the Proms programme, because it appears to me that the public hasn’t been consulted.Rule, Britannia! was written by Scottish poet James Thomson and he features on the famous Scott Monument in Edinburgh, near where I live.He is also commemorated in Westminster Abbey’s Poets’ Corner, next to William Shakespeare.If we say we must remove his words from the Proms, do we then remove the memorials too Rule, Britannia!, written and set to music in , was mentioned in James Joyce’s novel, Ulysses. It is part of my history and my culture. If we take it away, we take away part of my culture.It’s a song about the power structure at the time, and the arrogance and hypocrisy of Britain vowing to “never be slaves” while at the same time owning and benefiting from about , black chattel slaves in the West Indies who were called ‘property’.Of course, people are sensitive to its meaning, as well as Land Of Hope And Glory, the music of which was written by Edward Elgar.It doesn’t mean we should hide it.I personally don’t find the lyrics offensive because they are a true representation of the terrible truth at the time.If you take that away, then you are replacing history with a fairy story.There is also the possibility that it was written to show the evil of the time, rather than glorying it.The objection is that Rule, Britannia! is used by flag-waving “prommers” as a jubilant finale at the Proms.It is used in the wrong context, and that is part of the ignorance of our society of our history.It’s the same with Amazing Grace, which was written by a slaver of black people and is sung as a religious anthem.Recently, it was proposed that we should ban Swing Low, Sweet Chariot at rugby matches due to its link to slavery. That came to nothing.Instead of banning such songs or stripping away their lyrics, we need to educate people on the history of slavery, starting with putting it on the history curriculum.From speaking to people about slavery, the one constant reaction is always: “Why didn’t anyone tell us this before ”At the Proms, instead of taking the words away, we should put an explanation in the programme. We should tell people it’s about enslaving black people, making money from them, giving them a short le span and then compensating the slave owners when it was abolished because slaves were regarded as ‘property’.If they want to sing it after reading that, then fine, go ahead and sing it. But I bet they won’t sing it as joyfully as they might have done before.When I worked in research, I once had a lovely technician who worked for me. She looked after me so well, and she went to the Proms.If she knew the history of those two songs, being my friend, I doubt she would have sung along.It wasn’t her fault that she didn’t know the history.Those songs didn’t have a place in the Proms in the first place, they are there because of people’s ignorance. I would challenge anyone to know their meanings and still sing them in a frivolous capacity.But we shouldn’t be bothering ourselves about whether those songs should now be removed.What we should be bothering ourselves about is increasing the representation of black people who are the descendants of slaves. We should be concerning ourselves about making sure black people from the Windrush generation get compensation. And we should also be ensuring ourselves that every child is taught the history of slavery so that they can make their own minds up about whether to sing songs like these.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At last, after an unprecedented lockdown of six months, all schools are due to re-open, representing a giant leap back towards normality. But the damage caused by the Coronavirus disruption has been severe.Many parents have been prevented from ing to work. Young people’s education has been badly undermined, especially because the quality of online learning has been so uneven. One study found that a fth of pupils had less than an hour’s instruction a day. Moreover, social activities and friendships – which are a vital part of growing up – have been heavily restricted.The exam chaos over the last fortnight was a fitting symbol of the vacuum created by the absence of proper schooling. No advanced society canwhen a vital sector like education is temporarily paralysed. That is why it is so important that the Government succeeds in its goal of seeing a fullto the classroom. As Boris Johnson put it at the weekend, “it is vital for pupils’ education. It is vital for their welfare. It’s vital for their physical and, indeed, mental well-being.”Given the Government’s mixed record on its management of the Covid crisis, this will be a big test. From the inadequate supply of protective gear to the botched imposition of quarantine rules, Ministers have got it badly wrong at times. They cannot afford another fiasco next week.But to do that, they will have to curtail the influence of militant teaching unions, which thrive in a climate of scare-mongering and grievance. Full of negativity, these hardened left-wing operators turn every pebble of dficulty into a giant boulder of obstruction. They are the abominable no men and women, the ultimate “can’t do” brigade.To overcome the unions’ capacity for trouble-making, reassurances about safety will be absolutely crucial. Most teachers are keen to go back to work, but they want to know schools will not be dangerous environments. That is why the recent upbeat advice from medical experts has been so welcome. It is clear from the Covid experience around the world that not only are children less likely to transmit the disease than any other group, but also that schools are safer than most other workplaces. Yesterday, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries pointed out that a child is more likely to be involved in a traffic accident or die from flu than to be harmed by Coronavirus.That message was also spelt out by her boss Chris Whitty, who said on Sunday that the damage to health caused by a continued schools lockdown is potentially greater than the impact of Covid. “The balance of risk is very strongly in favour of children going to school,” he declared, adding the chances of catching the disease “are incredibly small.” In fact, there is now hard evidence to prove this. Although the vast majority of schools were closed since March, over one million pupils – such as the children of essential workers – went back to the classroom in June. Yet a comprehensive study by Public Health England showed that in the subsequent weeks until the end of term, just  children and  staff tested positive for Covid- – and nearly all these infections occurred outside the school. There were hardly any cases of children passing on the disease to each other, or to their teachers. Other research from around the world has come to the same conclusion.But none of this seems to matter to the teaching unions, eager to exploit anxiety in pursuit of their anti-Tory agenda. These are the organisations which for decades have blocked every major reform of the education system and have defended every outdated working practice. With depressing inevitability, they have continually put their own narrow interests before the wider needs of pupils. They want the respect due to trained professionals but they frequently display the rebellious spirit of the permanent agitators. “Strike action is a very powerful tool,” said Amanda Martin, the President of the ,-strong National Education Unionin an interview with the Communist Morning Star newspaper in , adding, “I’ve run demos and rallies and worked with trade councils to bring everyone out and that’s brilliant.”Led by the NEU, the unions have brought the same attitude to the Coronavirus crisis. Instead of looking for solutions, they have endlessly exaggerated problems. One Whitehall insider says of Dr Mary Bousted, the £,-a-year joint general secretary of the NEU, “it’s all about the union, to hell with the teachers who want to get back into the classroom – let alone the children.” A left-wing radical, Bousted jokes that the word “strike” was one of the first she learnt as a child. Hers is not the voice of co-operation and enterprise, so it is hardly surprising that the Government has struggled to get schools reopened.In June, a planned majorwas thwarted by the unions, dealing a severe blow to Gavin Williamson’s credibility. One left-wing website gushed that the continued shutdown was due “to the hard work of NEU branch secretaries and rank and file militants galvanising the members.” In the months since, an alliance of unions – including Bousted’s NEU and Unite led by the notorious Merseyside militant Len McCluskey – have fought a y battle against a swt re-opening. Central to this effort at sabotage was a vast -point checklist of detailed questions which the Department for Education was told it had to answer. Dubbed by critics “a wreckers’ charter”, the list included queries such as “will lidded bins with double bagging be available in every classroom”, “will dedicated space be available for any breastfeeding women to express milk” and “has behaviour policy been reviewed to acknowledge the increased level of trauma and anxiety experienced by pupils ” Some Tories complained that the union was playing politics. Robert Halfon, the chairman of the Education Select Committee was amazed at the warped priorities: “It is incredible that not one of these nit-picking questions asks the most important thing of all – what’s best for the kids ”Even as September approaches, the whining and resistance has not ceased. “The unions need to stand firm and protect their members,” argues socialist teacher Martin Powell-Davies. In the latest ruse, the public sector outfit UNISON not only wants its members to wear masks in the classroom – something for which there is no scientic evidence of any need – but also to have extra funding for deep cleaning. “Schools need more money to pay for specially trained cleaners, rather than relying on other staff who are busy enough already,” says Jon Richards, UNISON’s head of education. The moan about over-stretched budgets is a favourite of the union movement but it is an empty accusation. The Government is pouring an extra £. billion into education, while this summer it was announced that teachers’ pay is to go up by an average of . per cent, a bigger increase than any other public sector workers received.But that did nothing to stop the combination of whingeing and shroud-waving. The mentality of the hardliners was embodied in a recent statement from the NEU’s far left “Education Solidarity Network” which set out a series of demands to “make sure safety comes first.” Among them were: “smaller class sizes to allow adequate physical distancing” arrangements “for rotas and home learning to be produced in consultation with parents” “local risk assessments to include staggered outdoor breaks, sanitising, provision of transparent coverings to enable access to lip reading and facial expression” and “weekly onsite testing of staff”. Above all, the Network called for extra funding “to implement these measures.” If there were any question of a risk to safety, the union should “prepare for a national strike ballot.”That was so typical. This lot seem to feel more comfortable on the picket line than in the classroom. The Solidary Network might be seen as extreme, but its carping outlook runs right through the unionYesterday, the NEU’s joint general secretary was bleating on the airwaves about the risks of new Covid spikes: “Staff, parents and pupils are being sorely let down by the government because of a lack of a Plan B and of ensuring robust track and trace is in place throughout the country. We believe the Government is negligent in the extreme.” The charge of negligence might be applied with more force to the NEU, whose hostile stance has made thesuch an exhausting obstacle course. The militants cannot be allowed to prevail next week.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its just not realistic.#If you look at some of the greatest competitors in the world and winners in every sport, they are not always easy to manage and they are not perfect.

Pictured is, apparently, a pair of “size ” jeans from online giant Asosin front of my old size sI couldn’t get them up one leg and, quite frankly, Kate Moss would struggle too. So they’re going back.Then a beguiling ad for summer dresses popped up on my Instagram account and I clicked through to a site called “Cinderear” showing a wide range of very pretty frocks on tanned and shapely models.I ordered what was described as a “Printed Folding Holiday Swing Dress” in what looked like an airy cotton, cinched in at the waist with a brown leather belt. The colour was described as apricot.What arrived — several weeks later — was a beyond-hideous sartorial aberration that was “Made in China” , out of a paper-thin polyester that would make me think twice about standing near a naked flame.What’s more, the colour was more camel and blue than “apricot”, it swamped me, and the brown belt in the photo was nowhere to be seen.It cost me  — approx £ — and the s policy is so ­unintelligible that it’s not worth the bother. More fool me.Buying a bookshelf or bog brush online is fine, but clothes is another matter. I like to feel the fabric and see the fit.So a couple of weeks ago, I masked up and ventured out on a shopping trip to West London’s vast Westfield where I felt like a ­Hollywood superstar having a ­personal shopping experience. It was am on a Monday morning and virtually empty.Little wonder when the ­government guidance says retailers must “discourage customers from handling products while browsing, and keep fitting rooms closed”.One store let me try on a dress then sanitised the cubicle afterwards, another told me thatI tried something on they would have to then take it off display for  hours.In LK Bennett, the fitting rooms were closed and I askedI could try on a blouse over my clothes, just to seeit actually fits. No, they said, you have to buy the item, take it home to try it on, then bring it backit doesn’t fit. Needless to say, I ed home empty-handed.So,our High Street clothes shops are to survive the pandemic, two things need to happen.Unless classed as vulnerable, those of us who actually enjoy clothes ­shopping need to get back out there as soon as possible and actively support them. And the Government needs to relax its strict rules and let retailers and shoppers take inidual responsibility for what happens in store.If I have to wear a mask and gloves to try on a pair of jeans in a cubicle, then I’m happy to do so. I’ll even wipe it down afterwards with my newly repurposed “apricot” dress.SPORTED by the likes of Chris Waddle back in the day, the mullet is apparently enjoying a resurgence during the pandemic.Oh dear.

Ive just killed somebody, the gunman said on a video posted online.The lead up to the fatal shooting isnt clear but police think it may have resulted from a gas station cojnflict.Cops said self-styled militias were defending local businesses from looters but the sherf didnt confirm that the gunman was one of the armed citizens patrolling the streets. Koerri Elijah told Insider that the teenager, later identied as Rittenhouse by cops, appeared to be on edge before he ran past him and shots rang out. I noticed him the entire time. He didnt seem like he was there with anyone, Elijah said. He was armed. He didnt seem like he was a threat, but I thought maybe I should keep an eye on him.Hours before he was identied as a suspect, social media sleuths named the teen boy and posted his picture online. Last night, the first shots were fired just after midnight, as a group of protesters faced off police in riot trucks on Sheridan Road.People were then seen chasing the man before another round of rapid-fire shots were heard.

And everyone is trying to fight the guy, chasing him, and then he started shooting again.Scott said he hit the ground during the next burst of gunfire, then tried to aid a person who was lying prone in the street.He added: I was cradling him in my arms. I was trying to keep this kid alive and he wasnt moving or nothing. He was just laying there.Carol Badoni, from Burlington, Wisonsin, spoke to the girlfriend of one of the victims, she said his name was Ben Wis. Carol, , said: “He definitely was not breathing,” “His eyes were rolled back in his head. There was no pulse.”But she added that she saw no blood,before cops arrived and took Ben to hospital.In another clip, a man was seen removing his top to help another victim of the shooting.Meanwhile, other protests erupted across the country in response to the shooting.Police in Portland, Oregon, also declared a gathering of hundreds of anti-racism protesters outside City Hall as a riot, ordering the crowd to disperse or face arrest.People at the Kenosha protest were heard shouting: Theres people getting shot everywhere.Kenosha has been riddled with violence, looting, criminal damage and fires in response to the death of Jacob Blake, a -year-old black man who was shot by police.

Seven exit ramps were closed from Interstate- from the Illinois border to Racine, Wis. which is about  minutes north of Kenosha.In downtown Kenosha, a huge crowd of protesters gathered around the barrier at Kenosha County Courthouse. One protester, Nathan, , who didnt want to give his full name said: A lot of fear in the air because of threats to protesters. “I worry a lot about the misinformation,” he said after explaining he didnt think national movement to bring greater police accountability will lead to real change. Although, he said locally, his city will never be the same.“It’s hard to see now, but it will be a positive thing,” he said of the protests. “It’ll bring Kenosha back together.

Lord Grade told the Today programme that the BBC had prove they are out of touch with the rest of the country, they have shown that time and again with Brexit coverage. They missed the big swing at the election and they are too trapped in the Westminster Bubble”, he added.“The big question is what is the future for public sector broadcasting  And he urged BBC bosses to have a long hard look and come up with a role for the BBC... which hasn’t changed in  years.”And on the proms row he added it’s “clearly a mistake, it’s just idiotic.”  Boris Johnson entered the fray over Proms yesterday by blasting the cringing embarrassment over Britains history.He said yesterday: I think its time we stopped our cringing embarrassment about our history, about our traditions, and about our culture, and we stopped this general fight of self-recrimination and wetness, I wanted to get that off my chest.It is clear from its news, its commentary, its dramas and its dismal, lazy comedy that it despises the voting majority which — to the out-of-touch corporation’s disbelief — repeatedly backed both Brexit and the Tories.Its decision now to censor Rule, ­Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory ought to be the last straw.Boris Johnson has rightly joined many others in condemning it. And though it is not for the PM to decide the BBC’s output, his Government can and should end its publicly funded financial model.The Beeb could turn this around. It just doesn’t want to. It dislikes much about Britain and is ashamed of our past.Its woke staff are interested only in causes and ideas beloved of middle-class metropolitan Remainer graduates like them. Mainstream views shared by the ordinary majority, older Conservative voters in particular, are held in contemptthey are considered at all.So Tories, who won a huge election mandate only months ago, are treated with cynical disdain. Meanwhile ­left-wing activists are routinely given s on news programmes where they masquerade as “ordinary people” or even Newsnight journalists.The BBC has destroyed the case for its licence fee. It’s time the Government stopped griping about it and took action.But the BBC said the songs would be sung next year - and said the decision to cut the lyrics was over fears of a second wave of coronavirus. A spokesman for the BBC said: “For the avoidance of any doubt, these songs will be sung next year.“We obviously share the disappointment of everyone that the Proms will have to be dferent but believe this is the best solution in the circumstances and look forward to their traditionalnext year.”Outgoing director-general of the BBC, Lord Tony Hall, has said the decision to remove the lyrics was a creative one, but said the issue of the songs association with colonial history had been discussed. He saidsaid it was a miracle that Proms boss David Pickard had put together a fortnight of live performances amid the pandemic.When askedthe songs links to colonial history had been discussed, Lord Hall said: The whole thing has been discussed by David and his colleagues, of course it has.The point is theyve come to the right conclusion, which is its very, very hard in an Albert Hall that takes over , people to have the atmosphere of the Last Night Of The Proms, where a whole audience normally sing along, he told the BBCs media editor.Its quite hard creatively and artistically to make that work.

Ultimately we aim to make a vaccine that will not only protect from Sars-CoV-, but other related coronaviruses that may spill over from animals to humans.”  He added that manufacturing of the vaccine should be cheap and said that it does not need to be refrigerated.This means that the vaccine will also be accessible to people in hotter countries.Prof Heeney said it’s unlikely that the new vaccine will trigger a bad immune response.The first trials will take place at the National Institute for Health Research Southampton Clinical Research Facility at University Hospital Southampton.Director of the facility, Professor Saul Faust said: “It is critical that dferent vaccine technologies are tested as at this stage no one can be sure which type of vaccine will produce the best and most long-lived immune responses.”It comes just days after Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty said he would be surpriseda vaccine was available before .The daily increase in fatalities and cases across the UK has continued to slow this month however health authorities are on high alert for any spike in the deadly bug.Prof Whitty today said he would be delighteda vaccine came early.But the CMO said: I’d be quite surprisedwe had a highly effective vaccine ready for mass use in a large percentage of the population before the end of winter, certainly before this side of Christmas.”He added: I think it is unlikely we will have a vaccine that is highly effective and ready to deploy at scale this winter meaning  .I think there is a reasonable chance that we will have vaccines, not a certainty, in the period before the following winter of  .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This shouldnapost be necessary to say, because we all had history lessons and we were awake for some of them. But Britannia has never ruled the waves.We had officially-approved pirates who stole gold from the Spanish and started the slave trade. We had glorious navies that had a habit of sinking, we dodged U-boats, we provided the first circumnavigation of the globe, and the first man to do it alone. But we also had a king who told the waves to go away, and collective amnesia about the point he was trying to make.King Cnut did not get his feet wet in the th century just so he could be a cipher for a swearword on Twitter , years later. He tried to rule the waves in order to prove that, despite being a warrior king with  North Sea countries beneath his heel, waves do their own thing. Britannia was around before him, was revived as a bit of Elizabethan militarist propaganda, and in  got nicked by a prince who wanted a song to impress his dad, George II. At the time, our ruling of the waves was centred on what became known as the War of Jenkinsapos Ear, about slave trading rights. We lost. The Prime Minister, who likes to give the impression he knows more history than anyone , must know that Rule Britannia is a silly song. He must, surely, realise that these islands did not pop up from an azure main, has noangels, and especially that not only has it got one of the smallest navies of all time, but is about to have a cavalry without any tanks.He probably does think, as verse  does, that foreign nations must, in their turn, to tyrants fall, that we are the envy of them all and our cities shall with commerce shine as verse  proclaims. But itaposs bollocks. Mainly because anything you tell George II in  to keep him happy is bound to be, but also because Boris Johnson has put this country on a course to - let me just check this official government document - ah yes, complete economic and social meltdown. That is no reason for the PM not to make a fuss about the BBC being too wet to let us sing a jaunty tune. Because otherwise we might notice that Dominic Cummings has given £m in uncontested government contracts to his mates, that a misogynist Aussie with no business experience has been put in charge of our Brexit trade deals, and that heaposs u-turned so often the PM is technically doing doughnuts in Downing Street. Of all the things that should be making anyone, of any political bent or age or race, steaming mad today, the fact that an empty Albert Hall will not be shaken to the rafters by , people who only know the chorus anyway is the very least of them.Get angry about Cummings gting a total of £m in contracts to colleagues and friends to find out what the public think of the government, when he could ask his neighbours for free.Fret, why donapost you, about how a shadowy group of Right-wing conspiracy theorists who claim to be protecting children marched on Buckingham Palace to shout paedophile! at Prince Andrew, despite the fact not a single Royal was in residence and the crimes he is accused of, while heinous, do not include paedophilia. Such stupidity is expected, by Brits, in other countries - itaposs pretty worrying to see it manest in The Mall.Or you could be infuriated by shame at the country being run by people who genuinely believe the Board of Trade should be graced by a man of without business experience, but who sent refugee children to sicken and starve on a Pacic island and whose reputation, such as it is, was savaged in the most devastating political speech Australia has ever witnessed.  Second thoughts, letaposs not. Merely boiling with fury does not seem to change much. If it did, Piers Morgan would be God.Letaposs ask ourselves, instead, whether to mask, or not to mask that is the question. Whether apostis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of these absolute cockwhistles, or to take arms against a sea of troublesome twits, and by opposing, end them.Letaposs remind ourselves that weaposre arguing about masks only because incompetents who have spent decades arguing about bendy bananas and how many children theyaposre responsible for are now in charge of keeping us safe, and are arguing about that, too.

Ministers had insisted there would be no recommendation for children to wear face coverings in communal areas, and said the scientic evidence backed them up. But late last night, after the Scottish Government had issued obligatory guidance that pupils should wear face coverings when moving around schools from Monday, the Department for Education issued a change in advice. But what are the new rules  When and where will children have to wear masks - and will it apply to all schools  Hereaposs everything you need to know about the new changes. What measures are being introduced in England  From September , and in secondary schools in England that are within areas under local restrictions, face coverings should be worn when moving around corridors and communal spaces. This does not include classrooms and does not apply to primary-aged pupils. Why are face coverings not required in classrooms   Guidance from the Department for Educationsays that it will not usually be necessary in classrooms, as protective measures mean the risks are lower - such as grouping staff and students in bubbles. Face coverings can have a negative impact on learning and teaching and so their use in lessons should be avoided, it adds.So in which areas should face coverings be worn in secondary schools  Additional precautionary measures apply to places defined as areas of national Government intervention, as listed on the gov.uk website, according to the guidance. Local restrictions are currently in place in areas of Greater Manchester, Lancashire, and West Yorkshire, Leicester, Luton and Northampton. Can schools recommend face coveringsthey are where in England  Schools and colleges outside of local lockdown areas will have the discretion to require face coverings in communal areas where social distancing cannot be safely managed, the guidance says. It gives the example of a school or college which has a layout that makes it particularly dficult for people to stay apart. Are there any exemptions  Yes. Those who cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or impairment, or disability, will be exempt. Guidance says that exemptions also apply to people who provide assistance to someone who relies on lip-reading, clear sound or facial expression to communicate. Could the measures be changed further  Education Secretary Gavin Williamson ruled out the requirements for face coverings in Englandaposs schools being extended further. When askedthe measures could be extended, he told the BBC: No, no, thereaposs no intention of extending it beyond that because as bothsaid andsaid is that actually that isnapost what is required. What has the Scottish Government announced on face coverings  Face coverings should be worn by staff and pupils when moving around secondary schools in Scotland from August , according to Holyroodaposs Education Secretary. John Swinney said that the rule will apply on school transport for primary school pupils aged five and above, and all those at secondary school in communal areas, but not in classrooms.

Town hall leaders told a cross-party group of MPs and peers that experts on the ground knew their areas better than London-based chiefs.Giving evidence to the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, the Local Government Associationaposs Ian Hudspeth said: “Local is good.“As we move into the next phase, the urge is to say to Government – aposTrust local councils to deliver, we are ready and able and know our areas.

Give us some space and give us responsibility – and, of course, the fundingapos.” Leicester mayor Sir Peter Soulsby, who leads the first UK city put into a local lockdown, said: “We know our localities, we know our people, we know our neighbourhoods and we know our communities. “One of my regrets is that the Government has been perhaps insufficiently trusting of us in the knowledge of our localities and our ability to put people on the ground knowing what they are doing.” He blasted Whitehall for “not trusting us with the data and not trusting us with the powers” which “very signicantly hindered our ability to respond as effectively as we would wish to and as we could”.Speaking of a “fundamental frustration” and “handicap” among local authoritiesapos experts, former Labour MP Sir Peter went on: “Directors of public health day-to-day have felt that they have not had the data that they need from central government – even now, the data that they need from central government, from the testing regime, that enables them to use their people and their skills at a local level effectively.” Public health registrar Dr Isobel Braithwaite told the group the statistics for national and local contact tracing teams speak for themselves.

The scaffolding supervisor has terminal cancer after a potentially le-saving operation was cancelled because of Covid. Our hearts go out to Adrian and his family. What makes this all the more unbearable is it will not be an isolated case. Cancer Research fears a third of cancer patients have missed vital treatment because of the pandemic. The number of urgent cancer referrals by GPs in England fell by a half in May and there are more than two million people waiting for breast, bowel and cervical cancer screenings. We cannot allow the legacy of lockdown to be thousands of lives lost to other diseases. The same spirit of endeavour which saw the building of the Nightingale hospitals should now be applied to clearing this backlog and restoring all NHS services. Lives depend on it. Your turn Gav OFQUAL chief Sally Collier today put Gavin Williamson to shame by resigning over the exams fiasco. In a more honourable world it would be the Education Secretary who handed in his notice. Yet can again we are seeing civil servants being made scapegoats for failings by arrogant and incompetent Conservative ministers. Mr Williamson has been promoted way beyond his ability. Not only has he presided over the exam grading fiasco he has failed to set out a clear plan for schools to reopen. The confusion over whether pupils should wear face coverings has added to the chaos. At the same time figures show the gap between the richest and poorest pupils is rising. If Boris Johnson really cared about children’s schooling he would install a new Education Secretary capable of sorting out this mess. It’s Santatiser!

Michelle Tomlinson turned to the media after she and husband Ashley were separated when he flew to Yorkshire from Australia to be by his dying dadaposs bedside - and was told he could not fly back.It was only after reporters from Australiaaposs News had contacted the Australian Border Forcethat Ashley was given an exemption - but Michelle had already resigned from work and packed up their Perth home ready to leave for the UK to be reunited with her husband.Ashley flew to the UK to say goodbye to his dying dad Owen in March - just as Australia closed its borders to all but citizens and permanent residents. His dad died from cancer a week later. Nurse Michelle and prison officer Ashley have lived in Australia for almost eight years on a skilled visa, News reports. This meant he was barred from reentering the country, but Ashley was hopeful he would be allowed back home. Ashley booked a flight the day after the announcement but he was not allowed to fly. He put his first appeal for a travel exemption in as he sat at Manchester Airport waiting for his flight. In all, the couple has had seven applications to the ABF rejected. Michelle was set to fly out to Yorkshire yesterday, and said she felt they had been treated cruelly by the Australian government. She told news: I feel really let down. We have lived here coming up to eight years. We have paid our taxes. We have both been working full time. We have contributed to the Australian economy, and nobody seems to care. Itaposs almost like youaposre not permanent residents so you donapost matter. But after the Australian media site approached the ABF for comment, Michelle received a notication hours later from the Department of Home Affairs that Ashleyaposs travel exemption had been approved.  Michelle said the couple have been left in absolute turmoil...somewhere between angry and destroyed right now. The exemption seems to have come to late, and Michelle claims to have spent , shipping belongings to the UK and buying flights for herself, two dogs and three cats. Michelle said the trauma could have been avoidedthe exemption had been granted a fortnight earlier - and suspects the authorities did not make the decision out of compassion, but for fear of bad press. She says the exemption has been granted on the same appeal they made previously - which was rejected at the time as they were not deemed to have met the criteria.

We know that some of these young people had no symptoms, and so carried on as normal, including a night out in Plymouth’s bars and restaurants, until they became aware of the risk.  That means more people could be infected. While young people might have fairly mild symptoms, and sometimes none that you would notice, our big concern is that we know it can be very serious for people who have existing health problems or are older. “We are in contact with all the pubs and bars across the city to remind them of their front line role in stopping the spread of this virus. They need to help us to protect the city. But it also needs everyone to help too. If you think you’ve been in contact with someone who has tested positive, you need to stay at home.

A number of stars will forgo the filter and share images featuring their scars, stretch marks and other so-called aposimperfectionsapos. TV personality and mum-of-three Stacey Solomon, who often shares images of her stretch marks on social media, is working with the skincare brand. She said: No matter how hard society or social media tries to tell us that we are not enough, womenaposs bodies are incredible and should be celebrated. I love my stretch marks, every inch of my body is part of my story, as a woman and as a mother, I wouldnapost change an inch.  This is why Iaposm championing Doveaposs campaign to share and celebrate my skin, stretch-marked and dimpled, to encourage other women to embrace the stories their own skin tells. Over the past few years, Iaposve learned to embrace and love the body that I live in and I know that seeing other womenaposs real bodies is so empowering. Iaposm going to keep sharing images of my skin, unfiltered, and hope other women will join me.  The research also revealed a thirdof women described their skin as aposblemishedapos,  per cent said itaposs apossaggyapos - and more than one in even went as far as to say itaposs aposuglyapos. Almost a quarter felt their skin would be aposmore beautulapos without the perceived imperfections such as cellulite, scars, and stretch-marks. And  per cent of women believed social media sets unrealistic expectations of what skin should look like, according to the OnePoll survey.  As a result,  per cent want to see more people posting unedited and unfiltered images of themselves, with  per cent believing it would help them feel less pressure to have aposperfect skinapos. When it comes to looking after their skin, it also emerged  per cent of women prefer to use personal care products that are formulated specically for their needs. However, almost three quartersbelieve personalised skincare products are too expensive.

Katie says the caravan could do with a full set of new carpets and a good bleach clean throughout, but does come with a pretty decent microwave from Morrisons.

Stephanie Walker says thereaposs a stigma attached to teenage mothers and believes thereaposs an expectation they canapost achieve anything. But Stephanie, who fell pregnant with Daniel at  while studying for her GCSEs, hopes her story will inspire others. Stephanie had struggled with her GCSEs - achieving four Es, four Ds and one C - as she looked after her little bump. But amazingly, she managed to retake her GCSEs at Newcastle College before going to Tyne politan College and Northumbria University. The newly qualied midwe, , graduated from a Midwery Studies course at Northumbria on Sunday - where she delivered nearly  babies in three years. She says she got distinctions in every subject during her midwery course. Stephanie is now doing shts with the same midwe, Joyce, who helped her own teen pregnancy. An emotional Stephanie said: “It’s so brilliant and a relief to pass my course. “I can’t believe I’ve done it. “We haven’t celebrated yet, so we’re going to try and organise a socially distanced garden graduation as it’s been postponed until next July. “I’ve had some great support from my parents who were foster carers. They’ve looked in, supported me and my partner James, and made sure we can attend everything that’s assigned to me. “I never had a career - and had every potential to stay at home to raise my children. “But I knew I had to get back into it and make something of myself. I hope I can inspire other women. “Especially as there’s such a stigma attached to teenage mums. We’re expected to never achieve anything.”  Stephanie, who has gone on to have Isaac, seven, and Freddy, six, started a Health and Social Care Course at Newcastle College straight after school. “They weren’t the GCSEs I needed. I think as soon as I found out that I was pregnant, that was when I started putting in more effort with school. But I think it was too late at that point and I was too distracted.” Determined to pursue midwery, she slaved away doing the Access to Health night course at Tyne politan College for more than two years.  She volunteered as a breastfeeding supporter and ran a group for new mums during her pregnancy - to help secure her university place. And in , a -year-old Stephanie embarked on the specialised subject at Northumbria University. But the mum revealed that it was tough to navigate school lessons and breastfeeding - and the expectations of her classmates. “People would always say ‘ooh are you having a baby ’ or ‘what would your mum say ’ “It wasnapost a thing to be celebrated so it was a shame. It was quite an adverse thing to think about. “I didnapost think I could breastfeed because I was so young. But I started to express during lessons. I would go and hide out in a little office space every three hours.  “I wasnapost a confident breastfeeder at the time. I was so immature. “Luckily I was able to store my milk and bring it home. “It was really lonely because no one understood what I was going through. I was having to wear breast pads and stuff like that. “Nobody can relate to you at all.” Meanwhile her father was struggling to adapt to his daughter’s new look at home - and spent three months trying to wrap his head around it.  “He was a man of few words at the start. It took him a few months to adjust to the fact I was pregnant”, she admitted. “I certainly didn’t celebrate my baby boy throughout the pregnancy. “I do feel like I shamed my family a bit, so I certainly hid my bump a lot. Eventually everyone got used to it after the scan. “It certainly didnapost resonate and I couldnapost quite picture myself with a baby. I didn’t know anyone with a baby so didnapost really know what it was like.  And she only celebrated little Daniel after his birth - taking him to pick up her GCSEs and showing him off. Stephanie’s mum Jude would help her with night feeds and make sure she got out of bed every morning. “My mum would let me socialise, which was really important for my mental health. “I did suffer with postnatal depression - and took some time to adapt. I was lonely postnatally. I would say that I definitely struggled initially.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uber eats deliveroo rival drivers","story":"NewsUber Eats and Deliveroo rival drivers caught on dashcam fighting after crashFootage recorded by a driver who witnessed the motorcycle crash on the junction in the middle of Gallowgate, Newcastle, at about .pm MondayShareByKieran Murray:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video uber-eats-deliveroo-drivers-fight-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,loginRadiusAPIKey:d-da-d--ccee,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,loginRadius:true,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,enableAboutTopics:true,GDPRConsentEnabled:,viafouraComments:true,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,LoginRadiusDomain:https:reachplc.hub.loginradius,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,loginRadiusAPIKey:d-da-d--ccee,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,loginRadius:true,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,enableAboutTopics:true,GDPRConsentEnabled:,viafouraComments:true,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,LoginRadiusDomain:https:reachplc.hub.loginradius,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news uber-eats-deliveroo-rival-drivers-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

All was going swimmingly, until the man called the -year-old upstairs to look at something rather unusual heaposd stumbled across in the attic.The mum-of-one was mortied when he showed her a scaly and rotten sex toy which had been left standing upright in the loft.Raychel was quick to explain that the item didnapost belong to her, or her partner Matthew. Instead she believes it was left there by the former tenants of the property - as neighbouraposs said they were known for their noisy sex sessions. Despite living in the house for a few years, this was the first time Raychel had ever been up into the loft, so she had no idea what was waiting for her up there.

The toy is rotten - it looks like itaposs been there years. Itaposs scaly and scabby at the bottom, like the plastic has burned. She continued: The CCTV man came and said he needed to put a socket in the attic.I just said aposyouaposll have to excuse whateveraposs in the loft because Iaposve never been inapos. I never even went into the attic at all. As he got up the ladders he said aposyour last tenants have left you a little present - go up and have a lookapos.

Melanie Wolfson, , claims she was made to move seats so the father and son did not have to sit next to a woman. She is suing the budget airline for , shekelsin compensation for the flight from London to Tel Aviv, according to a suit filed last week on her behalf. The plaintf, a professional fundraiser, is demanding that the airline change its guidelines for flight crew to prohibit them from asking women to switch seats because of their gender. In response easyJet have said they aposdo not discriminate on any groundsapos. According to Haaretz, Ms Wolfson wants female passengers to be allowed to defend their rights to sit in their assigned seats. EasyJet is one of a handful of airlines that flies direct from London to trendy culture and nightle tourism hot-spot Tel Aviv. The newspaper reports that the suit says the incident took place on October , , and was the first of two similar encounters she claims took place on easyJet trips. Ms Wolfson claims she had already paid extra to book an aisle seat when she found an ultra-Orthodox man and his son sitting in the row when she arrived. As soon as she sat down, the son reportedly got out of his seat and climbed over to the row behind the seats, presumably to avoid physical contact with her for religious reasons. The son then proceeded to look for a male passenger who would be willing to change seats with her, despite Ms Wolfson preferring to stay put.  The suit claims a few minutes later, he ed, and the father asked her to switch seats with a man a few rows ahead of the trio. Ms Wolfson claims the flight attendants offered her a free hot drink to move seats and explained to her that it was common for flight attendants to ask female passengers to move to accommodate ultra-Orthodox males. She also claims the flight attendants encouraged her to complain to the airline in the hope that it could force a change in the controversial policy. Ms Wolfson said she made it clear she was not impressed but ended up moving because she didnapost want to hold up the entire flight. But she said she felt “insulted and humiliated” by the request that she move. “It was the first time in my adult le that I was discriminated against for being a woman,” she told Haaretz. “I would not have had any problem whatsoever switching seatsit were to allow members of a family or friends to sit together, but the fact that I was being asked to do this because I was a woman was why I refused.”  She added: “What was even more infuriating was that there were passengers watching this happen who said nothing. She said she filed a formal complaint against easyJet about a month after the flight. She based the complaint over the claimed demand by staff that she move seats because of her gender, she noted in the complaint, which her suit says is a violation of anti-discrimination laws But two months after the flight, she flew with easyJet  - this time back to London - and claims the same thing happened again. She claims she had not yet received any response to her complain when she took the flight and found herself being asked to move seats by two ultra-Orthodox men once again.  She claims that this time around, some other female passengers agreed to switch seats with the men so that Ms Wolfson did not have to move But she claims that once again flight attendants did not try to intervene or defend her seating rights, and again offered a free hot drink as compensation.  She says she filed a second complaint several days later, and when she never got a response she decided to launch a lawsuit. She is reportedly suing based on an Israeli law enacted in , which prohibits discrimination against customers on the basis of their race, religion, nationality, land of origin, gender, sexual orientation, political views or personal status. Ms Wolfson is reportedly being supported in her suit by the Israel Religious Action Center IRC – the advocacy arm of the Jewish reform movement which challenges issues like gender segregation. Although easyJet is not based in Israel, IRAC will argue that the first incident was subject to Israeli law while the plane was on the ground at Ben-Gurion International Airport, where the first incident took place. A spokeswoman for the airline told : At EasyJet we take claims of this nature very seriously. While it would be inappropriate to comment, as this matter is currently the subject of legal proceedings, we do not discriminate on any grounds.

The Toroja community of Indonesia pull their dead relativesapos corpses from their tombs, clean and clothe them before spending time with them, chatting and lighting cigarettes for them. Itaposs an annual tradition and happens every August before planting season in the community in Panggala, Nort Toraja, South Sulawesi, but the photos never fail to astound. The annual Toraja death rituals - or Ma’nene ritual - are inspired by the communityaposs belief in an infinite link between le and death. This year, two men are pictured with the mummied corpse of a dead relative, who has had a baseball cap stuck on his head and a cigarette in his mouth, which the men are lighting. The tribe consider the ritual a celebration of le and an act which honours the spirits of their ancestors. They interact with the mummied corpses asthey were alive, and clean their graves and replace decorated coffins before putting them back. The whole act is seen as something of a second funeral and steps are taken to prevent the bodies from decomposing. They are usually reentered with gts in their colourful coffins. And in the modern era, tribespeople use their smartphones to take pictures with their dead relatives.  In one picture, community member Roni Pasang hugs the corpse of his dead cousin. Families often keep the mummied corpses of the recently deceased in their homes for months - sometimes years - as they mourn and prepare and save money for the burial, which they find hugely signicant. Sometimes they use a ‘Tongkonan’ - a building specically designed to house the dead before burial.  The Torajans often get into crippling debt from funerals, as they place so much importance on death as the most important aspect of le. The dead are interacted with asthey are alive, often being included in family meals. In one image, the corpse of a little girl is seen newly clothed in a purple dress, shoes, a hair band and even a wig while Lin Arensia poses with her.  In a later picture, Lin takes a selfie with grandfather Ne Potta. The dead relatives are laid in their tomb in the fresh clothes, and every year knives are used to cut them away so it can be replaced. One picture shows a pair of Adidas shoes being placed on a relativeaposs foot.  Another corpse is given a new hat, sunglasses, shorts and a watch. Sticks are used to hold them up and the corpses are cleaned with dry paint brushes. Conversely, the Toraja people are a largely Protestant Christian community, living in a country where the majority of the population are Muslim.  But the annual tradition remains entrenched in their culture down the centuries. For Torajans, the death of the body isn’t seen as an abrupt event and attempts are made to keep them part of the family. According to their ancient belief system, the spirit of a dead person mustto his village of origin.  Soa person died on a journey, the dead person would be walked back home from the scene to the village. Torajan Eric Crystal Rante Allo last year told The Sydney Morning Herald: Toraja people believe the spirit of the dead lives among us, the living, looking out for us, blessing us. That’s why, before the ritual of the burial is performed, they are called to’makula, or just sick, not yet dead. Toraja’s people highly respect their dead.  Now Bartolomeus, a rice farmer, said: It’s like when you come home for Christmas, it’s that feeling of joy meeting someone you haven’t seen for a long time. A lot of people would consider a graveyard a scary place.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

The home must also be participating in weekly staff testing. There will be strict criteria and infection control measures.Residents# mental health and loneliness levels will be signicantly improved by more face-to-face contact with loved ones. It will also be of huge relief to family members who, at best, have only had one designated visitor or have been reliant on video or voice calls to check in on their well-being and have a chat.For months, residents have been coping and responding to coronavirus restrictions with extremely limited contact from family and friends, many doing so in semi-isolation, which has had a signicant impact on their mental and physical health as well as increasing loneliness.The benefits to residents# well-being after being able to see and interact with one visitor has been clear for all to see, so for them this expansion can’t come soon enough. Now they may be able to see more of their children and grandchildren which will be a tremendous boost to everyone.It’s been an incredibly hard time for care home residents and staff, who have been on the front line of this pandemic, and while safety for everyone concerned is paramount these measures may bring with them ato some kind of much-needed normality for those who really need it.Adam Stachura, Age Scotland head of policy and communications."},{"url":null,"title":"time to go dotty over argyll artists","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFans of creativity are being invited to follow the red dots on the trail of this year#s Artmap Argyll.Now in its th year, there are  artists and locations open to visitors over two weekends later this month.The dates are Friday August  to Monday August , then the following weekend, both from am to pm, although visitors are advised to ring ahead to check openings for the last two days.Because of coronavirus, each space will have its own guidance in place from one-way systems to limits on numbers and visitors are asked to respect those rules to help keep everyone safe.For the first time, Artmap includes an artist on Tiree # with a virtual show, as they do not want to encourage travel to the island # with others on the trail from as far north as Glencoe to Kilberry in the south.Numbered red dots guide visitors to the artists# studios, including gardens and Kilmartin Museum giving the region#s creatives a chance to showcase their work.There is no pressure to buy, but the opportunity is available, along with the joy of meeting the artist and seeing how the work is made.

Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges.

I share many of his concerns, and commend the series of articles.It would be good to hear from a range of Argyll and Bute residents with their ideas for how we get from #here# towards a better #there#. My personal pet project would be an Argyll and Bute Citizens’ Assembly, that would bring people together to generate real strategies to bring about just and #green# change for our area.A good start would be better transport links, via enhanced road and ferry services.A permanent solution to the Rest and be Thankful would be welcome, of course, but it was really heartening to see how Western Ferries rose to the challenge on Friday Auust .  They magicked away that endless queue at Gourock with great patience and goodwill and double service, showing what can be done.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,Following the latest landslide and road closure at the Rest and be Thankful, once again the road closure signs were placed at the wrong place on the Arrochar side.Having spoken to several of the local businesses owners, the main issue around the signs are they are too far away from the incident. There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense. Should anyone have to turn then there is ample space to do this.

Control system builders ITI will undertake the design, installation and commissioning of the upgrade across the station’s four units.The power station, constructed in a cavern within Ben Cruachan on the shores of Loch Awe, plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s electricity system throughout the Covid- pandemic due to its flexibility. The plant can generate power in less than a minute when needed and can also store excess electricity from the grid like a giant battery, a service which was called upon when the low electricity demand during the lockdown coincided with periods of high wind power in Scotland.The plant’s reversible turbines pump water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid. The stored water is then released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGordon Stewart from Ardfern sent us thisatmospheric photograph, taken from Corranmor Farm on Monday August .A stunning full rainbow appeared that day over Loch Craignish lagoon, captured by Gordon on camera.PIC:no_aYourPictures_Rainbow"},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy cowal highland gathering in the comfort of your own home","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWith just days to go until one of Scotland’s favourite events takes the virtual stage for the first time, Cowal Highland Gathering’s organisers are preparing to unveil a packed programme to a worldwide audience.Cowal’s Virtual Highland Gathering is an ambitious three-day event which mirrors as closely as possible the programme of the gathering itself.Kicking off on Thursday August , Cowal’s Virtual Gathering features a host of exclusive interviews and performances, together with a look back at some of the highlights of the -year-old event.The Gathering’s Friday night gig is back too, with the Gig at the Gathering Unplugged going live from pm.

Itrsquos not so easy to access, but the fact the trees are now under threat made me want to discover the place before it might be too late. As I write, the decision has yet to be made on the fate of the trees.Irsquom a lover of history and totally understand the need to create a safe, weather-proof home for these historic planes, and to keep the museum as much an authentic visiting experience as possible. But there is a huge amount of space in the existing museum area, so the destruction of woodland seems unnecessary.The museum argues that any additional modern structures near the runway will undermine the historic look of the airfield. The proposed new visitor centre will, they say, create much-needed new jobs. So cutting down the trees to move the planes and create a new home for them is, the museum authorities argue, the only realistic option for them. They say that refusal of their plans will put the new jobs at risk.I totally understand the need for jobs at this time in particular, but the trouble is the approach taken by the museum is part of the reason the world is facing an ecological crisis with deforestation, the destruction of habitats and the extinction of wildle. It is part of the mindset that sees nature as ldquoin the way of development.Donrsquot be ridiculously dramatic, I hear some folks say this is not the Amazon or a rainforest in Indonesia, itrsquos a small wood in East Lothian.And that is precisely the point. It is a small but very rare example of a wood with mature trees in our county. It is a special place, with a ersity of trees and buzzing with wildle. Walk under its canopy and you will discover that. I know itrsquos proposed to plant new trees in a dferent area as compensation, but this wonrsquot connect to the wood and will take generations to grow. It will never replace what will be lost.If we seriously want to do something about the ecological disaster we are making on our planet then we need to start in our own backyard. We canrsquot campaign against deforestation, habitat destruction and declare a climate emergency, and then say: ldquoWell, the rules donrsquot apply to us when we want to destroy woodland to move some planes.Deforestation has a multitude of justications all over the world: dam building, road construction, cattle ranching, extreme poverty of subsistence farmers, profit from timber, oil exploration and pipelines, mining: the list is long. The point is there will always be someone with an economic justication for environmental destruction.While it may be on a much smaller scale, the proposal to destroy irreplaceable woodland in order to move some planes is a product of the same mindset that has brought us to a point of environmental and climate crisis.This mindset is revealed in the Historic Environment Scotland response to the proposal. This is the public body charged with protecting Scotlandrsquos built heritage. It has said: ldquoWe would not consider the trees of Sunnyside Strip to be directly related to the cultural signicance of the scheduled monument ndash they are visible but do not relate to our understanding of the monument as a wartime airfield.In other words, woodland isnrsquot part of our heritage mature trees, many of which were around before the war, arenrsquot historic or worthy of value in themselves. Really The wood is far more a historic part of the wartime airfield site than the massive car park. It seems to be a very selective viewpoint.The truth is that the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on the planet. A quarter of our already-decimated wild mammals are in danger of extinction. Our woodlands are small and dispersed, but all the more vital for the habitat they provide. East Lothian has huge developmental pressure, and this wood is a rare and vital part of naturersquos increasingly precarious foothold in our county.A changed mindset would be one which makes the protection of nature and the environment the initial default position. Developers should then take this priority as the starting point for proposals.That hasnrsquot happened with this plan, and credit to the council for rejecting it.There has been so much publicity and justied outrage recently over the destruction and littering of our land by people lsquowildrsquo camping and disrespecting nature. So many people, it seems, just donrsquot care, or seem unable to appreciate the gt of our natural environment and its importance.There is a disconnect from nature at the heart of this. We will never solve the environmental and climate crisis we are in until we can foster love and appreciation of nature, of which we are a part. Our childrenrsquos future literally depends on this.And institutions such as National Museums Scotland should be part of the solution, not the problem. Instead of viewing the woodland as irrelevant to the visitor experience, it could be used to enhance it. The wood is a magic place, with younger trees growing amidst towering old mature ones.My kids were in wonder as they explored the wood, peering up at the tops of the trees, and an old oak caught their attention as its boughs seemed to dip asto say hello. We spent a wonderful hour being immersed in nature.Many of our children, in fact many adults, have limited opportunities to explore and enjoy such places. Imagine the extra possibility of a nature walk in the tall wood, where wildle thrives and trees older than the airfield can tell their story. This wood is not an intrusion for the visitor but a potential wonderful addition. Get the ranger service to do talks and tours about this amazing place, a treasure hunt use it to enhance peoplersquos connection to nature ndash an extra experience.Woodland is not just a habitat for wildle, itrsquos a habitat for us humans too. Enjoying nature and learning about its importance should not be seen as a contradiction to enjoying historic planes.While Irsquom aware that itrsquos only part of the wood under threat, the proposal to destroy a large section of it will result in a tragic loss of trees and the habitat they provide. But itrsquos not just the destruction in itself, itrsquos also the precedent and example it sets for future developments.I really hope the Reporter will uphold the councilrsquos decision, and the museum, which is a fantastic and well-loved historic place to visit, will consider a new location for the visitor centre. Then we will all be winners."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-august-18-20-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoENOUGH is enoughrsquo was the message from traders in North Berwick, reported the East Lothian Courier on August , .The opening of North Berwickrsquos sixth charity shop this week has sparked controversy ndash and fears have been raised that a seventh could be on the cards.Traders claimed the resort had now reached ldquosaturation point with fundraising outlets, which are now selling new goods in addition to second-hand items.They said the charities were setting up shop on prime sites, and argued that they were ldquosubsidising them through having to pay higher rates.Fears that the trend could ultimately lead to a downturn in the local economy and the death of the High Street as a shopping centre were also expressed.The row follows the opening of the Chest, Heart  Stroke Associationrsquos outlet at a former delicatessen shop in the High Street on Monday.A RE-ENACTMENT of the Battle of Dunbar was postponed as it clashed with a model power boat demonstration, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of August , .The re-enactment of the Battle of Dunbar, which is to be staged by the Royal Scots as part of their recruiting drive in East Lothian, has been postponed for a week because it would have clashed with the running of a model power boat demonstration to be held on Sunday, September .

This is how I heard about an otter at the Esk for the first time three years ago.A few people mentioned they had seen this elusive creature a few years ago, but never since.The otter became my new photography challenge. I tried visiting the river at dferent times of the day, especially at dawn and dusk, when otters are more active, always trying to keep the noise down to a minimum.After two years of searching, my hope was gone and I almost gave up. Until one sunny day in April during lockdownhellipThe weather that day was enjoyable, so Chris and I decided to go on a walk. The local path was very busy the dog walkers, cyclists, families with children and joggers were enjoying the sun whilst social distancing.As always, I kept my eyes low on the water hoping to see the kingfisher.As we followed the river upstream to the area at The Grove, I spotted something moving in the water.I grabbed Chrisrsquo hand and I pulled him down on the ground right behind a bush.It was not a kingfisher but something I did not expect to see in the middle of the day... an otter fishing!We managed to crawl down the slope and lie down so we would not disturbit.Whilst I was photographing the otter, I also heard a cheery pee-pee-pee and saw the kingfisher flying past the otter. What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo. The size of their territory ies and depends on the quality of the habitat, amount of food and number of possible holts.It is also known that a male otter has a larger territory that can even overlap several female ottersrsquo territories. Otters usually have a well-defined area within their grounds in which they feed, rest and breed.Seeing signs of otters is generally easier than seeing the animals themselves. If you happen to find yourself at the riverbank or a sea loch, look for five-toed footprints and otter droppings , that are left in places such as fallen trees, rocks and weirs.Spraints are easily identiable as they contain visible fish bones and have a characteristic and not particularly unpleasant smell that has been described as ranging from fish to freshly brewed jasmine tea!The otter that you may see at the coast is very often called a lsquosea otterrsquo however, this is the same species as the animals that live further inland.If you would like to share how you get on finding the otters oryou have any rare kind of wildle in your area, I would love to hear from you.Speak to you next month!zanslensfacebook zanslens instagram zans_lens twitter zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"tantallon-castle-john-muir-birthplace-among-attractions-reopening","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandhas confirmed that Tantallon Castle, east of North Berwick, will accept visitors with pre-booked tickets from next Friday .A phased reopening of some HES sites across the county has begun, but there is no date yet for when Dirleton Castle could reopen.Both of these county attractions closed in March when lockdown was initiated to combat the coronavirus pandemic.A statement from HES said: ldquoAfter what has felt like historyrsquos longest wait, the easing of certain lockdown restrictions means you and your family can now grab a well-earned change of scenery at a selection of our safe and secure sites.ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to welcome you back and we would like to thank you for your patience and perseverance in staying home during this pandemic.ldquoWhen you arrive at any of our reopening sites, wersquoll need to work together to make sure we are all following the rules and staying protected.Entry tickets for Tantallon Castle can now be pre-booked via the website historicenviron ment.scotWalk-up visitors without an advanced booking will not be able to gain entry.Meanwhile, in another boost for the countyrsquos residents and visitors, the museum telling the story of Dunbarrsquos most famous son has reopened its doors.The John Muir Birthplace Museum welcomed back visitors on Tuesday for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak started.The museum, on the townrsquos High Street, allows visitors to explore the le and legacy of the man recognised as the father of the US national park system, in the house where he was born.Meanwhile, further attractions are also available for visitors to see at the National Museum of Flight, East Fortune.Hangar had already been open, along with the historic airfield and the parachute store.Now, the military aviation and civil aviation hangars have also opened to the public.Lucy Casot, CEO of Museums Galleries Scotland, said: ldquoWith so many of our museums and galleries across Scotland now able to open, therersquos so much to choose from, many with wonderful outdoor spaces to enjoy with the whole family.ldquoItrsquos not just a fun day out museums and galleries have a positive impact on our social wellbeing as well as the local economy, so we are urging everyone to make a point of visiting their favourite museum or gallery.ldquoAdditionally, with many of us staycationing this year, it is a wonderful opportunity to discover more of Scotlandrsquos inspiring museums and galleries."},{"url":null,"title":"retired-musselburgh-nurse-writes-book-caring-people-dementia","story":"Dee Jenkins, , of Eskmills Road, said the main aim of the publication ndash I Remember Dementia ndash was to encourage carers of dementia patients.Born in Dublin in , Mrs Jenkins, who has lived in Musselburgh for  years, came to Scotland in  to enter a religious order, the Novitiate for the Sisters of La Sagesse, at Leuchie House, North Berwick.

Although their summits are mostly rounded and sweeping, they combine to make a vast and wholly unique landscape.The mountains in the Cairngorms rise up out of the remnants of the ancient Caledonian pinewoods and are home to superb wildle and an array of dramatic corries. Braeriach is the third highest mountain in the British Isles and is protected by a long approach walk through a natural tree line.This Munro comes in at km and takes around - hours to complete.Braeriach, Aviemore, PH QTBraeriachBeinn Alligin, TorridonBeinn Alligin, meaning jewelled mountain, is one of three of the Torridon giants and well deserving of its name. This magnicent pair of munros has its own pinnacle ridge called the Horns of Alligin.Sitting on the seaward side of Torridon it has an unmatched viewpoint with glimpses of Skye and the sea to one side, and great peaks on the other side with the Horns providing a stunning foreground.The Munro is around km and takes around - hours.Beinn Alligin Torridon, Alligin, AchnasheenBuachaille Etive Mor, Glen CoeBuachaille Etive Mor is the head of Glen Coe and reigns supreme with its awe-inspiring pyramidal appearance. It is affectionately known by many climbers as the Bookie and, along with its twin Buachaille Etive Beag, are among the most photographed of the Scottish mountains and itrsquos easy to see why!This Munro is perfect for those who want a climb and some incredible views.It is around km and takes around - hours to complete.Aonach Eagach Ridge, A, Ballachulish PH HXLiathach, TorridonAnother of Torridonrsquos three mountains, Liathach is perhaps the finest of them all. Its higher Munro looks almost inaccessible from most directions and even the easiest ascent involves a bit of scrambling but itrsquos certainly worth the effort.Beyond this point the mountain becomes even more dramatic and offers the perfect path for thrill seekers to climb to the top. The hidden north side of the mountain is even more spectacular and is well worth exploring.Slightly longer than the other of Torridonrsquos mountains this walk is around .km and takes around - hours.Achnasheen, IV ETLiathachSgurr nan Gillean, SkyeMany regard Sgurr nan Gillean as being the finest peak on Skye and it is one of the more dficult on this list. Even the easiest ascent on the southeast ridge is a pretty tough scramble ndash the other two ridges venturing into the realm of rock climbing.It appears fairly dramatic from Sligachan but this actually conceals much of the mountainrsquos finest features and its only upon a closer visit to Coire a Bhasteir that the true scale and magnicence of the Pinnacle Ridge reveals this Munrorsquos true stature.This walk is around km and takes roughly  to  hours to complete.Skye, IV SW"},{"url":null,"title":"recipe-gary-townsends-italian-style-meatloaf","story":"Serves  +Ingredientsg pork minceg beef minceSliced pancetta or streaky bacon x shallots ndash diced x garlic cloves ndash dicedml red wine x whole eggsg grated parmesan cheese x slices of bread blitzed for breadcrumbs x whole diced tomatoes Sprig of sage ndash finely choppedSprig of rosemary ndash finely choppedSaltBlack Pepper ndash fine x knob butterMethod:Pre-heat oven to c gas mark .

Indeed, Mr Galloway goes further and describes a breakaway Scotland as more akin to a partition of the UK with the danger of Ulsterisation of Scotland to follow. In other words, there could be regions of Scotland who voted to remain in a future referendum which may refuse to be dragged out of the Unionthe independence camp won without a clear majority and Scots and armed forces based in England were denied the vote.Ms Sturgeon once publicly admitted that nationalism must ldquotranscend Brexit, oil and the economy as she had effectively lost the economic case for independence since oil prices crashed. Interestingly the Alliance for Unity party uses a similar message but it claims its party transcends all political beliefs of the left, right and centre in their common cause to defeat nationalism.

Inevitably there will be attacks on the SNP Govern-mentrsquos record over its years in office, on which even its supporters must recognise it is vulnerable.Despite all this, Mr Gunn appears to be of the view that sufficient indication of support for another referendum will be demonstratedcurrent pollsrsquo expectations that the SNP will win the most seats are correct. However, he needs to explain why he considers seats won through an election system devised to elect members to the Scottish Parliament should be preferred, as an indicator of voters intentions on an independence referendum, to the total numbers of votes cast by the actual voters for the respective parties, supporting pro or con  Is he concerned that the latter is much closer to an actual referendum and could very well provide a majority of voters against independence On any fair analysis, the  election cannot provide a compelling case for another referendum, how-ever much it is spun by those who want it to be.Alan Fitzpatrick, Dunlop.SCOTLANDS greatest gt to the world has been the Scottish diaspora. Many retain family and sentimental links to Scotland. Many are domiciled in rUK. Many would seek to become citizens of an independent Scotland, perhaps joint passport-holders. This privilege would be available especially to those born in Scotland but resident in rUK, among whom are my daughter and son. I consider that they should have a vote in any future Scottish independence referendum.Michael Gove has aroused the anger of the SNP by proposing that hundreds of thousands of Scots living in rUK should be given a vote in a future independence referendum . Michael Russell, the SNPs Constitution Minister, has accused Mr Gove of trying to gerrymander the vote. Gerrymandering is an attempt to establish a political advantage for a particular party or group by adjusting district boundaries. Mr Russell alleges, but technically in error, what could be considered a iant of gerrymandering by expanding, or restricting, the voter pool for political advantage. The Scottish Government has engaged in iant gerrymandering by conferring voting rights upon those aged  years or older. The SNP may or may not be content with the outcome to date of such action, but cannot claim innocence.William Durward, Bearsden.APART from Alexander McKayrsquos unnecessary reference to foreigners and his forgetting that several democratic mandates exist for another referendum , there is no justication for people who have moved from Scotland to have a vote on our future.Only those adults who live here and registered to pay income tax to the Scottish Government should have a vote in any Scottish referendum. Also, given the amount of ldquodirty money funnelled to the EU Leave campaign, only iniduals who are registered to pay Scottish income tax should be allowed to make donations to either side with a ban on corporate, business, trade union, trusts and association funding.This would go some way to balancing the huge publicity advantage the No side has when London broadcasters who are hostile to independence dominate our TV news and current affairs programmes together with the bulk of the popular press owned outside Scotland that oppose our self-determination.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh EH.ALEXANDER McKay, like many of your other Unionist correspondents, is very good at complaining about independence and does not mind twisting facts to suit his case. Today he saysanother referendum happens it will be ldquoanother once in a letime referendum forced upon us. Nowhere in the  referendum was there any legal commitment binding future politicians to such a scenario of a ldquoonce in a letime Scottish referendum and I ask him to prove otherwise, whilst also defining the period of a letime.Nicola Sturgeon has stated an independence referendum will feature in the  Holyrood election manesto and all Mr McKay has to do is muster support against a referendum and let the people choose, just as they have done with our current Holyrood Government and Westminster MPs. Mr McKay can be further assured that should such a referendum take place, he will have a second opportunity to muster further support to vote against Scotland being a sovereign country. It all seems very fair and democratic to me with no one forced to do anything, but perhaps Mr McKay thinks otherwise It is to be hoped that in their argument against independence, Unionists might wish to build their case by illustrating the specic benefits to Scotland from remaining within the Union other than the sheer incompetence of saddling us with unimaginable debt under the care of Westminster.

Across the UK, as headlines foretold the devastation lockdown would wreak on this seasonal trade ndash footage of acres of wilting plants was grim ndash cannier businesses immediately shted to online and telephone orders. And, as recent figures show, people responded enthusiastically. During that period, Britons spent around pound. billion on garden plants, materials and tools. Contrary to the stereotypical picture of a Mr McGregor retiree, footering around in his potting shed, it was millennials who spent most. Their investment was double that of the rest of us, with the - age group spending an average pound per person, compared with pound among others.Some of that might be explained by the urgent need for equipment to turn a rectangle of grass into a more imaginative space for all the family to enjoy. Irsquom long past their age but still so new to gardening that I recall those early months as a ceaseless outlay on shears, secateurs, spades, forks, trowels, rakes, sieves... I could go on. Hence the need for a shed, which was soon festooned with tools dangling from hooks, propped against walls and stacked on shelves. Think of an Italian deli, with hams and salamis overhead, and floor to ceiling storage. Replace the delicious aroma of cheeses, coffee beans and truffles with potting compost, muddied buckets and oil to keep blades moving, and you get the picture.There are professional horticulturalists where I live who are well under , but thatrsquos probably not surprising. Those who choose to live in the country are already keen on the outdoors, whatever their vintage. Yet there is something of a renaissance occurring in this generation, as interest in their own plot is sparked into le, whether itrsquos an allotment, balcony, or back yard.In response to what you might call a growing trend, Alan Titchmarsh has said that he hopes more young folk will be encouraged to pick up their trowels and dig up drives, to help protect the planet. ldquoItrsquos not just about going on marches, he says. ldquoBeing practical is a hugely underrated resource and skill.Those who have unexpectedly found themselves with time to devote to their patch have probably realised how enjoyable it is too. Being in the fresh air, surrounded by birds, and perhaps with children larking around, has shown how much pleasure can be had in maintaining your part of the world. At this stage of le, competition for peoplersquos spare time is usually ferocious, with the demands of socialising, keeping fit and raising a family. In the past, unless you were actively emulating the Good Le, choosing to spend the weekend planting drills of potatoes or deadheading roses was borderline eccentric.Being forced to spend so much time at home has clearly made people reassess their outdoor space, and consider its potential. Making their plot child-friendly has been a priority for some. But for those who dread the thought of a football landing on tender seedlings and new blooms, there should be no conflict between serious cultivation and youngsters ndash quite the opposite. The earlier children encounter flowers and trees and the wildle they attract, the better for all our futures. And the sooner they recognise the need to treat living things with respect ndash although some trampling and breakage is almost inevitable ndash the more they will understand not just how nature works, but the ways in which we can support it.Irsquove lost count of the number of people who have said how much they have relished this aspect of lockdown. Having nowhere  to go has allowed them to concentrate on matters horticultural, and take time to make decisions or try experiments they otherwise could not have attempted. Having many more unfilled free hours has its upsides, as one neighbour has discovered. When the pandemic took hold she turned her greenhouse into a hotbed of tomatoes and her flowerbeds into a lettuce patchwork, and has been feasting on salads all summer. As have her friends.Inevitably, once the world opens up again, some recent converts will lose interest and the weeds will take revenge. Yet I have no doubt that many will already be hooked. The secret that no gardener ever mentions is that it is addictive. Each tiny success gives confidence to try something more adventurous. Mistakes are inevitable, but so are accidental triumphs. The thrill of discovering strawberries or nasturtiums thriving where before was a bed of nettles, is inspiring. The sight of bees and birds hovering for nectar, seeds and grubs is like preparing a banquet and watching as guests pile their plates high. To be honest, environmental reasons for sustainable, eco-friendly gardening are all but forgotten in the joy it brings. The reason why benches in most well-tended grounds go largely unused is because therersquos always something clamouring for attention. To sit sipping a GT while an unpruned shrub stares at you reproachfully, or a juicy stick of rhubarb cries out to be picked, is almost impossible.In my own limited experience, trying to keep on top of it all ndash and never coming remotely close ndash is part of what it is about. An expert recently told me that a garden will take all the time you give it, and then some. Yet the depths of winter is the time to put your feet up . The rest of the year is for helping the green things around you put down sturdy roots. As millennials can confirm, it has a very stabilising, calming effect on us too.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

because of the coronavirus and there were no plans to revive it.Despite citing the pandemic as the reason for not producing a detailed economic case for independence,Ms Forbes also said the pandemic showed why Scotland shouldbe independent to control its economy.The Tories said thatthe SNPs finance secretary couldnt produce an economic case for independence, there was no reason to believe there was one.The U-turn was confirmed as the annual Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotlandreport showed Scotlandrsquos notional deficit was . per cent of GDP in  , as public spending north of the border outstripped tax revenues by pound.billion.The GERS numbers were seized upon by Unionist parties to claim an independent Scotland would struggle with inherited debt and be forced into austerity measures to reduce it.In January, Ms Forbesrsquos predecessor as Finance Secretary Derek Mackay announced he would publish an alternative set of figures alongside GERS in future.He said he felt ldquofrustrated by GERS, as it only dealt with Scotlandrsquos current place in the Union, not its potential outside it.With GERS distrusted by many Nationalists, Mr Mackay acknowledged his ldquoeconomic case for independence this autumn would be a ldquoconcession to unhappy SNP members.Nicola Sturgeon defended the idea after it was branded amateurish propaganda and a waste of public

Fortunately, HM Treasury has bailed Scotland out in this Covid crisis, so, while the - figures will be excruciating, Scotland will survive, thanks to taxpayers in the southeast of England. Would anyone who can count support leaving the UK under these circumstances Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh EH.THE publication of the latest GERSfigures has triggered a now-traditional feeding frenzy.A black hole in Scotlandrsquos finances is heralded by unionist politicians as validating the continuation of their beloved Union.The killer phrase for me from the GERS report is: ldquoThe report is designed to allow users to understand and analyse Scotlandrsquos fiscal position under dferent scenarios within the current constitutional framework.GERS is therefore a measure of the public finances, under the current Union, hardly the greatest endorsement for how the economy has been managed on the UKrsquos watch.Major economic levers required to stimulate economic growth are still currently reserved to Westminster.It is indeed a bizarre scenario when politicians from unionist parties, who should be ashamed at the situation, actively gloat and support a Union that has mismanaged the economy so appallingly.GERS is a set of figures, based on a measure of guesswork that indicate very little, except highlighting the negatives of the current Union. It has little bearing on the finances of an independent Scotland.The point of independence is not to do everything in the same way as it has been done within the current constitutional framework, but to move away from this one-size-fits-all fiscal straitjacket to a tailored approach that prioritises stimulating economic growth.Alex Orr, Edinburgh EH.TODAY the annual GERS numbers have been revealed and no doubt there will be the usual bunfight about their relevance to the constitutional debate. If I might take a dferent tack: the SNP administration is to be congratulated on its determination to publish these figures annually. Not every political party would persist in publishing economic data which has the potential to destroy its raison detre.In a sea of misinformation and spin, GERS stands out as a beacon of truth and accuracy. When we are told that Scotland is doing so much better than the rest of the country on Covid- deaths, but the statistics show dferent, we still have GERS to restore our faith in objective facts. When the first serious outbreak of Covid- in the country is in Edinburgh but the First Minister forgets to tell us about it, we have GERS to remind us that some uncomfortable truths can still make in into the public domain. When we are told that ministers have no say in infectious patients being discharged into care homes but official letters show dferent, when the Education Secretary endorses an equation that seriously disadvantages working class pupils, and when the same Education Secretary does a u-turn on his equation and claims that makes it all right, when Cabinet Secretaries deny that fiscal transfers happen while demanding the continuation of the UK furlough scheme, when the First Minister says we have extra Covid testing capacity but people from Glasgow are told to go to Belfast for a test, GERS is an important truth that we can hold to, a shining light in a murky forest of obfuscation and incompetence. And when we have a succession of Finance Secretaries whose economic qualications seem to be the possession of the requisite numbers of fingers and toes, its nice to know that some competent people are actually keeping the score.So, when we are told that independence transcends everything and that all routes through independence would lead to a prosperous sunny upland, the SNPs own GERS publication is there to remind us, and itit has the wit and honesty to admit it, that such a view is the acme of economic illiteracy and, in the wise words of a prominent nationalist politician, stupidity on stilts.Alex Gallagher, Labour Councillor, North Ayrshire Council, Largs.THANK you, Iain Macwhirter, now we have an article on independence that is relatively neutral in tonereceives a large tranche of its electricity and gas from us, so would be daft to restrict trade on political grounds. A new trading arrangement should be ldquothe easiest in history to reach.Sharing a currency with a country whose economyis erging from your own cannot work. All new countries, like the Czech Republic and Slovakia, adopt new currencies almost immediately, and that is what Scotland should aim for. It is ridiculousthat we have no clear break-down of Scotlandrsquos economy, revenues, GDP, expenditure, perhaps only months away from independence, because the UK government will not direct the civil service to provide this information. No serious economist would trust GERS to provide other than the vaguest guestimate of our fiscal position post-Union. A lot will depend on the nature of the dissolution and the subsequent allocation of assets. Funnily enough, that is something unionist politicians commentators donrsquot ever like to talk about. If independence is a serious proposition, then it behoves the media to start asking questions of both sides.GR Weir, Ochiltree.ALAN Fitzpatrickclings desperately to the \"once in a generation\" anthem and wondersstatements in the Scotlands People publication \"could be construed as amounting to a verbal contract with the electorate\". Mr Fitzpatricks memory appears to be selective as he makes no mention of the infamous \"Vow\" to which all three unionist party leaders signed up and promptly forgot about and as for Mr Fitzpatricks comment regarding the old saying that \"an Englishmans word is his bond\", the word was that Scotlands position in the EU could only be guaranteed by voting No to independence, and the bond was broken at the EU referendum so much for that \"verbal contract\".I would remind Mr Fitzpatrick that the SNPs  manesto stated that there would not be a second independence referendum, unless there was \"a signicant and material change of circumstances, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will\".

I believe that OLA representing the cattle industry in Orkney can have a strong association with Moredun in the future.#Beth Wells, from Moredun, said “Through meetings we have been fortunate to meet many of Orkney’s livestock farmers, who are well known for their high quality beef production and we are delighted to be developing a closer working collaboration with OLA, which will be of huge benefit to both of our organisations.”OLA is a sub-group of HiHealth Herdcare which is a national cattle health scheme. Karen Johnston, from OLA, said: “We are delighted and very honoured to give our members the opportunity to benefit from expert information and support from such a prestigious and well respected organisation.  We are looking forward to seeing how this partnership progresses and the benefits it brings to Orkney farmers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise. Assurances that Ministers will now ‘pick up the ball again’ are likely to ring hollow with islanders who just want a date for cheaper fares to be introduced.“Meantime, Ministers could help soften the blow from the delayed introduction of RET by using the underspend to cut fares on Orkney’s internal ferry services.

But this week he wished a fond farewell to his feathered friend and sent her on a southbound trip that involved local RSPB manager Helen Moncrieff, NorthLink Ferries and an Aberdeenshire-based horse transportation company, which offered to take Patricia back to her home coop.Patricia should be reunited with her grateful owner this weekend. Eighty-two year-old John Wheeler lives in the far-off village of Hucclecote ndash over  miles away.Mr Jamieson said his suspicions that he may have had more than just an ordinary pigeon on his hands arose when Patricia appeared reluctant to leave.ldquoIt was in our hen run and the hens were making a commotion, he said.ldquoIt was just a rag of bones.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.jpg","title":"royal celtic societys unique music","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWork has begun on processing the twenty entries received for a unique competition which set the country’s musicians the challenge of creating a new shinty composition.

We recognise that there are circumstances that may make it dficult for people to wear face coverings. In these cases, there are acceptable reasons for not wearing a face covering, including for medical considerations or those with hearing loss who rely on lip-reading to communicate with others.We ask our university community to be respectful of others, and mindful that the reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be apparent or visible.The university said it will also supply face shields to staff in certain roles, including lecturing, teaching and during practical classes.

Kerry McWilliams, the founder of Lightwork NI, a charity that has provided more than  sessions of direct support to families over the past two months, said the crossover between school and family le was a major issue for many of the people she has worked with throughout the pandemic. Kerry said they have found that while children were largely able to keep in touch with the outside world and their peers through the likes of social media, many were uncomfortable being taught by their parents. And she said the stresses experienced by some groups of parents, such as key workers or those who had lost their income, made it more dficult for adults to support their children effectively. Home schooling was a cause of signicant conflict and distress, she said. Parents told us they found it very dficult to get children to do the work children told us they were afraid of being found out.One nine-year-old boy told me, #I don#t want to do school work with my parents because they think I#m really smart and they#re going to find out I#m not - I get good marks because I cheat and copy and when they see I can#t do the work they#re going to know#. This was a common fear for children - a sense of discomfort as school invaded their homes and family relationships. Most children like to keep school and home separate. Parents felt exposed and vulnerable as they were unable to understand or support their children#s learning.Many couldn#t access ICT equipment or provide internet access for multiple children and this led to frustration. She continued: We have lived through a global pandemic, a moment in history unprecedented in modern society. Families I have worked with have all moved through paralysing fear, powerlessness and panic. They have taken a fresh look at what makes them happy, what is worth fighting for - we all realised it#s not toilet roll - and how far they have sleepwalked into a le they wouldn#t have consciously chosen, and don#t really want to go back to. I believe the legacy and consequences of lockdown will be signicant for everyone both in the immediate future and for many years to come.She said there are a number of steps parents can take in the coming weeks and months to ensure their children cope with theto school, including drawing upon the relationships that were built during lockdown and ensuring children#s voices are heard. She also recommended putting in place routines and precautions to ensure everyone feels safe: Then you can stop worrying. Our worries communicate to children - when you feel confident and optimistic, they will too.

It#s been an incredibly rushed and quick turn around, but it#s not really until the children are back that we will see how it will work as that may well throw up other issues that we haven#t even thought of yet.Ms White added: However, one of the most fundamental things we need clarity on is what should be done straight awaya child or staff member tests positive for Covid-.

The Home Education in the North West group also reported an increased interest from parents.Some have jumped at the opportunity and have already sent in their deregisteration letters to their schools, a spokesperson said. Others are now seriously considering keeping their kids home and have joined the group to test the waters.Offering advice, the spokesperson said that home-schooled children still have plenty of opportunities for socialising and that parents can tailor teaching.She added that families should establish a timetable that fits their routine, to make the most of one-to-one attention and use a mixture of online resources and traditional learning.Making use of the local library, spending more time learning outdoors and getting in touch with other home school families in the area was also recommended.Experienced home schooler Susan Keenanfrom east Belfast took her sons Benand Tomout of class for two years, travelling to the Far East with her husband Michael .This term they are ing to class by choice at Sullivan Upper, but Susan said she fully understands why more parents will want to continue lessons at home.Ben started back into fourth year and Tom is due to start third year. Tom#s happy to go back while Ben#s not so sure it#s what he wants to do, she said.So I#ve told him just to try it and see how he feels about it, andhe wants to continue with home schooling he can.She added: I think after lockdown a lot more parents have realised how much you can get done on a one-to-one basis.You can get through the curriculum much quicker at home, but then there is the socialising aspect at school. But I don#t know how much socialising there#s really going to be at the minute.Kids will be in their bubbles and only mixing in their own class.While acknowledging home schooling wasn#t for everyone, she disagreed it damaged future job prospects.Absolutely not, because I do think a lot more rounded learning goes on at home rather than the rote learning you do to get ready for your exams.I know when we went away with our children they learnt about dferent cultures and religions, food and more.So I do think you need to encourage your children to get their qualications in case they want to go university and we didn#t want our decisions to negatively impact on any future choices they will have.

Education Minister Peter Weir is recommending that school children should wear face coverings in corridors FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPupils from Bloomfield Collegiate in Belfast wearing face coverings. By Steven AlexanderAugust   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailEducation Minister Peter Weir has announced that guidance on face coverings will be updated to include a recommendation to wear them in corridors of post-primary schools.This will come into effect on August  when schoolson a full-time basis.Pupils ing to school in England will not be required to wear face coverings, with Downing Street saying yesterday there were no plans to change the guidance. The World Health Organisation and UN children#s agency Unicef advise that children aged  and over should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a one-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area.The Schools Standards Minister in England Nick Gibb had indicated that hygiene measures put in place in classes meant masks were not required. Mr Gibb told the BBC: If a school puts in place the measures that are in the guidance that we issued in early July, all the hygiene measures that I#ve been talking about, then masks are not necessary for staff or pupils. England#s deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries said the evidence on whether children over  should wear masks in schools was not strong. However, older pupils in Scotland will be required to wear face coverings in between lessons from next week.Face coverings should be worn by staff and pupils when moving around secondary schools in Scotland from August , according to Holyrood#s Education Secretary.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseEducation Minister Peter Weir is recommending that school children should wear face coverings in corridors FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappEducation Minister Peter Weir is recommending that school children should wear face coverings in corridorsJohn Swinney said that the rule will apply on school transport for primary school pupils aged five and above, and all those at secondary school in communal areas, but not in classrooms.Previous advice in Northern Ireland had made it mandatory for all pupils aged  and over to wear a face covering on public transport, or when large numbers of staff or pupils gathered within an enclosed space where social distancing was not possible.However, they were not generally recommended for routine use in schools.But last night Mr Weir said: Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time.The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings.My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so.In relation to communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible. Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings.I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice.Sinn Fein MLA John O#Dowd has said the decision should have been introduced with immediate effect.The Upper Bann MLA and former Education Minister said: The safety of children and young people while at school is an absolute priority for everyone.New guidance from the World Health Organisation has strongly recommended the need to introduce the wearing of face coverings in secondary schools.While the decision to introduce the wearing of face coverings in school corridors, communal areas and school transport is welcome, it should be implemented immediately, not with any delay.This latest move by the Minister is yet another example of lack of clear decision-making and guidance which has caused confusion for parents, teachers and students.Belfast Most ReadIncident in which NI restaurant turned away ambulance worker because of Covid risk #regrettable#, says hospitality chiefMan attacked by group of youths in Belfast sectarian hate crime Let there be light: Derelict Belfast church transformed into heavenly homesSupplier to Wrightbus goes bust with loss of  jobsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Wet pubs to remain closed after virus spike,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I had to find a diamond to win and, for some reason, I thought the card wasn’t a winner at first. But then I saw the diamond.“I genuinely couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I didn’t say a word. I just sat there staring at the scratchcard and I went as white as a sheet – so much so that my friends were asking what was wrong. Without speaking, I showed them the card so they could see for themselves.“Nobody could believe it. A couple of the guys actually thought it was a prank with a fake card – but one guy knew that I’d bought it and confirmed that it was legit.Corey continued: “So, after some socially-distanced cheering and jumping about, I called my aunt Edel to break the news and my mum who lives in Scotland. I must admit that emotion got the better of me and I cried my eyes out as I told them what had happened. They couldn’t believe it either.“Then I went home after about an hour, called the number on the back of the scratchcard and confirmed everything with a lovely lady on the end of the phone at the National Lottery Line.”That night Corey was still trying to process it all.He said: “I was so restless and I sat on the edge of the bed most of the night until I finally fell asleep. I woke up a couple of hours later wonderingit was all a dream and then checked where I had hidden the card and was delighted to see that it was still there.

There are a couple of houses on the market that I have my eye on.“I’d also like to go on holiday when it’s safe to do so and, as a big Manchester United fan, a trip or two to Old Trafford will hopefully be on the cards when sporting events are open to the public again.“The new PlayStation  will be out soon so I’ll buy one of those as well and a few games to keep me going,” continued Corey.“In the meantime, I’ll not do anything too hasty and make sure to sort my family out with a little something.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappTaoiseach Micheal Martin said the golf dinner was a monumental error of judgment on behalf of all those who attended .Hugh O#ConnellAugust   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailTAOISEACH Micheál Martin has said Phil Hogan “undermined the whole approach to public health in Ireland” with his movements around the country in recent weeks.Mr Martin said Mr Hogan’s “changing narrative” was a “signicant dficulty” for the Government but declined to explicitly state it had lost confidence in the Commissioner or that he should resign.Mr Martin was speaking amid doubts over Mr Hogan’s future as EU Trade Commissioner over his attendance at an Oireachtas Golf Society and movements around Ireland in the days leading up to that event.“We’ve made very clear our anger and annoyance,” he said. “We’ve made that very clear.”The Irish Government believes that Mr Hogan breached public health restrictions - a claim denied by the former Fine Gael Cabinet Minister. Mr Hogan’s future is set to be determined by European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, who is studying the Commissioner#s account of his movements.Mr Martin said there was “considerable resistance” to the idea of national governments seeking to influence the Commission President about the removal of a commissioner. He said the commissioner is accountable to the Commission, not to the Oireachtas or the Government.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland fc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-d-d-a-fbbf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland fc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-d-d-a-fbbf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland fc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-d-d-a-fbbf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland fc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-d-d-a-fbbf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland fc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-d-d-a-fbbf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland fc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-d-d-a-fbbf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland fc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-d-d-a-fbbf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland fc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-d-d-a-fbbf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland fc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-d-d-a-fbbf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland fc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-d-d-a-fbbf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan has been asked to consider his position by Micheal Martin and Leo Varadkar PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappEU trade commissioner Phil Hogan has been asked to consider his position by Micheal Martin and Leo Varadkar “We’re very clear in terms of the importance of ensuring we’re not seeking to influence the President of the Commission,” he saidAskedthe Commissioner should resign he said he was not going beyond the statement issued by the three Coalition leaders on Tuesday night.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would open in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors. The third thing is that there’s a real opportunity to improve recruitment anyway, because people like to come to places that are involved in medical education. And another benefit is the fact that medical students don’t just stay in their university, they like to get involved with the local community through classes and societies, so they will often run resuscitation training courses for kids in schools, they might work with a range of community groups doing volunteering. So I think everywhere you turn you would see real benefits to the school the medicine and these students in the city.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dara saw off tough competition from Paloma Faith’s other acts, Isla and Hayley, to become her representative in the final four. ”You have this amazing talent that’s technical but feels so sensitive,” said the coach. ”That feeds into the way you sing because it’s just pure beauty.” The St Colm’s High School pupil was congratulated by his family after his performance and can now look forward to the final round of the competition. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jeananne Craig worked in the English capital and Dublin for more than a decade, reporting on breaking news and showbiz red carpets.  But after the birth of her second child in , the Rosemount woman decided to relocate to the city where she grew up. “I had a great time in London and some amazing experiences there, but like many Derry people living away from home, I always missed it,” Jeananne said. “We moved to Derry a year and a half ago and are so happy to be here, particularly in the last six months, when having a bit more space and being close to family and nature has been so important.” googletag.cmd.push With a growing trend for people looking to leave built-up cities for quieter, more affordable locations post-lockdown, Jeananne decided to share her experience and that of other ‘city quitters’ in a podcast. All Change Please is co-hosted by Jeananne, who now works as a freelance journalist and copywriter, and her friend and fellow journalist, Jayne Cherrington-Cook, who left London for Kent. They release new episodes fortnightly and interviewees in series one include s music royalty-turned-designer Pearl Lowe, who moved from London to Somerset, Irish presenter and illustrator Maggie Molloy, and original Big Brother winner Craig Phillips, who reveals he once rented a room from the shows notorious Nasty Nick. googletag.cmd.push We cover all sorts of topics, from the practicalities of moving, to working from home and making friends somewhere new - and whether people have any regrets about leaving a big city, said Jeananne. Its all done remotely with Jayne in Kent, me in Derry and our guest joining from wherever theyre based. I actually have to record in my parents house, my own is too noisy with two young children running around and wanting to join in, said Jeananne who, plans to include some well-known local names soon.The logo for All Change Please was designed by local artist Bronach Crabtee, aka The Crafty Crab. The plan is to attract listeners considering a move, but I think our interviewees have such interesting stories to tell, it will make a good listen for anyone looking for a new podcast to enjoy, Jeananne added. The first two episodes of All Change Please are online now, with new episodes released fortnightly on a Thursday. The podcast is available on iTunes, Spoty and Acast, and is on Twitter @allchangepod https:podcasts.apple gb podcast all-change-please id  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Micky Doherty was presented with the Foyle Pride Mark Ashton Award for Outstanding Contribution to the LGBTQ+ community by the citys real Mayor, SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney, at a ceremony at the Holywell Trusts Garden of Remembrance on Saturday night. A spokesperson for Foyle Pride said Mr Doherty, who fronts the citys Pride parade each year, was a truly deserving winner who does so much, for not only the LGBTQ+ community, but also the wider city and district community. Mr Doherty is a tireless charity fundraiser and helped set up a special fund to help local people in need during the oronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push Im known in the local area as being a charity fundraiser-theres a charity fundraiser Ill host it, said Mr Doherty. Its just part of me that I like helping people. During lockdown I knew people had started to struggle and they were coming to me and I started to think about how I could help. Because I have been working with charities for a long time people put their trust in me. Mr Doherty was hosting a drive through bingo event last week when he got a phone call to say he had won the Foyle Pride award. I just burst out crying, he admitted. I really didnt expect it so I was just overwhelmed. googletag.cmd.push I just have so much gratitude for the award and for everyone who nominated me and I want to thank them all. Mr Doherty said he wished his late mum, Cathy, could have been there on Saturday to see him receive his award. Its hard to accept that my mammy couldnt be there, he said. Its just not the same without her but I am still filled with so much gratitude for it, he said. Derry LGBT+ campaigner, Suzanna Toland, who passed away earlier this year, was remembered at Saturdays ceremony. It was really nice to see Suzanna recognised for everything that she did, said Micky. She was a very special person.Before she passed away she had set up an LGBT+ disco at Rosie Joes so that people would have a safe place to socialise.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This is the message from Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council after a number of incidents over the weekend. At Benone Strand,a large amount of cans and broken bottles were left close to the beach boardwalk, while glass was also found on the sand at Castlerock along with discarded belongings and other items including plastic bottles and bags. There are concerns that groups are congregating to use beaches and dunes as ‘drinking dens’.  Council wants to remind everyone that there isa zero tolerance approach to littering, with offenders facing an pound Fixed Penalty Notice. Those found drinking illegally can also face further enforcement action. googletag.cmd.push Condemning the recent spate of incidents, the Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council Alderman Mark Fielding said: “I want to appeal directly to anyone who visited our coastal locations at the weekend. What did you do with your rubbish  Did you think it was acceptable to leave it behind  Did you expect someone  to clean it up for you  Litter is proving to be a huge challenge at this time, and we need everyone to take more responsibility. “Our beaches are one of our greatest assets and they are there for everyone’s enjoyment. Leaving broken glass where it can injure visitors,childrenandpets is adisgracefulact.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level. We wish our GCSE girls the best of luck for tomorrowrsquos results.Castlewellanrsquos St Malachyrsquos High School said it was pleased with Education Minister Peter Weirrsquos announcement that AS and A level students will receive their centre assessment grades or the grade awarded by the examining body, whichever is higher.ldquoWe continue to work hard in St Malachyrsquos in the best interests of all our young people, said a statement issued on Monday evening. We are all here in St Malachyrsquos to help and support our students in the best way we can. Congratulations on their wonderful achievements we wish them all the very best in the future.De La Salle High School principal Ciaran Maguire described the past academic year for students as ldquochallenging.He said students adhered to social distancing guidelines collecting their results last Thursday, with the school delighted with their overall grades.ldquoA-Level results across the province has been one of confusion and uncertainty, said Mr Maguire.ldquoWe as a school were relieved that the majority of the teacher assessment grades were secured for our pupils and will continue to appeal and challenge those that need to be addressed to ensure that all pupils get the right outcome, allowing them to progress in an ever changing world.Before Mondayrsquos announcement, Mr Mark Morgan, principal at St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, said the continued year on year improvement in grades from the students appeared to have been curtailed by the examination bodies.He said teacher predicted grades, which were in line with all the tracking data, appeared to have been totally ignored and grades were given that bore no reflection to the historic and contemporaneous standard attained by students at the school.St Maryrsquos High School in Downpatrick congratulated its A-Level and AS-Level students who received their results.The school said the studentsrsquo success was a ldquoreflection of their hard work, determination to succeed and dedicated teaching staff who always go the extra mile.ldquoOur steady, upward trend in examination results has continued this year and we wish our students all the very best as they begin their studies at university, the statement added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 53.jpg","title":"53 dogs put down in past year – one third of all in NI  ","story":"A LOCAL politician says she is ldquoheartbroken that more dogs being put to sleep in Newry, Mourne and Down than any other council area in Northern Ireland.Fty-three dogs were destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down in - out of a total of  for the whole province.Thatrsquos almost twice as many as the next highest area, which is Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon with .By contrast six councils reported single figure death rates, while not a single dog was put to sleep in Ards and North Down.Rowallane area councillor Kathryn Owen says the figure for Newry, Mourne and Down makes for ldquogrim reading.Cllr Owen, who has four dogs, says the council should look to the successful measures being implemented in other council areas.ldquoTo say Irsquom heartbroken about the immense number of dogs destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down District would be an understatement, she said.ldquoThis is not a statistic that we should be proud of.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.Ms Armstrong said the local community previously stood together to save Exploris and would do so again.She added: ldquoI would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal for Belfast could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland, with city planners recommending that the new development should be given the green light.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time posts created when it opens its doors, subject to securing planning approval.The aquarium would be a two-storey building, based across more than , sq ft and include a cafe, coral reef ocean tank, with the main exhibition space across five zones on the first floor ndash themed as Ireland, Deep Ocean, Azores, Pacic and Arctic.Around  representations were received in relation to the planning application, including  letters of objection.Concerns included the impact to traffic and travel, the impact on heritage for both listed buildings and monuments, flooding and the potential negative impact on the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry.Those behind the planned tourist attraction say it is anticipated the reefLIVE Aquarium will be the largest marine-le visitor attraction on the island of Ireland and in bringing another international-standard attraction to the Titanic Quarter, would help to boost theof tourist visits to the city.In recommending the scheme for approval, Belfast City Council planners said that ldquohaving regard to the development plan and other material considerations, including the issues raised by the representation, the proposal is considered and approval of planning permission is recommended with delegated authority given to the director of planning and building control to finalise the wording of conditions subject to no new substantive planning issues being raised by third parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 Celebrations.jpg","title":"Celebrations to mark the end of WW2  ","story":"CHURCH bells rang out across Killyleagh on Saturday morning to mark the th anniversary of VJ Day.The bells of St Johnrsquos Church of Ireland were tolled as part of the UK-wide commemorations of the anniversary.The day when the Second World War finally ended was celebrated with a short interdenominational act of remembrance at the War Memorial.At am former Army chaplain Hector Wanliss gave a ure reading and led prayers of thanksgiving for the men of Killyleagh, Shrigley and district who went to war, and for peace.Then Last Post and Reveille were sounded by Ronnie Cromie and Wilmer Cromie before two minutesrsquo silence was observed and Binyonrsquos Lines were recited by Billy Croskery, the chairman of Killyleagh and Killinchy Royal British Legion.A wreath was then laid by Mr Croskery, who was escorted by Kevin Kelly.Sadly Killyleaghrsquos last remaining Second World War veteran, Martin `Tinarsquo Charters, who is aged , was not able to take part on this occasion.Social distancing measures were in place and the organisers are grateful for those who attended adhering to these.It was a timely reminder that the main highlight of the year, the Killyleagh VE  celebrations, had to be cancelled in May by the Killyleagh Remembers the War group in the wake of the Coronavirus alert and the danger of public gatherings.The Killyleagh group has now cancelled its next proposed event, a lecture on the Second World War in the library due to be given by author George Busby on September .ldquoWe will be keeping under review the remaining schedule of the programme, in conjunction with the Heritage Lottery Fund.

Through dancing, a toddler will learn from the early age about what their bodies are capable of, she says.ldquo At the same time, it will build their curiosity as naturally they will experiment with certain movements. If toddlers have been introduced to dancing since early age, the chance of them developing good kinesthetic memory is increased.ldquoDuring class we work on key skills such as counting and sequencing thus subtlety engaging with numeracy and literacy. We incorporate sensory props such as ribbons, scarfs, feathers, bubbles and each dancer brings their own favourite toy to dance with.

This time Ardal McMahon provided the finish as they reached the water break.The RGU management team were left with plenty to ponder. Downpatrick continued to battle after the resumption, determined not to be hit by the threat of an avalanche of Rostrevor scores.At this stage there looked to be a real danger that Rostrevor would cut loose. To their credit, Downpatrick did not throw in the towel.Caolan Mooney burst through on the Downpatrick goal not long before half-time and a penalty was awardedwhen he was up-ended by goalkeeper Deeny. Shaun Parr stepped up and netted Rostrevorrsquos third goal.Downpatrick were given a glimmer of hope just before the interval when Parr and then Sean Cooper were black-carded.However at half-time, and the score at - to -, Downpatrickrsquos task looked onerous.The RGU came out with the right attitude to mount a revival in the second half and Doylersquos early minor reduced the gap.Chris Magee helped lead the Downpatrick forward linersquos continuing assaults on the Rostrevor goal with a couple of scores.

Guided by the experience of Mooney, they stretched their lead before the next water break.Downpatrick were awarded a penalty with the scoreboard reading - to -. However when Rostrevor needed a big moment at just the right time, goalkeeper Gareth Clarke provided it, plunging to push Tim Prenterrsquos effort to safety.That was the moment which really deflated Downpatrickrsquos resolve. You sensed that Rostrevor knew they had weathered the best that Downpatrick could summon in response to their deficit.Jordan Fegan then broke away in the closing minutes, before splitting the posts and taking Rostrevorrsquos score to -.Kane applied a classy coup de grace with the final score of the evening for the victors when he spun the Downpatrick defence and, bearing down on goal, took the safe option of landing the point.In the end it looked plain sailing on paper for Rostrevor. Certainly in terms of the opening they made to the match, catching the RGU cold, they laid the foundations early that kept many of the worries away that Downpatrick could spring a result on them.To Downpatrickrsquos credit, after that disappointing early start, there were more than enough signs there that the spirit within the camp to dig in and get themselves out of trouble in games is there.Downpatrick: James Deeny, Paddy Smith, Ronan Murphy, Eoin Rooney, Nathan McShane, Gerdie Collins, Conor Doherty, Damian Turley, Jonny Bell, Tim Prenter , Conor McGrady , Conor McCarron , Ruairi Quinn , Peter Turley , Chris Magee .Subs: Jarlath Brannigan , Morgan Fitzpatrick, Caolan Boyd, Damian Branf, Daniel McCarron, Garrett Trainor, Ruairi Og Quinn, Frank Starkey, Tom Savage, Tim Collins, Aidan McNeill, Con Farrell, Aidan Og Robinson.Rostrevor: Gareth Clarke, Jarlath Farrell, Tomas Gordon, Eoin Murdock, Nicky Murray, Colm Murney, James Donaghy, Sean Cooper, Caolan Mooney , Ardghal McMahon , Jordan Fegan , Patrick Magee, Conor Doyle , Shaun Parr, Piaras Kane .Subs: Paul McGrath, Richie Reynolds, Darren McElhinney, Conall Gordon, Eamon McConville.

Baraclough did not expect that his announcement would be tarnished by the decision of one of Northern Ireland’s emerging players, Mark Sykes, to switch allegiance to the Republic of Ireland.The midfielder, who plays in the third tier of English football for Oxford United, was previously involved in three international squads, but had not yet made a first team appearance.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Owen PolleySykes’ decision is particularly galling for the Irish FA, which runs Northern Ireland football, because he was a product of the association’s youth teams.He represented his country at multiple levels, even when he plied his trade in the Irish League, taking advantage of the IFA’s Club NI system for developing elite players. One of Michael O’Neill’s achievements was that he seemed to have stemmed the flow of footballers defecting to the Republic. Partly, that was due to the success of his team, which qualied for the European Championship in  and then twice made the play-offs for major tournaments. However, O’Neill’s formidable powers of persuasion were also a major factor.He took care to talk to young players who were at risk of being poached by the southern football authorities.In  he addressed rumours that QPR forward Paul Smyth had been approached by the Football Association of Ireland.The FAI pursue “one type of player: Catholic,” O’Neill alleged.“You could argue that’s sectarian in terms of... recruitment.”As an example he cited Northern Ireland’s midfielder, Paddy McNair.“The FAI thought he must be a Catholic, and when they found out he was a Protestant, they stayed away from it.”Under FIFA’s rules, any player who is eligible for Northern Ireland is also entitled to play for the Republic, unless they have already played competitively for the first-team.In the south, and among many northern nationalists, this is viewed as a right underpinned by citizenship and identity. Northern Ireland fans believe it puts their team at a disadvantage that may be unique in world football. When the IFA challenged the Republic’s interpretation of the rules at the Court of Arbitration of Sport , they lost their case, on the basis that the player in question, Daniel Kearns, was a dual national.His Irish citizenship entitled him to represent the Republic and he qualied for Northern Ireland because, just like the majority of people who are born here, he held automatic British citizenship.Ironically, the rules that enable the FAI to select Northern Irish players rest on an interpretation of British citizenship law that nationalist parties are campaigning to change. Regardless of these details, FIFA has shown consistently that it will not address Northern Ireland’s grievance. Footballers from Northern Ireland will remain eligible to play for the Republic for the foreseeable future.Effectively, the IFA has accepted this regrettable situation and has decided to manage it as best it can. It will continue to make its setup attractive, welcoming and representative of the whole of Northern Ireland, in contrast to the Republic’s selection strategy, which threatens to build a form of football apartheid on the island. The IFA, though, might find its arguments gain more traction when it comes to players switching allegiance after they have played for international youth teams.Ian Baraclough expressed justiable frustration that resources that could have been used to nurture another talented youngster were wasted on Sykes.“He may just have taken that opportunity away ,” the manager noted. Unlike the eligibility situation, this problem isn’t unique to Northern Ireland either. Appropriately, the Republic had its own high-profile defector, Declan Rice, who decided to play for England, after taking advantage of the Irish youth system.The media are now speculating about the future of Liverpool’s Welsh defender, Neco Williams, who is still eligible to switch to England.To prevent international football becoming a farce, FIFA could change its rules so that players are tied to their country after they compete for its under- team.At the very least, when young footballers change their allegiance at this late stage, the association that developed them should be entitled to some compensation.Unfortunately, the authorities that run football are rarely drawn in the direction of good sense. Rather than tightening up its rules, FIFA is discussing allowing players to play three senior competitive games for their country, before they’re prevented from switching to another team. At the moment, they are tied to an association after one competitive first-team game.If anything, it looks like the integrity of international football is likely to be degraded further, and Ian Baraclough’s job will only become harder.– Owen Polley is a unionist writer and commentatorRamore restaurant row: Stephen Nolan wondershealth workers effectively banned from all restaurantsEARLIER THIS SUMMER:Gerry Adams declares Bobby Storey a ‘selfless’ and ‘gentle’ man as large crowd gathers for funeralBlack Lives Matter advocate says DUP MP ‘must recognise his role in an overall system of anti-black oppression’________________________A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

 years onMr Evans, of Cardigan in West Wales, but now living in Brecon, said: ldquoIrsquod taken a call back in  to check my availability for a small comedy for BBC Three and set in South Wales.ldquoI met up with Christine Gernonand Ruth Jonesat the Castell Mynach pub near Llantrisant one afternoon to discuss the script and the locations they wanted me to scout.ldquoAn hour or so after the meeting, I got the call from the production company Baby Cow offering me the job.ldquoMy first task was to sit with Dave Ferrisand discuss the vision for Gavin  Staceyrsquos backdrop and get a feel for the key locations.ldquoStaceyrsquos hometown was scripted as a South Wales coastal town, but I was given a free run on this so the hunt took me to Aberavon, Porthcawl, Tenby, Saundersfoot, and Weston-super-Mare - a cheatit had been suitable.ldquoBack in  there were a few areas in Barry which were beginning to look a little tired, but it also came with a timeless charm that provided us with the perfect texture and feel that Dave and I had discussed.ldquoAdded to this was the welcome we were given by residents and, in particular, the support of the local council.ldquoPorthcawl was also a serious candidate for the backdrop to this show, but having scouted tirelessly the whole of Barry and Barry Island, I knew that this ticked every box.Mr Evans said Trinity Street was an instant favourite.ldquoI knew Gwenrsquos house was here, he said. ldquoThe terraced houses on a steep hill and its far-reaching views over to Barry Island and docks meant that no matter which direction the camera was pointing, there would be interesting textures and views.ldquoThe next objective was to get inside as many houses as possible to seeany worked for us as Gwenrsquos house.ldquoI letter dropped about  houses to gauge the interest.ldquoIrsquod heard that Matt Lucas was going to be involved so I used his name get to my foot in the door.ldquoThis usually helps.ldquoIn those days very few had heard of James Corden.ldquoI viewed and took pictures of about five houses on that street and Glendarsquos who was one of the first to contact me.ldquoThe decor and character of Glendarsquos house fitted my brief perfectly, but my first thought was that house was a little on the small side.ldquoTo get a film crew and the actors to work in such a tight space would be quite a challenge, butI could convince our director and designer that it could be achieved Gwenrsquos house was found.ldquoI took Dave and Christine along to Trinity Street and both fell in love with the location within minutes.Mr Evans continued: ldquoGlenda was so accommodating.ldquoI remember very well discussing with her the details of how filming on location works, how disruptive the whole process can be and also the location fee.ldquoWhat I do remember was her reaction when I mentioned the amount.ldquoGlendarsquos reply was: ldquoIrsquom so sorry Clive, but I donrsquot think I can cover that.ldquoGlenda thought that she needed to pay for the privilege of having us there and not the other way round.ldquoShe is a lovely lady and still loves being a part of the Gavin  Stacey world.During the locationsrsquo breakdown meeting, we discussed how Pam and Mickrsquos house might look in Billericay so homes were viewed in and around Llandaff and Sully until Dinas Powys was selected thanks to the welcome that was received.ldquoSt Cattwgrsquos Church at Llanmaes was not the first-choice wedding venue for Gavin and Stacey, Mr Evans said. ldquoThey were due to be married at St Nicholas Church at the village of St Nicholas, but a last-minute change of heart by the Church in Wales meant that we needed to find an alternative at the th hour.ldquoA friend and another locations manager called Chris Hill pulled in a favour and we were able to use St Cattwgrsquos.ldquoI dont recall any candidates other than Island Leisure .ldquoWhile filming on the front, Marco opening up early for the crew to be able to get a nice coffee as the weather was pretty unkind.ldquoWe didnt use the interior of the coffee shop as a location in series one, but as it was so cold when we filmed on the seafront the coffees were very welcome.ldquoWe also filmed at the Vale of Glamorgan Resort for the exterior of the wedding fair.ldquoThe interior was shot at the Copthorne Hotel at Culverhouse Cross.ldquoWhile at the Vale resort, the Wales rugby team came into the reception of the hotel.ldquoRuth Jones askedIrsquod be able to set up a photograph of the cast with the Welsh team.ldquoWe got them to agree so out there somewhere are pictures of the Gavin  Stacey cast with the Wales rugby team.ldquoUncle Brynrsquos house was only an exterior in series one so very little was involved in its search.ldquoQuiz night at the Colcot Arms was interesting.ldquoWe were close to completing our filming when the pub opened to the public - so the last few shots took a little while longer than wersquod planned.Mr Evans lives with his we Rhiannon and daughter Cerys Mim and runs his own Film and TV Facilities company.He added: ldquoThe actors usually donrsquot get to see the locations beforehand.ldquoThey are brought to set, run through a quick rehearsal then go for the real thing.ldquoThey then have to go through the whole thing over and over with the camera shooting from dferent angles.ldquoIt is a slow process and  hours on camera gives us around three minutes of footage.ldquoI get a real buzz from seeing locations that I have found on TV, but when it comes to Gavin  Stacey the story I always bring up is that while scouting in the very early days with the series producer in the car he askedI would consider reading for Dave.ldquoMy le could have been so dferent, but I have no regrets as no-one could have played it better than Steffan Rhodri.ldquoMy daughter Cerys Mim was born during filming and James Corden was the first to congratulate me when I ed to work on the show after her birth.ldquoHe joked about us naming her Nessa or Stacey.ldquoBarry and the Vale have always provided me with a fantastic hunting ground for film and TV locations.ldquoIts a huge contributor to South Wales becoming a hotspot for filming in the last decade or so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPoliticsQuestions asked over Lord Mayor’s decisionA Portadown councillor has called on Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s Chief Executive and legal team to investigate the Lord Mayor’s interpretation of a standing order.By The NewsroomWednesday, th August , : pm\"\"The call for clarity was made during August’s monthly meeting of Council by DUP councillor, Darryn Causby.It follows a decision made by the Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage, during June’s monthly meeting of Council to rule a motion relating to the naming of the South Lake LeisureCentre ‘improper’ and decide that it would not be debated.During discussion of his decisionon the night, the Lord Mayor made it clear he had not taken legal advice but had discussed his decision with his Sinn Fein party colleagues.Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson also confirmed that he was only made aware of the decision just as the meeting was beginning and as such, legal advice was not produced.Speaking at August’s monthly meeting, Cllr Causby said he believed the Lord Mayor did not have the authority to act as he did and asked for clarication to ensure such actions are not repeated.“I want to raise a point of order Lord Mayor,” said Cllr Causby. “It refers to standing order .. which is the standing order you used when deciding not to allow a motion placed on the agenda for our meeting in June to be heard.“You interpreted the standing order in an interesting way. I have checked and reading through the standing orders I don’t believe you had the authority to do what you did,you read the standing orders in the correct context.“In terms of the standing order it is for the reporting officer to determinea notice of motion is lawful or improper. The Chief Executive is our officer in that regard and he considered the motion and included it in the agenda for the meeting.“You then took the decision, unilaterally, to not have it heard during the meeting.”Councillor Causby asked for the matter to be investigated to clarythe Lord Mayor acted within the bounds of his authority.“My ask is that the Chief Executive and Council’s legal team investigate the eighth edition of’Knowles on Local Authority Meetings’ as it details the proper protocol, it is the guide and case law,” said the DUP representative.“I want to ensure that we get proper clarity to prevent a decision like from being taken again.”Speaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service after the meeting, Councillor Causby said this call has nothing to do with the decision taken on the naming of the South Lakes Leisure Centre, rather ensuring that the office of the Lord Mayor remains removed from partisan politics.“With regards to the decision taken on the name of the leisure centre, what is done, is done,” said Cllr Causby.“We are not going to overturn that decision, it has already been made. I just want to ensure a moment like this does not happen again.“The standing order the Lord Mayor quoted is ... It concerns motions that are unlawful or improper. The Lord Mayor called the motion improper but that was not his call to make.“Council Baxter should have been informed of the decision prior to the meeting but he was not, nor was the Chief Executive, the Lord Mayor told us on the night he had informed his party colleagues.“He acted outside the process, outside standing orders and, in my view, quite improperly.”When asked about the process of the investigation, a Council spokesperson said “no comment could be made on the matter”.“In line with legislation, a notice of motion is subject to a call-in periodand no comment can be made on the matter until the call-in period has lapsed,” the spokesperson said.“In this case, as legal advice on the interpretation of the standing order is to be provided, it would also be subject to legal privilege.”Read our coverage of the original debate hereA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Over my years as principal, we have had great support from the club and some of our past pupils have gone on to represent their county.For me, the notable achievement has been to see the way in which past pupils have progressed in a iety of chosen careers and been successful in so many walks of le.Another achievement is the way in which the staff both past and present have worked together as a team to have accomplished so many things over the past  years, not least to have been awarded Outstanding in our last inspection report.The development of the St. Cairealls Community Playschool on the school site has also brought me great joy over the past ten years to see it now as a successful pre-school provider with DENI status and funding for our local children.Having spent so many years of my le in St Cairealls P.S., it has become a second home and the staff and pupils a second family. Retiring for me brings mixed emotions. However , I am looking forward to having more time to spend with my family, my husband Kevin, our daughters Emer, Niamh and Fionnuala and their partners. Also our son Michael and his partner and my two precious grandsons Micheal and Braidan. Mrs McHugh concluded: I want to offer good wishes to the future of this very special school – St. Cairealls Primary School, Aghyaran and success and happiness to my successor, Mrs Michelle Ellis.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:    n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cffeaa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ecdaadf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1598431969897.jpg--post_primary_pupils_now_to_wear_face_coverings_in_corridors.jpg?159843197000","title":"post primary pupils now to wear face coverings in corridors ","story":"Education Minister Peter Weir has announced that guidance on face coverings will be updated to include wearing them in corridors of post-primary schools. This will come into effect on  August when schoolson a full-time basis. The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. “In relation to communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible. “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir said: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperature a new, continuous cough a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.” The Department’s New School Day Guidance will be updated to reflect this recommendation.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cffeaa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ecdaadf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
