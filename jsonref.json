But what is Martin Lewis’s net worth?Who is Martin Lewis?Born Martin Steven Lewis on May 9, 1972 in Withington, Manchester, he is an English financial journalist and founder of the website MoneySavingExpert.com.He lost his mother in a car accident at a young age and later in life, went on to become a patron of the children’s bereavement charity Grief Encounter as well as an advocate for life insurance.Martin studied government and law at the London School of Economics and went on to complete a postgraduate course in broadcast journalism in Cardiff.His first job was at a financial communications consultancy, the Brunswick Group in London and later, became a producer for the BBC Business Unit working on BBC Radio Five Live business programmes.Martin was also an editor of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme and then moved to Sky’s Simply Money where he formed his Money Saving Expert persona.After the collapse of Simply Money, he wrote for the Deal of the Week column in the Sunday Express and was then granted slots on Channel 5’s Open House with Gloria Hunniford.Martin returned to BBC for a short while before presenting a daytime television series on ITV in 2005 called Make Me Rich as well as Channel Five show It Pays to Watch.He then presented money saving programmes on Good Morning Britain and Lorraine and now appears on This Morning, The Wright Stuff and began presenting The Martin Lewis Money Show.Martin Lewis is married to former 5 News weather presenter Lara Lewington in May 31, 2009 and the couple had a daughter in November 2012.          Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis pictured with his Order of the British Empire (OBE) medal alongside his wife Lara Lewington at an Investiture ceremony in February 2015 at Buckingham PalaceMartin Lewis on Question TimeMoney Saving Expert Martin Lewis was applauded by Question Time viewers after he slammed Labour Party MP Chi Onwurah over student finance claims.He accused politicians of dissuading young people from attending university by referring to the fee payments as student ‘debt’ and said that an entire generation had been ‘mis-educated’.He said: \u0027It is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame... It\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Martin explained that the price of attending university was irrelevant and the repayments are based on salary, which means that those who earn a lot after completing their studies, will naturally have to pay back more.Ms Onwurah, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central said: \u0027If somebody, and particularly somebody from a working class background, if somebody has 57,000 in debt,\u0027 but Martin interrupted her to say: ‘Don\u0027t tell them! Politicians do this all the time. You can\u0027t make political points.\u0027You put off young people from underprivileged backgrounds from going to university with a fear of debt by framing it as a debt when you know it doesn\u0027t work like that.\u0027Politicians need to take responsibility. Your political football that you and all the parties have used student finance to be has mis-educated a generation about how student finance works and it is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame because there are people from poor backgrounds on television - I saw a programme two weeks ago - saying I can\u0027t afford to go to university.\u0027Well, you know what, it is expensive, it\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Ms Onwurah responded: \u0027It is really, really important to recognise that tuition fees are an obstacle for students going into university. It\u0027s psychological but a lot of the world is psychological. How things are perceived is what informs people\u0027s choice.\u0027You can argue to re-educate, or you can argue, as we have done, to abolish tuition fees.\u0027Martin Lewis suing FacebookIn April 2018, Money Saving Expert founder Martin Lewis revealed that he is in the process of suing Facebook for publishing dozens of adverts using his image to promote scams.He said that the social media platform had used his name to ‘rip off vulnerable people’. He continued: \u0027I feel sick each time I hear of another victim being conned because of trust they wrongly thought they were placing in me.‘I believe politicians have totally missed the impact of social media companies on real people and their pockets. It is about time they took this seriously.’Martin went on to say that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg ‘pretends to be an honest and campaigning man but his company is a facilitator of criminal scammers … They have known about these scam adverts for years, and they are still happy to roll around in their dirty money.’Facebook has been accused of publishing more than 50 fake Martin Lewis adverts, with the majority promoting schemes trading in Bitcoin, which Martin claimed were actually binary trading firms.Binary trading is a risky form of gambling on the stock market that sees most investors lose money.The Financial Conduct Authority has said almost 100 firms are illegally offering such investments to UK consumers and warned of online firms that take money, place no bets for customers then break contact.Martin has asked Facebook to remove the adverts multiple times but they are left up for days or weeks before being taken down and then reappear days later.A Facebook spokesman said: ‘We do not allow adverts which are misleading or false on Facebook and have explained to Martin Lewis he should report any adverts that infringe his rights and they will be removed.’Martin Lewis net worthMartin Lewis’s net worth has accumulated to approximately £73 million, according to Wealtholino.In 2012, BBC News reported that Martin sold MoneySavingExpert.com for up to £87 million.Marvel character searches on Pornhub surged before Avengers: Infinity War releaseJennifer Aniston joins Brad Pitt and others in objecting to The Weinstein Company saleGrey\u0027s Anatomy preview hints at Sarah Drew and Jessica Capshaw\u0027s leavingCinco de Mayo: How to celebrate in style Who is Matthew Lawrence?

The mast was broken, the sails in shreds and the boat itself flooded with water.The British towns where VEG has almost vanished... and why...We had to tell our children Daddy could die on Everest... we...Share this articleWhat followed was a story of good fortune, rare courage, and redemption. For more than 40 days, with her boat crippled, equipment smashed and heart broken, 23-year-old Tami somehow endured the elements threatening to annihilate her and then conquered them – and she did so thanks to the guiding spirit of her dead fiancé, whose insistent voice, day by day, had urged her on to a seemingly impossible survival.That voice, she says, brought her back from the brink, helping her navigate with just a sextant and the stars above her head.Now her ordeal and the extraordinary memoir that followed have been made into a big-budget Hollywood film, Adrift, set for release in June, and featuring British actor Sam Claflin as Richard and Shailene Woodley as Tami.Both are rising stars – Sam appeared in the film adaptation of Jojo Moyes’ novel Me Before You, while US actress Shailene played a teenage cancer patient in The Fault In Our Stars – and Adrift looks set to be this summer’s cinematic hit.Yet even the big-screen treatment could hardly be more dramatic than the true 1,500-mile solo epic that Tami describes in Red Sky In Mourning: A True Story of Love, Loss And Survival At Sea, which will be re-published next month as Adrift.It was September 1983 when the two young sailors embarked on what they imagined to be a routine delivery for the Hazana’s British owners, Peter and Christine Compton.At 34, Richard was more than a decade older than his young American lover, but with his his lapis lazuli eyes, golden hair and ‘exotic’ English accent, he meant everything to her. They had already spent a year and a half together on the Pacific, delivering and mending boats.True, the distance involved in this new mission was vast, yet the pair had few concerns, as Tami later recalled in a series of moving interviews: ‘I’d been sailing blue water for four years. Together we had 50,000 miles of ocean-sailing under our belts. We hugged, laughed, made love and relaxed into 20 days of paradise.’          The couple set off on the 4,000 mile trip on board the Hazana across the Pacific OceanA disastrous reality was less than two weeks away, in the shape of tropical storm Raymond, which ‘tore out of the blue’, hit hurricane force then held its peak intensity for two catastrophic days.It was Richard who spotted a monster wave approaching the Hazana and ordered Tami below deck while he secured himself with a safety harness and tried to keep the vessel afloat.Moments later she heard him scream ‘Oh my God!’ and her world was thrust into darkness.Tossed like a cork on the raging ocean, the yacht had flipped end over end. It was 27 hours before she regained consciousness to an eerie silence and utter devastation. The cabin was half-filled with water, everything inside it smashed or scattered on the floor.Scrambling out onto the deck she looked desperately for Richard but found only wreckage. The boat was all-but destroyed: masts were broken off and the waterlogged sails floated uselessly in the water.Richard’s safety line dangled ominously off the boat. Tami shouted his name over and over again, but found only empty ocean. Richard was nowhere to be seen.

Andy Perry is believed to be the first Brit to lose an entire leg from a spider bite, after he almost died when the creature sank its fangs into his ankleAfter numerous appointments with specialists Andy opted for an elective amputation above his right knee, which was carried out in March.He has now been left wheel-chair bound, unable to work or play with his children and needs daily treatment.Andy, of Huncote, Leicestershire, who lives with his police officer wife Christine, 39, said: \u0027I was doing a quote for a job in 2015 and I was coming home at lunchtime to look after the kids because my wife was on shift.\u0027But within a couple of hours I started feeling really poorly. I rang the missus to see if she could come home but she couldn\u0027t and the next I know I got a massive ache in the small of my back.\u0027That was pretty much me done then and Christine came back home when I called her again.          Mr Perry\u0027s leg is pictured three weeks before the amputation. He said the pain was so severe he considered sawing it off \u0027I went to bed when she got back, pretty much for the whole weekend and I was throwing up.\u0027Then on the Sunday morning it was a question of having to get over to the hospital as soon as I could.\u0027I was seen by a doctor in the Royal Leicester Infirmary Triage and he said there was no chance of me going home.\u0027Then he admitted me straight away, the ache in my back was the kidney\u0027s packing up from the infection and sepsis.

Mr Perry\u0027s leg is pictured following the amputation he was forced to undergo when the spider bit his ankle \u0027They came to a conclusion it was a false widow spider because it has a reputation of biting people.\u0027The puncture marks were just above the sock line because I used to wear socks and boots.\u0027The only thing we can think of is that I literally just brushed past it and its had a quick bite as I\u0027ve gone past.\u0027Apparently the bite of the false widow feels like a bee sting but I didn\u0027t feel a thing. The spiders are an awful lot more common than people think.\u0027After they sorted out the kidney function, things started improving and the sepsis was beaten by the anti-biotics.          Mr Perry (pictured before the bite with his son Tom) is believed to be the first Brit to have a leg amputated due to a false widow bite\u0027I\u0027ve had the district nurses coming around for the next three months changing the dressing on my leg every day.\u0027The lymphedema caused the leg to swell to the point where the skin split and fell off.\u0027That was all just a massive open weeping sores and blisters and just generally horribleness.\u0027And that was it, the leg was all but useless from that point, I spent a certain amount of time trying to get treatment.\u0027There just wasn\u0027t a surgeon nearby who wanted to touch it because of the lymphedema as it was a live infection.\u0027So without getting any treatment I just couldn\u0027t work - so I figured I would go down the route of elective amputation in a last desperate attempt to get back to work.          Andy had no idea he had been bitten by Britain\u0027s most venomous spider until he was rushed to hospital suffering from sepsis and kidney failure\u0027But again trying to find a doctor or surgeon to look at the amputation was hard.\u0027Eventually I had to threaten my GP with cutting my own leg off with a blade from a chainsaw because I was getting so desperate.\u0027Out of that I tried a guy in Coventry who climbed on board straight away as soon as he saw the leg.\u0027I spent 20 minutes talking to him, needed a second opinion and spoke to prosthetic people and as soon as that was done it was all agreed.\u0027The leg was cut of on March 13 of this year, it should\u0027ve been healed by now but I got a secondary infection so I was back in surgery on April 27.\u0027I\u0027ve now got a vacuum dressing on me which pulls all of the gulp out of the leg and takes it away.          The father-of-two has spoken of his horror after he fell seriously ill after being bitten by a false widow spider\u0027The plan is to rehabilitate the leg, get a prosthetic and get back to work for this year or next.\u0027I had been a landscaper for about five years prior to the bite and I had a good business going on but now its all gone.\u0027We\u0027ve been living off my wife\u0027s salary - I have got zero income because of this bite.\u0027Andy is now hoping to get help to fix up his garden so he can play with his children Thomas, 8, and George, 5.He added: \u0027They\u0027ve been brilliant, they\u0027ve taken it in their stride, we have explained every single thing about whats happened all the way along. I can\u0027t use the garden, I\u0027m just complete and utterly stuck\u0027I\u0027ve been looking for help with my new project which is sorting out his garden to make it more wheelchair friendly.          Mr Perry was rushed to hospital suffering from sepsis and kidney failure and had to have his leg amputated \u0027I\u0027ve now realised that our garden is horribly unsuitable for my wheelchair.. My chair is great but it doesn\u0027t like grass.\u0027It is a small garden and it\u0027s laid mostly to lawn and soft landscaping but there is a large raised deck that I installed to overcome the slopes in the garden.\u0027I can barely get outside let alone use the deck so I\u0027m restricted to an area of 1.5 square metre.\u0027I\u0027ve contacted lots of builders yards in the hopes of securing donations of materials. I can\u0027t afford to buy the items which I think will cost around £4,500.\u0027I know it is a long shot but I\u0027m hoping to raise donations of materials and then I\u0027m hoping to find friends and tradesmen willing to help out by doing the work, a kind of Ground Force, DIY SOS thing, on a local basis.\u0027I just need to get a prosthetic but we don\u0027t think that will be this year - I had promised the boys to take them trick or treating at Halloween but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a possibility now.\u0027The UK has seen a rise in false widow spiders - dubbed Britain\u0027s most venomous spider - in the past four years, believed to be caused by an increase in climate.The influx of the eight-legged beasts has seen a number of unsuspecting Brits hospitalised.The false widow spider is not deadly, but can deliver a similar bite to its antipodean cousin, which can kill within hours.Instead of the venomous black widow spider, which dons devilish black and red markings across its body, the false widow spider in Britain is usually harmless.The Steatoda nobilis is native to Madeira and the Canary islands, and is believed to have arrived on British shores via a cargo transporter in the 19th Century. Andy\u0027s Justgiving page is here. Crowdfunding to Buy an electric wheelchair on

It was then used for storing meteorological records and artists and school groups visited until it was turned into a private residence in the 1980s.The current owners bought it in 2004 and transformed it from the basic accommodation it had been over just the bottom two floors, into the stunning five-storey property it is now.It has 1,216 sq ft of accommodation with two bedrooms and two bathrooms on the ground and first floor and the kitchendiner and lounge on the second and third floors to take advantage of the views.On the fourth floor is the observation deck, which the estate agents describe as \u0027one of the most incredible rooms anywhere in Cornwall\u0027.          On the ground floor of the building there is a useful wet room with modern appliances, shower, loo, sink and modern tiling          There is also a camera obscura in the observatory deck, effectively turning the room into a pinhole camera and projecting the beautiful panoramic views onto a table          The comfortable lounge one floor below the observatory deck affords the inhabitants ample living space and yet more sumptuous viewsIt has windows on all eight walls offering a genuine 360-degree view across Falmouth, the surrounding countryside and coastline, including Falmouth Bay, and across to the Roseland Peninsula, with St Mawes and Pendennis Castles easily seen and lit at night.The room has an oak panelled vaulted roof space leading up to the camera obscura at the apex, which was constructed in the 1950s.It converts the whole room into a pinhole camera when the black-out blinds are drawn and it rotates, allowing the panoramic views to be projected as an image on a table in the observation deck.The owners have recently run the property as a holiday rental and are prepared to sell it with ongoing bookings and its website if the buyer wanted to continue this.All the furniture, linen, cutlery and crockery, light fittings, blinds and artwork are available by separate negotiation.Ian Lillicrap from Lillicrap Chilcott said: \u0027I\u0027ve been an estate agent in Cornwall for 39 years and I can honestly say it\u0027s the most unusual property I have ever dealt with.          The house also features a light and bright compact kitchen with 360 degree windows offering light from every angle around          The house only features two bedrooms in total but they are modern and bright throughout - with the house having been recently renovated          The house\u0027s floorplan shows the unusual layout in more detail - as it is split over five floors but only offers around 113 square meters in living space\u0027And the views from the upper floors and the top are the most spectacular I have ever seen.\u0027It\u0027s like being in a helicopter above Falmouth when you reach the top. It just completely takes your breath away.\u0027It\u0027s glazed on all sides so you get a 360-degree view over Falmouth and for miles surrounding.\u0027It is the sort of vista you just never see.\u0027It\u0027s a well-worn phrase but it truly is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\u0027The craftmanship in this property is spectacular. The beautiful, quality, intricate workmanship and ingenuity, similar to kitting out a superyacht, has been brought into this building.\u0027The flooring, the winding staircases from floor to floor and the way the kitchen has been fitted, it\u0027s all marvellous. The owners have the most incredible eye for detail.\u0027It\u0027s not huge so I don\u0027t think it will sell as a main home but it would be an absolutely prized second home for someone or it could be someone who wants to use it for lettings.\u0027I don\u0027t believe there is anything else resembling it in Cornwall. There\u0027s nothing that comes close in terms of uniqueness and quality.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/19/4BEB962600000578-5697107-image-a-3_1525633080663.jpg","title":"Thousands Cambridge Uni students flock Jesus Park dressed cheerleaders Oompa Loompas","story":"    Off their trolley!

With his characteristic cheerfulness, he’s many times since retold the moment we metSo when I got the phone call five years ago informing me that Andrew had suffered a massive stroke, and his future was, to say the least, tentative, I was floored. Unable to see him for nearly a month due to his condition, I prayed for his recovery. I also tried to help ease his family’s burden by sending weekly food parcels. Over the weeks, I must have cooked gallons of chilli con carne (from my special recipe containing cardamom, coriander, cumin, smoked paprika and, of course, chilli).The aim was to give them more time and the ultimate comfort food after hours of visits to Andrew’s hospital bedside.Beggars could be banned from being within 30ft of cash...McDonald\u0027s, Costa, and KFC are charging up to 28 per cent...Share this article    Andrew Marr (left), Amanda Platell and Charles Kennedy (right), review the papers during the filming of the Andrew Marr ShowDoctors had discovered that he’d torn his carotid artery, causing a massive stroke and putting his life in danger. In his hospital bed, he soon realised that his voracious appetite for work meant that he’d pushed his body and mind too hard.‘I’m a gulper, a gobbler-down of life. I wolf experiences down,’ he later said. Thankfully, the stroke hit the left side of his brain — which meant his memory and speech were not impaired. But it took months of sheer willpower and tough physical rehab exercises – as well as walking, reading and painting – before he was able to go back and present his Sunday morning BBC1 show.          Thankfully, the stroke hit the left side of his brain — which meant his memory and speech were not impairedA rock of granite during all this time was his wife. He says: ‘Jackie saved my life. Without her, I wouldn’t be here. It’s partly because she fought for me she was my tireless advocate in the hospital to get the right treatment.’His friends often joked that he could have lost half his brain and he’d still be cleverer than almost anyone we knew.When Andrew told me last week of this latest health scare – a small tumour on his kidney which was caught early and will be frozen off – I was more sanguine. Yes, we all fear the words ‘tumour’, ‘cancer’ and ‘malignant’. Yet I know that Andrew has more courage and determination in his little finger, even the one hardest hit by the stroke, than most people do in their entire body.Moreover, this no-nonsense Scot would be appalled to be called ‘courageous’. He’s a man without an ounce of self-pity. He would never, ever, ask: ‘Why has this happened to me?’ What I’ve learnt from our friendship is that Andrew has guts. He’s damn stubborn, too.He’s approaching this cancer scare with the same determination he did his stroke.Get on with it and go back to work and normal life.I’m sure that will be the case – and that his family won’t have to endure any more takeaway pans of chilli con carne a la Platell."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/09/0234D4AB000007D0-0-image-a-11_1525594220709.jpg","title":"Duchess York left guest list Meghan Harrys second private wedding reception","story":"    The Duchess of York.

The mast was broken, the sails in shreds and the boat itself flooded with water.The British towns where VEG has almost vanished... and why...We had to tell our children Daddy could die on Everest... we...Share this articleWhat followed was a story of good fortune, rare courage, and redemption. For more than 40 days, with her boat crippled, equipment smashed and heart broken, 23-year-old Tami somehow endured the elements threatening to annihilate her and then conquered them – and she did so thanks to the guiding spirit of her dead fiancé, whose insistent voice, day by day, had urged her on to a seemingly impossible survival.That voice, she says, brought her back from the brink, helping her navigate with just a sextant and the stars above her head.Now her ordeal and the extraordinary memoir that followed have been made into a big-budget Hollywood film, Adrift, set for release in June, and featuring British actor Sam Claflin as Richard and Shailene Woodley as Tami.Both are rising stars – Sam appeared in the film adaptation of Jojo Moyes’ novel Me Before You, while US actress Shailene played a teenage cancer patient in The Fault In Our Stars – and Adrift looks set to be this summer’s cinematic hit.Yet even the big-screen treatment could hardly be more dramatic than the true 1,500-mile solo epic that Tami describes in Red Sky In Mourning: A True Story of Love, Loss And Survival At Sea, which will be re-published next month as Adrift.It was September 1983 when the two young sailors embarked on what they imagined to be a routine delivery for the Hazana’s British owners, Peter and Christine Compton.At 34, Richard was more than a decade older than his young American lover, but with his his lapis lazuli eyes, golden hair and ‘exotic’ English accent, he meant everything to her. They had already spent a year and a half together on the Pacific, delivering and mending boats.True, the distance involved in this new mission was vast, yet the pair had few concerns, as Tami later recalled in a series of moving interviews: ‘I’d been sailing blue water for four years. Together we had 50,000 miles of ocean-sailing under our belts. We hugged, laughed, made love and relaxed into 20 days of paradise.’          The couple set off on the 4,000 mile trip on board the Hazana across the Pacific OceanA disastrous reality was less than two weeks away, in the shape of tropical storm Raymond, which ‘tore out of the blue’, hit hurricane force then held its peak intensity for two catastrophic days.It was Richard who spotted a monster wave approaching the Hazana and ordered Tami below deck while he secured himself with a safety harness and tried to keep the vessel afloat.Moments later she heard him scream ‘Oh my God!’ and her world was thrust into darkness.Tossed like a cork on the raging ocean, the yacht had flipped end over end. It was 27 hours before she regained consciousness to an eerie silence and utter devastation. The cabin was half-filled with water, everything inside it smashed or scattered on the floor.Scrambling out onto the deck she looked desperately for Richard but found only wreckage. The boat was all-but destroyed: masts were broken off and the waterlogged sails floated uselessly in the water.Richard’s safety line dangled ominously off the boat. Tami shouted his name over and over again, but found only empty ocean. Richard was nowhere to be seen.

Andy Perry is believed to be the first Brit to lose an entire leg from a spider bite, after he almost died when the creature sank its fangs into his ankleAfter numerous appointments with specialists Andy opted for an elective amputation above his right knee, which was carried out in March.He has now been left wheel-chair bound, unable to work or play with his children and needs daily treatment.Andy, of Huncote, Leicestershire, who lives with his police officer wife Christine, 39, said: \u0027I was doing a quote for a job in 2015 and I was coming home at lunchtime to look after the kids because my wife was on shift.\u0027But within a couple of hours I started feeling really poorly. I rang the missus to see if she could come home but she couldn\u0027t and the next I know I got a massive ache in the small of my back.\u0027That was pretty much me done then and Christine came back home when I called her again.

Mr Perry\u0027s leg is pictured following the amputation he was forced to undergo when the spider bit his ankle \u0027They came to a conclusion it was a false widow spider because it has a reputation of biting people.\u0027The puncture marks were just above the sock line because I used to wear socks and boots.\u0027The only thing we can think of is that I literally just brushed past it and its had a quick bite as I\u0027ve gone past.\u0027Apparently the bite of the false widow feels like a bee sting but I didn\u0027t feel a thing. The spiders are an awful lot more common than people think.\u0027After they sorted out the kidney function, things started improving and the sepsis was beaten by the anti-biotics.          Mr Perry (pictured before the bite with his son Tom) is believed to be the first Brit to have a leg amputated due to a false widow bite\u0027I\u0027ve had the district nurses coming around for the next three months changing the dressing on my leg every day.\u0027The lymphedema caused the leg to swell to the point where the skin split and fell off.\u0027That was all just a massive open weeping sores and blisters and just generally horribleness.\u0027And that was it, the leg was all but useless from that point, I spent a certain amount of time trying to get treatment.\u0027There just wasn\u0027t a surgeon nearby who wanted to touch it because of the lymphedema as it was a live infection.\u0027So without getting any treatment I just couldn\u0027t work - so I figured I would go down the route of elective amputation in a last desperate attempt to get back to work.          Andy had no idea he had been bitten by Britain\u0027s most venomous spider until he was rushed to hospital suffering from sepsis and kidney failure\u0027But again trying to find a doctor or surgeon to look at the amputation was hard.\u0027Eventually I had to threaten my GP with cutting my own leg off with a blade from a chainsaw because I was getting so desperate.\u0027Out of that I tried a guy in Coventry who climbed on board straight away as soon as he saw the leg.\u0027I spent 20 minutes talking to him, needed a second opinion and spoke to prosthetic people and as soon as that was done it was all agreed.\u0027The leg was cut of on March 13 of this year, it should\u0027ve been healed by now but I got a secondary infection so I was back in surgery on April 27.\u0027I\u0027ve now got a vacuum dressing on me which pulls all of the gulp out of the leg and takes it away.          The father-of-two has spoken of his horror after he fell seriously ill after being bitten by a false widow spider\u0027The plan is to rehabilitate the leg, get a prosthetic and get back to work for this year or next.\u0027I had been a landscaper for about five years prior to the bite and I had a good business going on but now its all gone.\u0027We\u0027ve been living off my wife\u0027s salary - I have got zero income because of this bite.\u0027Andy is now hoping to get help to fix up his garden so he can play with his children Thomas, 8, and George, 5.He added: \u0027They\u0027ve been brilliant, they\u0027ve taken it in their stride, we have explained every single thing about whats happened all the way along.

It was then used for storing meteorological records and artists and school groups visited until it was turned into a private residence in the 1980s.The current owners bought it in 2004 and transformed it from the basic accommodation it had been over just the bottom two floors, into the stunning five-storey property it is now.It has 1,216 sq ft of accommodation with two bedrooms and two bathrooms on the ground and first floor and the kitchendiner and lounge on the second and third floors to take advantage of the views.On the fourth floor is the observation deck, which the estate agents describe as \u0027one of the most incredible rooms anywhere in Cornwall\u0027.          On the ground floor of the building there is a useful wet room with modern appliances, shower, loo, sink and modern tiling          There is also a camera obscura in the observatory deck, effectively turning the room into a pinhole camera and projecting the beautiful panoramic views onto a table          The comfortable lounge one floor below the observatory deck affords the inhabitants ample living space and yet more sumptuous viewsIt has windows on all eight walls offering a genuine 360-degree view across Falmouth, the surrounding countryside and coastline, including Falmouth Bay, and across to the Roseland Peninsula, with St Mawes and Pendennis Castles easily seen and lit at night.The room has an oak panelled vaulted roof space leading up to the camera obscura at the apex, which was constructed in the 1950s.It converts the whole room into a pinhole camera when the black-out blinds are drawn and it rotates, allowing the panoramic views to be projected as an image on a table in the observation deck.The owners have recently run the property as a holiday rental and are prepared to sell it with ongoing bookings and its website if the buyer wanted to continue this.All the furniture, linen, cutlery and crockery, light fittings, blinds and artwork are available by separate negotiation.Ian Lillicrap from Lillicrap Chilcott said: \u0027I\u0027ve been an estate agent in Cornwall for 39 years and I can honestly say it\u0027s the most unusual property I have ever dealt with.

The quadruplets are from a single embryo that split into three, with one of the resulting embryos iding again. Professor Simon Fishel, of CARE Fertility Group, said: ‘We would have to wait several lifetimes to witness something like this again.’When the girls were born, Mr Clark gave up his job as a long-distance lorry driver to help care for them. The couple, who live in Rotherham, decided the only way to bring the quadruplets up was with a strict routine.The sisters get themselves ready for school and help around the house. ‘They will use the vacuum, the steam mop and the polish as well as tidy up their room,’ said Mr Clark, who is now back working as a telecoms field engineer.But like all youngsters, the foursome do occasionally play up. ‘Something has to go wrong sometimes,’ their father added, explaining that their antics have included drawing on their parents’ bed with pink lipstick and breaking a TV while playing with a broomstick.Looking to the future, Mr Clark has made one thing clear: ‘I’ve told them already – they’ll definitely have to pay for their own weddings.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/23/4BED62E200000578-5697573-image-m-74_1525644645170.jpg","title":"Several minority University Florida graduates yanked away walk stage","story":"Video from Saturday\u0027s graduation ceremony at the University of Florida shows a lecturer aggressively yanking several minority students off the stage          The graduates did a celebratory dance as their names were called, prompting the man to forcibly shove them along           Students, parents and alumni took to Twitter to express their outrage           One Twitter user says she almost fell when she was pushed by the faculty memberThroughout Saturday\u0027s two-and-half-hour graduation ceremony the man, who has not been named by the school, is seen hurrying students of all ethnicities along as their names are called.It appears his role was to make sure the students were orderly and swiftly walked across the stage to receive their diplomas.However, he may have been getting impatient near the end as he aggressively grabs and shoves several of male and female students when they stop to do a victory dance.\u0027Trust that inner voice\u0027: Ronan Farrow says his career was...Share this articleThose at the graduation posted video footage on Twitter, sparking outrage as people claimed that he was discriminating and only acted excessively violent with the black students.One Twitter-user wrote: \u0027Every time a Black student took more than TWO seconds, he aggressively pushed them.\u0027An alumni wrote that she is \u0027completely disgraced at the treatment of these students who earned their spot on that stage.\u0027      The school\u0027s president Kent Fuch issued a statement apologizing for the \u0027aggressive\u0027 behavior          One alumni who is also Chancellor at North Carolina A\u0026ampT State raised concerns about the school\u0027s \u0027practice\u0027           It is unclear if any action will be taken by the university against the faculty member"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/19/4BEC076F00000578-0-image-a-23_1525630950695.jpg","title":"McDonalds Costa KFC charge 28 cent coffee motorway service stations","story":"    Breaking up your journey with a coffee stop at a motorway service station?

The black circles – obliterating the entire face of a farmer in North Dakota, the right eye of a woman in Arkansas, or resembling an eclipsed sun hanging in the sky over labourers in Maryland – were created when the negatives were censored in the 1930s by clipping them with a metal punch.Many of the 175,000 photographs in the Farm Security Association archive became defining images of the Great Depression, including Evans’s gaunt sharecropper families, Lange’s portraits of farm women with nothing left except willpower, and Arthur Rothstein’s Fleeing a Dust Storm, a surreal scene of a family fighting to keep their feet in the wind that has already ripped their farm buildings to shreds.However, thousands more images were censored, judged not to meet the strict criteria the photographers had been given for the type of images sought – a tricky brief to show the scale of the problem the association was trying to tackle, but without obliterating all hope. The negatives were mutilated – occasionally several holes were punched to prevent the image being used even in cropped form – but not completely destroyed. The censored and approved images all ended up archived in the Library of Congress, where they have recently been digitised. Nayia Yiakoumaki, the curator of Killed Negatives, spent weeks poring over thumbnail images to choose the 80 photographs in the exhibition. “They were so wonderful,” she said. “It was an almost impossible task, there were thousands I could have used.“I was astonished when I learned of the existence of the rejected negatives. These are photographers and images that I have studied and taught, but I had not realised that the images we know so well were only part of a much larger story.”The images all date from a pioneering project by the FSA, which in the 1930s sent photographers out into fields, homesteads, villages and small towns across America to record the farming communities being ground down by the Great Depression and the efforts being made by the FSA to help them.Although the images often appear as spontaneous photojournalism, the photographers were actually working to a very tight brief, and were given detailed information in advance about their subjects. The briefing note recorded that Steve Doty, of Tangipahoa Parish, whose mule had died and who received a temporary loan for fertiliser for his strawberry crop, had “built a one-room log hut for his family to live in. The cracks have been stuffed with newspapers. Two of his children are in school and the two youngest ones are at home.” A widow and eight children were left destitute when a man died of cerebral cancer after months getting lifts as a charity case for hospital treatment. The youngest child was under three, and 15-year-old Angelina had been left totally blind by typhoid. The 17-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, was the only one able to work, “being able to sew and do canning work very well”. In many cases the contrast between the immaculately turned out people and the shabby surroundings shows clearly that the photographer’s visit was expected and prepared for, but any images that looked too staged were rejected, as were those showing FSA officials.All the photographers sent back their rolls of film to the project director, Roy Stryker, an economist but a photographer himself, who had the approved images printed in his laboratories. Yiakoumaki can see why some images, slightly out of focus, poorly composed or showing the photographer reflected in a window, were rejected – but she can only guess at others. Did the striking black couple photographed by Walker Evans in New York look too smart, confident and urban? Was the group dancing in a circle, described by the photographer Carl Mydans as “healthy children in clean backyard”, just too healthy and too white? And the same photographer’s pair of black children, sitting in a litter-strewn yard in front of a decaying shack, “such is the front yard available to these two youngsters to play in”, too desperate and too black?“These photographs stand as beautiful images in their own right,” Yiakoumaki said, “but the intervention, the very act of destruction has made them into something more, objects which can be seen as works of contemporary art.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99a35d46413120f1e097fa8c60007e9d2f5d4ff9/0_1345_2600_1559/master/2600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bb53c2312d72721fd80f2d214ef2d98","title":"the saltwater people a picture essay","story":"Seventy kilometres, three days, two canoes, one unforgettable adventure. The journey of the Saltwater people of the Gold Coast as documented by photographer David Kelly and narrated by Ben Allmon by Ben Allmon and David KellySeventy kilometres, three days, two canoes, one unforgettable adventure. The journey of the Saltwater people of the Gold Coast as documented by photographer David Kelly and narrated by Ben Allmon by Ben Allmon and David Kelly“A land bridge connected Minjerribah (Stradbroke Island) to Kombumerri country (Southport) and Goories also came in canoes to Minjerribah trading bunya for eugarie, amongst other things.” – History Life and Times of Robert Anderson, Gheebelum, Ngugi, MulgumpinReading this four years ago, I realised I knew nothing of the Indigenous history of my home on the Gold Coast – the land of the Saltwater people. I felt a responsibility to my young son to learn the story of the place we live, so that when he grew up I could teach it to him.But who was going to teach me? So I embarked on a voyage of discovery that carried me further than I ever expected, into a cultural story that is rarely offered to outsiders. What started as an attempt to educate myself became something far bigger – The Saltwater Story.Anderson’s account gave me an idea – why not make canoes and re-establish these ancient routes of connection? The Bundjalung, Yugambeh and Quandamooka were accomplished seafarers with complex maritime routes plied by bark and dugout canoe (gundal) – the former for short trips, the latter for longer voyages like the one described in Anderson’s book. The bark canoe in particular illustrates how to sustainably take what you need from your environment – the bark is removed but the tree remains alive and over time new bark grows. Very few still possess this knowledge – thanks to veteran paddler Mark Matthews I met Bundjalung canoemaker Kyle Slabb, who does. We quickly realised that this was more than just an opportunity for a whitefella to engage and educate himself – it was a chance to ensure cultural continuity in the next generation of Saltwater people. We decided to document the experience in a film, a book and an exhibit of David’s amazing photographs. As it happens, there was a suitable bark canoe tree in my backyard but the year was too dry to make a viable gundal. Nevertheless, Kyle’s demonstration of the crafting techniques to the younger generation was invaluable. We then made dugouts from hoop pine and paulownia the latter wood repels seawater, which prevents it from becoming waterlogged. Even when the temperature rose to 45 degrees, the young mob were interested in chipping in with (and away at) the canoe.We departed from the middle of Surfers Paradise on Australia Day weekend, surrounded by huge modern vessels and glittering towers. Maori, Dragonboaters and the general boating community joined us on the first leg in a wonderful flotilla – a celebration of all maritime histories in this country.Over the next three days and 70km through shark-infested waters we watched the young men grow into their roles, assume the mantle of leadership for the voyage. When we reached Dunwich (Goompi), a lot of the Quandamooka welcomed us. It was an emotional experience for many, especially as Robert Anderson himself, 88, was the elder who welcomed the paddlers … and with whom we exchanged bunya for eugarie. It had been 150 years since this journey had been made. There is talk now all along the Sea Eagle songline of canoe making, of connecting through the canoe over the saltwater again.So what will I tell my son?

We’re predicting that our ice-cream, gin and Taste of Summer barbecue staples will be real sizzlers – not to mention suncream flying off the shelves as we all head outdoors to soak up the rays.”DIY retailer B\u0026ampQ said that each of its flagship stores is likely to sell well over 100 barbecues, 3,000 bags of compost, 6,000 bedding plants, 150 mowers and 125 fence panels over the weekend.“At this time of year especially, customers do respond to the weather. We tend to see a change in the type of projects they do,” said Steve Guy, B\u0026ampQ’s market director for outdoor. We look at the weather forecast for the next 14 days and make trading and stock decisions on a daily basis.”“It’s no surprise that herbs are the must-have plant of the season they’re fragrant, look great and are the perfect addition to summer BBQs for both drinks and dining,” said Lilidh Matthews, herb buyer at Wyevale Garden Centres. “They also thrive in small spaces, and are an increasingly popular addition for city balconies and kitchen windowsills alike.” Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard, said garden and DIY-related goods were likely to fare well because it was the first opportunity for keen gardeners to get out planting and tidying-up after weeks of poor weather.“Anything related to the garden is likely to do well after such a poor Easter. People will use the opportunity to get out and do work in the garden and in the home. And of course fashion should benefit as people will want to replenish their wardrobe as the first signs of spring and summer emerge.”Well-stocked smaller convenience stores were expected to be among the bank holiday winners, according to analysts at research firm Kantar Worldpanel.“Whenever the mercury rises people swiftly move away from traditional meals and start focusing on the barbecue,” said Fraser McKevitt, Kantar’s head of retail and consumer insight. “In the interests of maximising their exposure to the sunshine consumers are also much more likely to shop locally rather than travel longer distances to bigger stores, so the retailers who’ve stocked up on sausages and burgers in their convenience outlets should perform well this weekend.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b11ab9017cb435a525978913a789e7d5","title":"colour guardian masthead opinion tabloid redesign","story":"A newspaper’s masthead is many things – flag, signature, capstone, brand and a thread through history. When the  of the Berliner format (12 September 2005 – 13 January 2018) was being refashioned into the  tabloid of today, intense attention was given to the masthead.Its award-winning typeface is bespoke, with the designers aiming to communicate “confidence and strength”. The editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, told me she wanted “a masthead with capital letters to signify a serious intent. I felt the lowercase T and G didn’t quite fit the mood of these serious times.”Initial reader reaction was mixed: “At long last … the return of the capital T in The and the capital G in ” “the typeface and the two-line arrangement feel less authoritative, too much thick-thin contrast” “the masthead is not yet sufficiently distinctive to stand out on the newsstand”. One devoted reader confessed that she had taken to rearranging the papers at her local Waitrose to ensure that the  was properly displayed. The fondness expressed for the old masthead will make one of my predecessors smile. After the Berliner’s debut, Ian Mayes reported readers’ “anxieties” about the masthead had manifested “in the form of an accusation that the background colour – blue – made it appear that the  was waving a banner for the Tory party.”At first I too missed the lowercase, sans-serif white type on blue background, until it dawned that this flag combination, this visual branding, has been comprehensively appropriated by one of the great disruptors of our era, Facebook.Taking the new masthead on its own terms, I have come to admire it, especially because of the way the front page has been evolving with it, in both design and\u0026nbspcolour.To my eye, the two decks of type and the position chosen for the The above the letters of  create an elegant slope to a sort of summit atop the h. It aspires, like all serious journalism should. The e curls to greet the ascender of the d below it. The prominent serifs connect the refreshed  with long-serving mastheads from its almost 200-year past.The significance of the connection was driven home at a recent exhibition in the Design Museum of London which told the story of the latest  redesign. Among the old front pages, trial-and-error samplings and typographical details was a caption which quietly challenged anyone who thinks of media as linear: “… for the first time the look of the newspaper is being determined by its digital counterpart. Infographics, large images and a high-contrast typeface – features which are usually seen online – are now being used in the printed newspaper. These design decisions indicate that digital media is revolutionising the way that we consume information both on and off the screen.” Viner and the leader of the designers, Alex Breuer, pointed out to me that the two decks are necessary to make the whole page versatile. Placed together on the same level, the two words  can dominate the tabloid-size page and restrict layout options.A fine example of the flexibility that the chosen masthead offers was the front page on 18 April. It launched the collaboration among several journalism organisations to continue the investigations by Maltese reporter Daphne Caruana Galizia, murdered last year. In white type on a mournful black background, the masthead was a band about two-thirds down page one. Above were a large portrait of Daphne, a headline in black on yellow, and the start of a special report which continued inside the paper. Under the band, at the foot of page one, was another disclosure in the Windrush scandal, and a pointer to more on page two about the Cambridge AnalyticaFacebook data harvesting. This combination of powerful design and powerful journalism is to be savoured.Use of colour has increased visibility on newsstands since the period in January when the masthead was black on a white background, like most of the competition. Now, black masthead type on a light-blue background, in either a narrow or a deep band, regularly appears Mondays to Thursdays. White type on cherry red denotes Fridays. On Saturdays, when the paper has a lot of supplements to shout about, a deep band of magenta, or pink, or deep blue might form the background and the type will be white. An exception was 14 April, when the type was black on a yellow background.I favour this search for a vocabulary of colour in print. It is a successful feature of the ’s digital presences. But tastes differ, of course, and the colours have provoked criticism too – “garish” and “the Gawdy’un” are examples from readers.The salmon-pinkish tint of the Journal pages – praised for their content and design – is a problem for readers with visual impairment. Ian Mayes received the same message in 2005 as I have lately: “Readers with degrees of colour-blindness or poor sight urged caution in the use of text laid on tints, to ensure that enough tonal contrast remained for the text to be clearly legible.”The demographic of the newspaper audience leans older, as it were, and\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspfeedback to this redesign indicates clearly that the issue is a matter of practical importance to many loyal  readers.

That is the fundamental lesson of the past six years – from the open, compassionate and pluralist spirit of the 2012 London Olympics, via the Tories’ surprise victory in 2015 and the nativist vote for Brexit in 2016, to Jeremy Corbyn’s unexpected surge in last year’s general election.The oscillation is bewildering, the runes unreadable. Which is why smarter Tories do not buy for a second the notion that we have reached “peak Corbyn” – a silly attempt to graft branding jargon on to nuanced psephological reality.Yes, Labour failed to take Barnet, Wandsworth and Westminster in last week’s local contests, and should be concerned about its failure to make much progress outside London. But the party denied the Tories control of Trafford, took Plymouth, and – according to the BBC – would be the largest party in the House of Commons if the results were replicated in a general election.What has been scotched (or should have been) is the no less silly myth of impregnable destiny that has gripped some parts of the Labour left since the Tories lost their majority. There is no direction to history, no teleology in a complex democracy. To say that Labour has a lot more to do to win – as Alastair Campbell and others did on Saturday – is not to reassert Blairite values, defend neoliberalism, or declare the Iraq war a roaring success. Least of all is it a “smear”. This is all about the hard grind of gaining power, the door-to-door trials that face any opposition if it is to become a government.William Hague has observed that the Tory party has two default positions: complacency and panic. It is fair to say that Conservatives are panicking a little less than they were a week ago. They have been reminded that Corbyn is a man rather than a shaman, that his path to No 10 is not mystically ordained. But, in private at least, they are uncertain what to do with this information, how to turn it into useful political action.Let us say that Theresa May does not fight the next general election as Tory leader, but aspires to remain in office until at least 29 March 2019, when Britain leaves the European Union. The most important question facing the party after her departure – more important than the identity of her successor – is the trajectory it chooses to follow when she is gone.You would need a heart of stone not to laugh at the decline of the movement formerly known as Nigel\u0026nbspFarage’s fan club. It is glorious that Ukip should now be self-identifying as the Black Death: the words of its general secretary. But the Tory party must at all costs avoid becoming the willing host to its contagion. The defining characteristic of the Ukip voter – past or present – is implacability. No Brexit will be hard enough, no immigration reform tough enough, no recoil from progress fierce enough to please them.It follows that a strategy designed to appease this tranche of the electorate is not only (in my view) terrible for the country but also (as a matter of fact) entirely pointless. If the post-May party becomes hostage to the spirit of Farage – and some say it already is – then it will lose the next general election, and deserve to do so.Ours is a deeply erse society, economically dependent upon immigration and culturally enriched by it. The Tory party has been wrestling with this fairly straightforward reality for more than 20 years now. What was once called “modernisation” is now in fairly obvious retreat: ask those affected by or – a much more numerous group – appalled at the Windrush scandal and the government’s handling of it.To win a majority again, the party has to persuade (for a start) young, urban, socially liberal and ethnic minority voters that it does not hate them. This is, to put it mildly, no easy task.Last week’s elections were a minor tremor alerting the political class to the tectonic uncertainty that still lies beneath. The Tories have been awakened from their fatalistic stupor and reminded they have a choice. What matters more, of course, is that the rest of us do too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0b57093fe2a030984998ff01a270f51bebd90c7/11_233_5456_3274/master/5456.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf2409405e351cb61abcd221cc08cc40","title":"bank holiday public","story":"A Manchester Day for Manchester, a Kent Day for Kent? How about an Equal Rights Day? Let’s make public holidays matterBritain has many quaint bank holiday rituals, such as sitting in motorway traffic jams or stubbornly lying on the beach when the wind-chill is close to freezing. One of the more understandable is pointing out how few days off we have compared with many other countries and calling to have more of them. I beg to differ. We shouldn’t have more bank holidays, we should abolish them altogether.Bank holidays are a British idiosyncrasy that some former members of our empire continue to honour. Other countries don’t have more of them, they have public holidays instead. This is not a matter of mere terminology. A public holiday is a shared civic commemoration of something important for the society that celebrates it. These include Bastille Day in France, Liberation Day in Italy and Waitangi Day in New Zealand, which commemorates the signing of the nation’s founding treaty by the British Crown and Māori chiefs.Even in America, where there is no legal right to any days off work, many employers observe Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Memorial Day, Independence Day and Martin Luther King Day. These all remind citizens of some of the important people and moments in their history, helping to forge a shared identity. In the UK, apart from Christmas and Easter, our bank holidays celebrate nothing at all. For example, last Tuesday most countries in the world celebrated International Workers’ Day. We just worked. Today’s early May bank holiday is supposed to be a surrogate but it has never been widely seen as a special day for working people.Chosen wisely, public holidays could do important civic work. For decades politicians have been wringing their hands about the failure to create a clear sense of Britishness and Englishness. They might have noticed that the only national day officially celebrated in the UK is St Andrew’s Day in Scotland. Why not give Northern Ireland, England and Wales their own national holidays as well as creating another for the whole of the United Kingdom? Allowing regions to have their own public holidays could help to foster local identities and boost civic pride. Some will be more enthusiastically embraced than others: I imagine Manchester Day would be a huge party. Kent Day would get people thinking more about what they love about the garden of England.The national conversation about which days to celebrate would itself provoke a valuable civic conversation. Many would champion International Women’s Day. A better option might be a day for equal rights which could honour all historically disadvantaged groups. As well as being a reminder of the work that still has to be done, it would hopefully over time become more of a celebration of what has been achieved.Adding non-Christian holidays to Christmas and Easter is tempting but impractical. The way to recognise all faiths and none is to give every citizen the right to take one or two days off a year for occasions of personal significance, no questions asked. A Jew could choose Passover, a Hindu Diwali, a Muslim Eid, a Sikh the birthday of Guru Nanak, and an atheist the anniversary of the release of Monty Python’s Life of Brian.Of course the creation of these holidays would run the risk of being politicised. But a non-partisan commission could be charged with making the decisions, ensuring our new national holidays are unifying, not isive.The right to paid leave should be part of the change from bank to public holidays. At the moment, workers have an annual entitlement of 5.6 weeks but no right to insist on taking it on bank holidays. Making time off mandatory for public holidays would reinforce their civic significance. If that means fewer shops open, depriving many of their preferred bank holiday entertainment, so be it. If they had something real to celebrate they might be less inclined to spend the day shopping anyway.The final change should be an end to the rule that makes all public holidays except Christmas and Good Friday fall on a Monday. This is part and parcel of the crudely utilitarian ethos of bank holidays, which are designed begrudgingly to ensure that if we must take time off it should interfere as little as possible with the usual routines of production and commerce.Other nations are more relaxed. In a lot of countries, when a holiday falls on a Tuesday or Thursday many take the day between it and the weekend off. In France, Italy, Portugal and Spain this is called “making the bridge”, in Sweden it’s a “squeeze day”, while in Chile they “take the sandwich”. If a day is truly important it should be celebrated whenever it falls. Taking time off seriously would challenge the Protestant work ethic assumption that we live to work, signalling that as a nation we believe that we work to live.• Julian Baggini is a British philosopher and the author of several books about philosophy, including A Short History of Truth (Quercus).

At 13 months, he has managed “mama”, “dada”, a bit of “gaga” and, once, “bus”. Mostly it’s just happy jabber, escalating to “EeeeeeeEEE!” at the sight of something extraordinary, like traffic lights or a lid.What might have slightly frightened me would be if his first word had been his own name. Scarier still: if it was his only word, repeated over and over, usually spoken, sometimes sung, always with the understanding that this alone was sufficient explanation, justification and conversation. Me! Full\u0026nbspstop. Me! Full stop. On repeat. For ever.Sound unlikely? Yes, except that such grandiosity is encouraged by the two main TV shows aimed at his age group. Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa or Po get their mouths round “Eh-oh”, “big hug”, and, from time to time, “custard”, but they are most comfortable reminding us which Teletubby they are. Their arrival every episode is heralded by all the fanfare and hierarchy of a Regency ball. Their leave-taking takes aeons.The heroes of In the Night Garden, meanwhile, take nominative determination to another level. Iggle Piggle, Upsy Daisy and Makka Pakka say nothing but their own names, apart from a handful of rhymes in the special songs that introduce each of them every episode.This self-absorption is reflected in their adventures. Upsy Daisy (“Upsy Daisy here I come  I’m the only upsy one  I’m the only daisy too  Ipsy, upsy, daisy doo”) is a vainglorious a, always prancing uninvited front of the cameras and blowing kisses at the screen. Iggle Piggle (“Yes, my name is Iggle Piggle  Iggle Piggle, niggle, wiggle, diggle  Yes, my name is Iggle Piggle  Iggle Piggle, wiggle, niggle, woo”) is a sweetie, but all id. The only character to exhibit anything approaching altruism is Makka Pakka (“Makka Pakka, akka wakka, mikka makka moo  Makka Pakka, appa yakka, ikka akka, ooo  Hum dum, agga pang, ing, ang, ooo  Makka Pakka, akka wakka, mikka makka moo”), a big lad who squeaks about on some sort of Zimmer trying to sponge people down. Kindness? Compulsion? It’s unclear.Hammering home names is doubtless terrific for brand awareness. That I can reel off all eight of the Tiddlytubbies (baby versions, new this series, parentage murky) is testimony to the writers’ faith in repetition.But I also wonder whether it’s unhelpful to school a generation quite so early that identity is paramount. Yes, everyone’s experience deserves to be heard widely, everyone’s insights – regardless of banality – matter Twitter is popular for a reason. But the idea that mere reiteration of your existence will do the trick risks breeding conceit and, ultimately, disappointment.When I was a tot, the preschool market was less energetically tapped by TV producers, but the perspective did feel more world-facing. Charlie, the cartoon sidekick from Words and Pictures, was far from a shrinking violet, but miles too excited by pencils to navel-gaze. Zippy, George and Bungle were largely deskbound in Rainbow, yet I can’t imagine the scorn had one of them hijacked proceedings to chant their own name.Parenthood is a time when the mere presence of someone else can indeed seem miraculous. I can’t be the only one who, for a split second, occasionally forgets they’ve got a baby, then gets floored by floods of love on remembering. But the people behind these TV shows seem to have transferred an adult’s amazed adoration of their offspring to the children themselves. And though babies are entertained by their own face in a mirror, they tend not to get misty-eyed at the sight.In combination with an app, this small box enables you to set limits on usage .

My son has a small collection of pocket-sized plastic toys, available in all good supermarkets, which emit various phrases at the touch of a button.

Happily, none of these are especially gendered. But they are all raving narcissists.Spend a few seconds with a hungry infant and you can\u0026nbspbe in no doubt of their self-interest. But their lack of filter means you can also be sure that, beyond basic needs, they have no particular desire to self-aggrandise.

What if a company told its mineworkers that attendance at presidential rally during the 2012 election cycle was “mandatory”, but “no one was forced to attend”? Do you think they would feel like they might be penalized for non-attendance?These examples are real, and they come from Alexander Hertel-Fernandez’s new book, Politics at Work: How Companies Turn their Workers into Lobbyists. The book documents an extraordinary practice, and admittedly, one to which I had paid far too little attention: companies frequently try to persuade and mobilize their employees to support politicians and policies beneficial to the corporation. Because of the inherent power imbalance between managers and workers, these practices look more like coercion than simple free speech. Hertel-Fernandez is a political scientist at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, and Politics at Work brings together a variety of studies – of managers, workers, legislative staff – exploring different aspects of employee mobilization. He reports that one-third of workers in one of his studies worried about retaliation if they didn’t follow corporate wishes. And unsurprisingly given their precarious financial situation, lower-income workers were more susceptible. When corporations monitor whether employees engage in political activities (and Hertel-Fernandez says that some do), employees are also more likely to respond to managers’ wishes.Another interesting finding is that corporate managers think these practices are extremely useful. Managers ranked employee mobilization efforts as more effective for influencing policy than any other activity except lobbying – more than donating to candidates and more than buying political advertising. This is important because many activists and scholars who focus on political corruption and reform emphasize campaign finance issues. While such issues are hugely important, they are only the tip of a deep iceberg that includes lobbying, the revolving door from industry to government, and funding for grassroots groups. Employee mobilization plunges still further into the frigid waters where money turns to power. Interestingly, according to Hertel-Fernandez’s analysis, the Citizens United case was particularly important in expanding employee mobilization activities: after the case, it became clear to corporations that such activities were protected.Hertel-Fernandez is careful to note that employee mobilization has taken place through history, that it can happen on both the right and the left, and that workplace politics might have some virtues. But it is worth lingering on the reasons why the practice can be destructive. Economically, worker and corporate interests are not always aligned. Corporations arguing against healthcare or the minimum wage might be acting more from ideology than any real threat to their bottom line. It also isn’t clear that mobilizing employees to support the corporation’s profit-seeking agenda will be good for the economy overall. We have a consumer-driven economy, which grows when consumers have money to spend. This, in turn, means that policies that build and preserve a strong, large middle class will be superior to those that deepen the pockets of the wealthy. Politically, employee mobilization shrinks the space for active citizenship, blurring the line between work and politics, especially for financially insecure workers who might be more susceptible to implicit threats. And with labor unions in decline and corporate employees mobilized, the asymmetry of political power and influence will only deepen if employee mobilization expands.Of course, with Citizens United still on the books, the question is what to do about it. Hertel-Fernandez focuses on solutions to the worst excesses of employee mobilization, including extending the bar on coercing employees into corporate Pac activities to all corporate political activities, banning companies from penalizing workers who refuse to attend political meetings, and protecting workers from employment retaliation for their political beliefs and actions. All of these solutions would help, but the real challenge is that we are trapped in a vicious cycle. The greater the power differential between ordinary citizens and corporations, the harder it is to make change. And the more that corporations lobby, donate to campaigns and engage in employee mobilization, the wider the power differential gets.

The environmental fashion campaigner, who grew up in Italy, remembers hand washing her sweaters each summer, carefully storing them away, then unpacking them the following winter. She would wear them year after year so she had to look after them. This was before fast, disposable fashion she says, “We did it a different way.”These days, as the founder of Eco-Age, a brand consultancy firm that works with luxury fashion labels on improving their sustainability credentials, and as someone who makes frequent appearances on the red carpet alongside her Oscar-winning husband actor Colin Firth, she has an expanded wardrobe – yet it’s probably not as big as you may imagine. In 2010 Firth came up with the Green Carpet Challenge, using her visibility in front of the world’s media to wear only ethical, sustainable and repurposed fashion, and she’s often photographed repeatedly wearing the same gowns as part of her #30wears pledge.She was a long way from Hollywood’s red carpets last year when she travelled to Tasmania to meet some of Australia’s top merino wool growers and learn about the production of wool. Each year she travels to a different country to learn more about the global supply chain. “You can never replace the real experience of meeting people and seeing things with your own eyes.” Recently she’s visited Bangladesh to meet the garment factory workers and Brazil to meet the leather farmers threatening the Amazon leather.The trip to Tasmania was “facilitated” by Woolmark, the Australian company that promotes the use of merino wool around the world, and her experiences were captured in a short documentary Fashionscapes: Forever Tasmania She says she didn’t know what to expect. “You have images of huge herds of sheep overgrazing and intensively reared and then we ended up in this landscape.” Tasmanian farmers like Matt and Vanessa Dunbabin of Bangor farm, who farm merino sheep, prime beef and prime lamb, and Roderic O’Connor, who runs the wool farm Connorville met with her, and she says she found their careful approach to land conservation and sustainable wool production inspiringThe controversial practice of mulesing is a significant issue for the industry, with international wool buyers pushing farmers to phase it out, not least because of customer concerns. Firth asked the farmers about it, and on camera O’Connor says the industry is looking for solutions, through breeding and by using pain relief. For Firth it remains an ethical dilemma. “It’s not a nice practice but if it is done properly it saves the sheep’s life and a death from hell.”The industry is also seen as having a significant environmental impact thanks to pesticide use, greenhouse gas emissions and, in some cases, overgrazing. The washing, dyeing and treatment of wool can also have an impact. Yet the wool industry is pushing back, saying the life cycle assessment tools often used by the fashion industry don’t measure the full supply chain. Woolmark points out that wool is natural, renewable and biodegradable. Firth was convinced, saying that wool comes out on top when compared to the evils of synthetic fibres, which shed microplastics each time they are washed and are not biodegradable. “If you throw away a wool sweater, it composes in the ground very quickly, and it doesn’t waste microfibres when you wash it.”The day before our interview was the fifth anniversary of the Rana Plaza tragedy, when the collapse of the garment factories killed 1134 workers. Firth recently visited Bangladesh and she was disheartened to see how little has changed for the fast fashion industry. “There are new Bangladeshs every day,” she says. “Today all the big guys have just moved to Ethiopia to produce in a country where there is not even minimum wage so the story repeats itself in terms of the businesses and how they produce.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30fa24ebea2b21ee16fe403caa084534da14a0bd/0_521_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=471021b6e6aac7a897c52b8e714b95f0","title":"good day sunshine what to wear in may in pictures","story":"As the old adage goes, ‘Ne’er cast a clout till May be out’ – here’s how you can transition your look from spring to summer without being caught out by a cold snap"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75d1ebc99fa0eebca93e813c70e372bbed6766ed/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1151eff6e6dc8953792193dfa402650","title":"lean on pete review andrew haigh modern american odyssey charlie plummer","story":"British director Andrew Haigh’s modern American odyssey sees Charlie Plummer excel as a teen fleeing grim realitiesA performance of remarkable depth, candour and vulnerability by rising star Charlie Plummer lies at the heart of this terrifically moving fourth feature film from British writer-director Andrew Haigh. Adapted from the 2010 novel by Willy Vlautin, Lean on Pete blends timeless American myths with pin-point portrayals of modern urban hardship, as its lonely teenage lead heads east from Oregon with a horse on its last hurrah. The travails are tough but there’s an unsentimental tenderness at the centre of Haigh’s movie – a melancholic counterpoint to the grim realities of life from which our young hero flees.Plummer plays Charley Thompson, a lanky 15-year-old (he lies about his age) who has moved home umpteen times with his single father, Ray (Travis Fimmel). With dreams of playing for the high-school football team blighted by a nomadic lifestyle, Charley has become a loner who has learned to fend for himself. Running past the Portland Meadows racetrack, he meets Steve Buscemi’s trainer, Del Montgomery, who offers him a few bucks to change a tyre and help with his horses. “Never let go of the rope,” Del tells Charley an instruction that seems to double as a diehard life lesson.A diffident yet attentive presence, Charley has a trusting nature and finds a kindred spirit in the eponymous quarter horse, a former short-sprint winner (“Don’t blink or you’ll miss it”). The endearingly named Lean on Pete is showing signs of age, and Del is getting ready to send him, euphemistically, “to Mexico”. “You can’t get attached to a horse,” says Bonnie (Chloë Sevigny), a jockey who has suffered her fair share of injuries, and who observes tellingly that “there’s only so many times you can fall down, right?” But when all hope seems lost, Charlie hits the trail with his one true friend, heading for Wyoming and searching for somewhere to call home.Vlautin’s novel has been described by critics as a distant descendant of Walter Farley’s The Black Stallion, with shades of Salinger and Steinbeck. There is a quote from the latter at the start of the novel that Haigh has clearly taken to heart. “It is true that we are weak and sick and ugly and quarrelsome,” Steinbeck wrote, “but if that is all we ever were, we would millenniums ago have disappeared from the face of the Earth.” Haigh paints sympathetic portraits of all the characters the good, the bad and the ugly. Ray may not be an ideal father, but there’s a tangible tenderness in the scenes with his son, and a sense of closeness that persists even during his frequent absences. Del is a world-weary chancer who dopes, exploits and then dumps his horses, yet there’s a gruff paternal affection in his advice to Charley to “do something else before there’s nothing else you can do”. Even Steve Zahn’s drunken drifter Silver has a child-like quality that is counterposed with a violent tinderbox temper.After the tight focus of Weekend and 45 Years (which the director described as “companion piece” pictures), Haigh widens his canvas as Charley heads into the desert, embarking upon an American odyssey to which Danish cinematographer Magnus Nordenhof Jønck responds with lyrical grandeur. While the narrative may be read as a coming-of-age story, there’s something more elemental in Charley’s search for a beloved aunt, who comes to represent his idealised yearning for a lost family life. Crucially, Charley remains at the centre of the picture, with the oblong 1.85 frame lending a human dimension to these expansive vistas, ensuring that we don’t get distracted by the scenery, or lose sight of the true focus of the story.Unsurprisingly, Lean on Pete is a film in which gestures are more important than words. Having declared in passing that “You won’t see me again in California”, Del shoots Charley a glance that speaks volumes about his shady past. As for Charley, he may have been schooled in Sam Shepard-style manly “truths” (“The best women have all been waitresses at some point,” Ray tells him between beers), but his voice has a lilting softness, which matches the expressiveness of his face. At times, there’s a touch of James Dean in Plummer’s plaintive delivery, along with echoes of Jon Voight’s marooned hustler in Midnight Cowboy. Having made a splash in Felix Thompson’s 2015 indie-pic King Jack, Plummer has proved a mercurial presence in films as erse as Oren Moverman’s The Dinner andmore recently Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World. In Lean on Pete, this rising star proves his mettle in a role for which he is simply perfect."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6fde70dfdc9a66369bd368e17810b584d24dbd8/0_247_2432_1459/master/2432.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c299bd4b0220364209a65a9362c01eb5","title":"liverpool jurgen klopp critical of mohamed saleh dive agaainst chelsea","story":"Jürgen Klopp has made clear his disapproval of the e from Mohamed Salah which led to the footballer of the year being booked as Liverpool succumbed to Chelsea, a result which has offered last season’s Premier League champions hope of infiltrating the top four.Salah was cautioned after going to ground at Gary Cahill’s first‑half challenge with the Egyptian, up against his former club, well marshalled by Antonio Rüdiger and enduring a third scoreless game in succession. “Yes I think it was a e, was it?” Klopp said. “Or he waited for the contact, I am not sure, so that is not what I want to see, that is not what he wants to do. But obviously it happened.“With all the other situations, he couldn’t get any foul any more. That is not right as well. It was always like this and you have to deal with that.”The forward, who has scored 41 goals this season, was up against a former team-mate at Roma in Rüdiger, with Klopp confident he will rediscover his scoring touch in time for the European Cup final against Real Madrid on 26\u0026nbspMay.“He has to be much better, he can do much better and he will score again, there is no doubt about that. There was no space for anything out there. He can play with no space actually, but not today. That is it, all good.”Chelsea’s victory hoisted Antonio Conte’s side to within three points of their third-placed opponents before the midweek visit of Huddersfield. If that game is won – and even if the fourth‑placed Tottenham prosper in their own fixture against Newcastle on Wednesday – the race for the top four will go to the final afternoon when Liverpool host Brighton and the London club travel to Tyneside. “And Newcastle is not a holiday trip, or at least it doesn’t sound like a holiday trip to me,” said Klopp, who declined to comment on suggestions in France that Liverpool are in talks with Lyon over their attacking midfielder Nabil Fekir.Conte said: “We must be pleased with our will to fight and desire to keep hope alive to take a place in the Champions League. I don’t know if this will be enough at the end of the season to get a place in the Champions League, but we have to try.“It’s important to approach this situation with great pride and a great will to fight, to show we are still alive.

I feel as if people my age judge me as immature because I’m a virgin and, lately, it has compromised my social skills in general.

You do not have to disclose such private information, and it is well to bear in mind that many people lie about it anyway. It would be smart to avoid submitting to this pressure.Rehearse some answers you might give if the subject arises, and enjoy being mysterious and noncommittal. Most importantly, make friends with your body. This is a vital, long-term prerequisite for personal happiness, so start finding ways to make peace with it. If you assume that prospective lovers will always judge you, it will be harder for you to connect erotically with them. But if you are comfortable with your body and know what feels exciting and sensually appealing to you, others will be attracted to you.Take your time. There is no rush to explore your sexuality.

Ideally, you need a mix of “feet on the ground” activity and muscle resistance such as weights, press-ups and swimming. No one knows precisely how much exercise is needed the NHS says adults aged 19 to 64 should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity every week. Three 10-minute periods of fast walking every day is a good target. There is little evidence that exercise prevents fractures once you have weak bones (called osteopenia if it is mild and osteoporosis if more severe), but people who keep active into old age are less likely to fall – and if you don’t fall, you are less likely to break a bone.Smoking has an impact on bone-building cells, especially in people younger than 30, who are still accumulating bone. Smokers are at increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures and stopping smoking is likely to improve bone strength. It is a complicated association: smokers may also be thinner than the healthy weight range if you fall but have no padding, you are more likely to fracture a bone. After the menopause, women make some oestrogen – which keeps bones strong – in their fat layer. Once your ovaries stop producing oestrogen, you can’t make much of it if you don’t have any fat.No one is saying that it helps to be overweight you need to be able to keep moving, of course, and the heavier you are, the more force will land on your bones if you fall. But small-framed, low-weight people have less total bone mass. As a result, losing even small amounts of weight may result in bones that break easily.Women are four times more likely than men to get osteoporosis, since their levels of oestrogen fall after the menopause. Hormone replacement therapy can help maintain strong bones and prevent fragility fractures (fractures that occur on minimal force). Once you have osteoporosis, though, it is not very effective.The main risk of having thin bones is fragility fractures. Elderly people who fall and break a hip may never regain their independence. Vertebral fractures may be silent initially, but tend to recur and can become multiple and extremely painful and disabling. One of the most useful things you can do for a frail relative or friend is check their home for potential hazards such as loose carpet. Occupational therapy assessment, to fit hand rails to steps and baths, can be accessed via local authority websites or a GP referral.You are at increased risk of osteoporosis if you are elderly, female, underweight or immobile if you have had previous fractures and if you smoke, drink a lot of alcohol (more than 30 units a week) or take steroids for a condition such as rheumatoid arthritis. You can do your own risk assessment (there is a useful risk calculator on the University of Sheffield’s website). In some cases, a bone density scan is useful. This can be arranged by your GP, but the scan needs to be taken in context of your overall risk. If you are at high risk, you will probably be advised to have treatment to build up your bones, even if the scan is normal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4ccd10ef37846c563e2db82a2e5ce5d85225b1c/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dee7fe1cbdf71f39bf0b545af0b4ed0f","title":"rspb lost focus binoculars","story":"They accept responsibility for the repair, but won’t respond to my emails about collectionThree years ago, my wife purchased a set of binoculars from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds that lately developed a fault with the left eyepiece.

Figures for the value of the global meat industry vary wildly from $90bn to as much as $741bn. What about its cultural and social importance?Cooked meat may have been partially responsible for the large brains that characterise Homo sapiens and have put humans where we are now. Cooking made calories from meat (and from vegetables) easier to consume and absorb than in a raw form. And the domestication of certain animals – along with the domestication of wild grains and vegetables – marked the beginning of human agricultural history in the “fertile crescent”. Throughout human history the hunting and farming of meat has been part of our stories and mythologies and some of our legal and religious systems the fatted calf for the prodigal son the medieval forest laws that created areas where no one but English royalty could hunt the sacrifical sheep to mark the beginning of Eid Al-Adha even the roasted wild boars consumed at the end of every adventure by Asterix and Obelix. But is meat still crucial to human life? Some argue that, just because we’ve always eaten meat, that doesn’t mean we always have to. If we can get all the dietary nutrients and protein that we need elsewhere, should we? The old-fashioned vision of a mixed farm with wheat and chickens and pigs still exists. More than half of the farms in the US, for example, were small enough in 2012 to have sales of less than $10,000 dollars. But the 20th century saw the application of the principles of the industrial revolution to agriculture - how could inputs be minimised and profits be maximised?  The result was the factory farm, first for chickens, then pigs, and more recently cattle. Producers discovered that animals could be kept inside, and fed grain, and could be bred to grow more quickly and get fatter in the right places. Since 1925, the average days to market for a US chicken has been reduced from 112 to 48, while its weight has ballooned from a market weight of 2.5 pounds to 6.2. Pig and cattle farming has followed suit. Sows are held in gestation crates for up to four weeks once they are pregnant, and then put into farrowing crates once they’ve had their piglets to prevent them accidentally crushing their young. Industrially reared pigs spend their lives in indoor pens. Cattle farming is now being similarly streamlined, with cows in the last few months of their lives being fattened in feedlots with no access to grass and sometimes no shelter.What is the environmental impact of our current farming model? It is extremely difficult to separate out the different impacts of different farming models and types. Many measurements look at agricultural impact without making a distinction between arable v livestock, or industrial v small farms. However, the following information begins to indicate the scale of the problem. An influential study in 2010 of the water footprints for meat estimated that while vegetables had a footprint of about 322 litres per kg, and fruits drank up 962, meat was far more thirsty: chicken came in at 4,325lkg, pork at 5,988lkg, sheepgoat meat at 8,763lkg, and beef at a stupendous 15,415lkg. Some non-meat products were also pretty eye-watering: nuts came in at 9,063lkg.  Farms contribute to water pollution in a range of ways: some of those are associated more closely with arable farming, and some with livestock, but it’s worth remembering that one-third of the world’s grain is now fed to animals. The FAO believes that the livestock sector, which is growing and intensifying faster than crop production, has “serious implications” for water quality.  The types of water pollution include: nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilisers and animal excreta) pesticides sediment organic matter (oxygen demanding substances such as plant matter and livestock excreta) pathogens (E coli etc) metals (selenium etc) and emerging pollutants (drug residues, hormones and feed additives).  The impacts are wide-reaching. Eutrophication is caused by excesses of nutrients and organic matter (animal faeces, leftover feed and crop residues) – which cause algae and plants to grow excessively and use up all the oxygen in the body of wate at the expense of other species. A review in 2015 identified 415 coastal bodies already suffering these problems. Pesticide pollution can kill weeds and insects away from the agricultural area, with impacts that may be felt all the way up the food chain. And although scientists do not yet have full data on the connection between antibiotic use in animals and rising levels of antibiotic resistance in the human population, water pollution by antibiotics (which continue to have an active life even after going through the animal and into the water) is definitely in the frame. It’s hard to work out exactly what quantity of greenhouse gases (GHG) is emitted by the meat industry from farm to fork carbon emissions are not officially counted along entire chains in that way, and so a number of complicated studies and calculations have attempted to fill the gap.What about the giant companies that dominate the sector? A 2017 landmark studyfound that the top three meat firms – JBS, Cargill and Tyson – emitted more greenhouse gases in 2016 than all of France.  Some argue that veganism is the only sane way forward. A study last year showed, for example, that if all Americans substituted beans for beef, the country would be close to meeting the greenhouse gas goals agreed by Barack Obama. The UN Food and Agricultural Organisation has a huge collection of data, and has also published some crucial reports on this issue, including the groundbreaking Livestock’s long shadow.Some institutions doing interesting research include Sustain The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy Brighter Green Sustainable Food Trust IPES-food.

Likewise if you are on any of the other edge squares of the grid, and the arrow in the square points out, you get out.But if you are not on an edge, you will probably start roaming around the grid. Here’s a statement:“No matter which directions the arrows are pointing at the start, and no matter which square you choose to begin, you will always eventually get OUT OF THE GRID”True or false? Prove it one way or the other.I’ll be back at 5pm UK time with the answer.

It is reasonable to meet the needs of known autistic iniduals attending an event but not to assume all “autistic” needs are common.A withdrawal space may be useful for all (although perhaps then not so quiet). Some autistic iniduals find it difficult to cope with fluorescent lighting andor high glare or contrast, but others are disturbed and disoriented by low levels of lighting, especially if this results in more shadows. Many autistic iniduals have learned to cope with clapping if they know when it will happen and it does not go on for too long. Some are excited by “flapping” and feel compelled to join in when exposed to it, often becoming disoriented and upset.The danger is that these changes give the impression of dealing with the problem of access, whereas the effect is greater segregation. Will not special autism sessions increase intolerance at other times?Most of the things autistic iniduals find intolerable (“lift” music everywhere, crowded aisles in supermarkets with unwanted intrusive advertisements, sudden, badly articulated announcements, etc) are also disliked by the rest of us.

The daughter of an Irish mother and Ghanian father, she spent the first couple of years of her life with her extended family in Ghana before growing up in south-east London and holidaying in Ireland to visit her maternal grandmother. Food – heaps of food from cooks who wouldn’t tolerate anyone leaving the dinner table hungry – features strongly in childhood memories of long summer days in Bantry Bay, County Cork. “Some of my earliest memories are very specifically about the smell of food cooking in Ireland – cabbage, black pudding frying. My aunt had a butcher’s shop so I was used to seeing a pig’s head on the counter and cows’ tongues hanging on hooks. We ate lots of offal, but we also used to go to the beach to hunt for crabs, to the river for salmon, and to the mountain to dig out peat for the fire – that smell always unlocks memories of my mum and her family. Peat, the smell of the sea, the morning dew – that landscape had its own special smell, a smell of freshness.”Food from a very different landscape was how, as a keen home cook, Adjonyoh later discovered and explored her Ghanian identity. The mysterious ingredients her father brought home to cook with were the same ones she would use to create dishes for her pop-up supper club in Brixton and her debut cookbook, Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen, published to great acclaim last year. These staples of Ghanian cookery were, she says, her sensory “access points” to finding out about her African heritage.“My father would be cooking with things I’d never heard of I didn’t know what they were,” she recalls. “Before I could taste them, I’d be aware of their unfamiliar smell and that’s a really strong memory of him in the kitchen – I’d want to eat something just from the aroma while it cooked.” After travelling to Ghana as an adult, and experimenting with traditional dishes back at home in her Hackney Wick kitchen, she started cooking updated versions of the recipes for friends. She sourced produce from Dalston’s Ridley Road market, getting to know the Ghanian women who sold from kiosks. “Shopping there, for me, was like being transported to another world,” she recalls. “They would help me identify ingredients and tell me how to cook them. The smells, flavours and colours were just amazing.”Some of the smells when she visited Ghana were a little too amazing. At a market with her aunt, Adjonyoh asked what a particularly pungent smell was. “What smell?” said her aunt, and carried on shopping. It turned out to be some cowhide drying in the sun, ready for eating later. Laughing, she recalls her aunt’s brief explanation: “‘Oh that’s wele,’ and I said: ‘What the hell is wele?’” The flavour wasn’t as strong as the smell, once she plucked up the courage to try it. “I was a bit wary of it, to be honest.”While her father’s cooking was hearty and traditional, it was a case of “there you are, get stuck in, don’t bother with cutlery”, she explains.Adjonyoh adapted recipes to make them visually appealing (gloopy okra was transformed into okra fries) because of the adage about people eating with their eyes. But it was the smell of her peanut butter stew – based on her father’s legendary groundnut soup – that drew people to come and buy food from an impromptu stall at her flat. “The dish has an amazing smell profile from the blend of spices,” she says. “People were asking what the smell was, how the dish was made. It was very much the smell that brought people to my door.”A career in food wasn’t the plan, but the clamour for her African cooking paid her way through an MA in creative writing: “It was just the demand. I loved the cooking and so did all the people who tried it.” The supper club, with just six tables and housed in a shipping container, was born, and for three years celebrated the variety, richness and abundance of Ghanian food. Now it’s time for a new adventure, with Adjonyoh travelling across Kenya and Uganda for a month to meet female chefs, cooks and food bloggers: “I want to understand each country’s relationship with food, the history of that, their distinctive produce and why it is that their food industry is largely dominated by women.” The journey will once again unite her passions for cooking, writing and travel. “I can’t wait to soak up the sights and sounds of two new food cultures,” she says. “When you’re travelling, all your senses are heightened. The first thing that always draws me in is food smells. No doubt I’ll be led by my nose again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc89218ce3843f49f7e386483e5919f78b739dcc/0_49_2990_1795/master/2990.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8026b29a04c019d7647262331cb03984","title":"glasgow queen street london kings cross railway station survey","story":"London King’s Cross has highest satisfaction rating in Transport Focus study of 56 stationsGlasgow Queen Street is Britain’s most unpopular railway station, new figures show.The independent transport watchdog surveyed more than 28,000 passengers and the list comprises 56 stations where at least 100 people responded. The survey was conducted between September and November last year, shortly after a £100m modernisation project began at Glasgow Queen Street. Nine months into the work, some passengers are still unhappy with the station’s condition.Cameron MacIntosh from Stirling said: “The station is an absolute bomb site at the moment. It really looks like a place from the third world. I try and avoid it.”John McInnes from Cumbernauld said: “I hope they are going to finish it because it looks a disaster just now. It’s embarrassing bringing friends or relations here. They can’t believe the mess of the place.”Margaret McGinley from Larbert said: “It will look bad for a while, but I think it’ll be amazing when they’ve completed the renovation work.”The Abellio ScotRail-operated station was used by 15 million passengers in 2016-17, making it Scotland’s third-busiest station.One Gatwick airport passenger who responded to the survey said the West Sussex station was small and cramped with long queues for tickets and overcrowding on platforms. Another described it as an “appalling welcome to the UK”.Other critical respondents include one who claimed London Victoria was “grubby for what should be a flagship station”, and another who said the platforms at Cardiff Central were very run down.Anthony Smith, the Transport Focus chief executive, said: “While Glasgow Queen Street is being redeveloped it’s vital that the ScotRail Alliance continues to talk to passengers about the improvements and makes sure staff are on hand to help. Investment in stations can improve passengers’ satisfaction when targeted at features which make a difference to their experience.“Passengers’ top priorities for stations include arrival time information, waiting rooms and the overall look and feel of the station.”A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the rail industry, said: “As part of the partnership railway’s long-term plan, and to deliver on our commitment to boost local communities, we’re investing to improve 178 small and medium-sized stations right across the country.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b77d0a429a164e7085ceb936ddf800e37f748e59/0_300_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb271976ebfa9602c59d30e032a68384","title":"low turnout lebanon election voter scepticism","story":"First parliamentary poll in nine years viewed as unlikely to shake up country’s political orderLow turnout marred Lebanon’s first parliamentary poll in nine years, with voters seemingly unconvinced that a new ballot – and system of voting – could shake up a political order that has remained beholden to regional interests since the end of the civil war.Many who did not vote said they believed the election had been predetermined by the very exiles promising change and that a new, complex electoral law intended to inject fresh voices had instead cemented the old guard.“If I thought standing in a two-hour line to vote would change anything, I would have,” said Mohammed Obeida, a Beirut resident. “I would have taken my grandad too. He stayed home because he’s seen it all before.”Early indications suggested that two major political blocs, the pro-western March 14 alliance, and the pro-Iran and Syria March 8, may have been diminished, a result that – if borne out – could unsettle an already fragile domestic scene that has been dominated by former warlords from the civil war era.Both factions started as protest movements in the aftermath of the assassination of the former prime minister Rafik Hariri, and have been central to Lebanese society since. However, the new electoral law, which replaced a winner-takes-all system with proportional representation requiring a choice for a list as well as an inidual candidate, is thought likely to weaken the two blocs.March 14, which is dominated by Sunni Muslims and half the country’s Christians, appeared most at risk of fragmenting, with waning Saudi backing and growing disaffection leading some Sunnis to look for new power bases. Saad Hariri’s hold on the prime ministership is not likely to be threatened. However, ahead of the election he faced a mounting challenge from Sunni figures whose support he could have banked on earlier in his tenure.Hezbollah, a dominant player in Lebanon’s political landscape, had also faced dissent within its usually disciplined ranks, particularly over its ongoing involvement in Syria where up to 1,800 members have been killed supporting Bashar al-Assad. However, the militia cum political bloc appeared to have performed well in its strongholds and could emerge from the ballot with an even tighter hold on Lebanon’s affairs.Such a result would unsettle neighbouring Israel and Saudi Arabia, which scaled back its long-term support for Hariri when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman summonsed him to Riyadh last November and ordered him to resign, after complaining that his government had given cover to Hezbollah – the most important arm of Iran’s foreign policy. Hariri was eventually able to leave Riyadh, but his relationship with the Saudi leadership has remained strained, and the Saudis remained largely disengaged from the election process.“If the Saudis stayed in this, things may have been better for the Sunnis,” said Othman Skaf, from north Lebanon. “They left because the country was being eaten by Hezbollah. But by leaving they ensured that would happen even quicker.”Nadim Shehadi, the director of the Fares Centre for Eastern Mediterranean Studies at Tufts University in Boston, said: “The big picture is that the Sunnis being defeated regionally translated into fragmentation and crisis of leadership on the ground. This is not good because the frustration could produce more support to radicals. The alternative leadership would be more radical.”While the election was contested largely on local issues, such as rampant corruption, a moribund economy and poor civic services, regional affairs loomed large. A raging war in Syria, the ongoing fallout from the US-led invasion of Iraq, wars against Islamic State and in Syria and the displacement of more than half of Syria’s population have fed disaffection across Lebanon.Sunni populations have felt especially disgruntled, with senior leaders and residents claiming they are on the losing side of a regional ledger that has seen Shia Iran prosper in three countries at their expense."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9e801d7fd8a832272ef4ab0d9f8088383448346/0_0_2493_1496/master/2493.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=462b2bd81538d3f28c005768bec2a0a2","title":"thai activists claim victory over luxury housing on forest land","story":"Government bows to protesters and agrees to shelve development near Chiang MaiEnvironmental activists in the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai claimed victory on Sunday after the country’s military government agreed not to continue the development of luxury property on forest land. The decision follows a demonstration in Chiang Mai last week in which more than 1,000 people protested against the construction of a luxury development earmarked to house judges in the foothills of the Doi Suthep mountains. The demonstration was one of the largest since Thailand’s junta took power in a 2014 coup. It was also one of a growing number of anti-government protests, including in Bangkok, that are putting pressure on the government before a general election planned for early 2019. Green ribbons symbolising the environmental movement have appeared in public places in Chiang Mai, including on lamp posts and on cars, over the past week. The Thai prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha sent Suwaphan Tanyuvardhana, one of his senior officials, to Chiang Mai on Sunday to talk to protest leaders. “We have concluded that no one will be living in this housing estate,” Suwaphan said after a meeting with the activists. The area will eventually be restored to the forest, he added. The government would form a committee with activists and representatives from the local community to determine the future use of the land currently under development, which includes 45 houses, he said.A decision will be taken later this week, but construction of the homes already under way would have to continue for the government to honour its agreement with the construction firm involved. Activists hailed the decision as a victory. “What we have now is a promise that Doi Suthep forest will be restored,” said Teerasak Roopsuwan, one of the movement’s leaders. “I think this could be a model for other parts of the country that public projects must not only be legal, but they must also consider local people’s opinions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/500d10b4a8f9fa890160e8f9300b9726416bcaee/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea3cb6c5149d4c7628a46aeee1bf2d56","title":"who is amlo mexico andres manuel lopez obrador election","story":"A promise by Andrés Manuel López Obrador to tackle rampant corruption has helped propel him to frontrunner status but detractors paint him as an Hugo Chávez-style ‘tropical messiah’It has been more than three decades since Teresa Jaber sneaked into a clandestine political meeting in this sweltering south-eastern city to watch the man they would come to know as “Amlo” preach revolution.“I remember him saying: ‘The country cannot go on being the personal property of four of five people,’” said Jaber, recalling that underground gathering in 1987, after which she promptly signed up to his cause.Before sending his followers out to spread the word, Jaber remembers Amlo offering a final prediction that night. “I am going to be the president of Mexico,” he told them.Thirty-one years later it appears he may have been right.With Mexico set to elect its next president on 1 July, Amlo – or Andrés Manuel López Obrador, to give him his full name – is in pole position.Polls give the silver-haired 64-year-old leftist – whose coalition bears the name Together We Will Make History – a commanding lead over his closest rival Ricardo Anaya, a 39-year-old lawyer who is heading a right-left coalition.The ruling Institutional Revolutionary party’s uninspiring candidate, José Antonio Meade, trails in third. On the campaign trail, Amlo, who is a friend of Jeremy Corbyn and his Mexican wife, Laura Álvarez, has pledged to wrest back control of the oil industry, explore an amnesty for those involved in Mexico’s devastating drug war, and challenge the country’s powerful and thieving “mafias”.That last message has found widespread support in a nation outraged and demoralised by jaw-dropping corruption scandals involving its ruling elite.“López Obrador is the only option,” Margarita García Rodriguez, a homemaker and mother of three, said during a recent Amlo rally in the industrial sprawl that encircles Mexico’s capital.“If he can’t help us out, then there’s nobody else that can. The whole system will collapse.”The prospect of a six-year Amlo presidency horrifies his many detractors and foes who paint him as an Hugo Chávez-style authoritarian and “tropical messiah” whose antiquated policies would ruin the Mexican economy.“He believes in old-fashioned nationalism. Old-fashioned statism. Old-fashioned protectionism. Old-fashioned subsidies across the board,” said Jorge Castañeda, one of Anaya’s two campaign chiefs and Mexico’s former foreign minister.“Is he a guy who is sufficiently pragmatic and intelligent to understand that you can’t do a lot of these things? Yeah. But what would he do if he could?”Amlo has sought to assuage such fears by naming a team of highly educated experts as his cabinet and promising business leaders there will be “no expropriations, no nationalisations” if he wins.He denies claims he is seeking to drag Latin America’s second largest economy back into the past. “If this horror we’re living now is what they want to give us in the future, the past is preferable,” Amlo told one recent rally. But as the clock ticks down to July’s election, Mexico’s answer to Project Fear is intensifying its operations in a last-ditch bid to thwart Amlo’s push for power. “This is a guy who is the wrong alternative for Mexico. He is tired, he is old, he is obsolete. He is surrounded by wackos and he has old ideas,” said Castañeda, a key figure in the often apocalyptic-sounding endeavour to derail Amlo’s campaign. “People don’t go to his rallies or listen or believe in him because he speaks intelligently or eloquently or charismatically. They go because of what he represents – the end of the system.”Amlo’s story begins in the Tabasco river town of Tepetitán, where he was born in November 1953, the first of seven children. Today, a bust of the town’s most famous son stands outside one of his childhood homes beside a plaque that declares him “El Rostro de la Esperanza” – “The Face of Hope”. Nicknamed “El Peje” after the pejelagarto, a feisty local fish, Amlo spent his early years playing baseball and tending to his father’s clothing store with his brother José Ramón, who later died after accidentally shooting himself with a revolver.He became politically active in the late 1970s, moving to Nacajuca, an area north of Tabasco’s capital, Villahermosa, that is home to the indigenous Chontal Maya people, to work as a local representative of the National Indigenous Institute.“López Obrador took on that role as if it was his destiny, with a missionary’s spirit,” writes José Agustín Ortiz Pinchetti in a flattering new biography of his friend called Amlo: With his Feet on the Ground. “He went to live in a shack just like the ones the indigenous families lived in.”Pinchetti recalls how during Amlo’s six years in the impoverished region, he and his family slept in hammocks and endured “African temperatures of over 40C” with nothing but a single fan to keep them cool. It was an experience that lit an “inner fire” within the young tabasqueño and made him determined see Mexico ruled for the many not the few. It also earned Amlo a considerable grassroots following. “Whatever he says, we believe. Whatever he says, he fulfils. He’s a man of his word,” said Glenda Jasso Aquino, a Chontal Maya woman who knew the presidential frontrunner at the time. “He’s more than a man … He’s going to be president to help his people, the earth, the countryside.”Jasso remembered Amlo taking on Mexico’s state-run oil company, Pemex, setting up protest camps outside its offices to force it to pay compensation to indigenous communities and campesinos whose lands it had polluted. “Amlo was the only person who raised his voice,” she said.From Tabasco, Amlo’s political quest eventually took him to the nation’s capital. In 2000 he was elected Mexico City’s mayor vowing to “put the poor first, for the wellbeing of all”. His administration proved popular: the left has crushed opponents in subsequent Mexico City elections. He subsidized subway fares, provided stipends for senior citizens and single mothers and built elevated expressways. Critics condemned such projects as populism, but promptly copied them in other parts of the country. “If you look at how he ran Mexico City, he was far from a radical,” said Carlos Bravo Regidor, professor at the Centre for Teaching and Research in Economics. As Amlo set about transforming Mexico’s capital, he also began eyeing the ultimate political prize, the presidency. He narrowly lost on his first attempt, in 2006, subsequently and controversially alleging that he had been the victim of electoral fraud and leading a months-long occupation of Mexico City’s political heart. In 2012 he was defeated again.Revolutionary or not, as election day approaches many analysts are convinced Amlo is in an unassailable position, even if one recent poll showed his main rival gaining ground. Castañeda said he was working 16-hour days to turn the race around and claimed his candidate, Anaya, had “a reasonable shot” at ensuring it was not third-time lucky for Amlo. Were a grand anti-Amlo coalition to coalesce in the coming weeks that could indeed be possible. However, Castañeda admitted there was now a “relatively big” gap between the candidates. Many Mexican voters were now so fed up with the system that they thought: “We just want to get rid of these guys and well, you know, let’s give him a try.”Amlo and his supporters are hoping that on 1 July they finally do."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481526.1525634953!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"house rules how to get your first mortgage","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThings which help demonstrate a borrower’s desirability to a bank include savings and paying rent.

This represented a 70 per cent increase over the pervious 10-year period.This would provide for prefab replacement, a “deep energy retrofit” of schools built prior to 2008, modernisation of science and PE facilities, and investment in digital technology over the coming years.This will also include the provision of 50 large scale school-building projects and 20,000 school places in new buildings to ensure every child has a school place.“In total, the department’s capital budget will increase from €745 million today to over €1.1 billion in 2021. This shows the huge priority that Government puts on education,” the spokesman added.Fianna Fáil’s education spokesman Thomas Byrne said was “astonishing” that up to 575 school building projects seemed to be “on hold indefinitely due to a lack of available funds”.“Pupils are being taught in substandard accommodation with a 25 per cent increase in the use of prefab classrooms,” he said.He added that Minister for Education Richard Bruton clearly needed additional funding."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3486216.1525632145!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tui may face hefty financial settlement over poaching claims","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tASTI members  picketing Rosmini Community College during a recent industrial dispute.  The union  lost about 2,000 members during a recent dispute. Photograph: Cyril Byrne The Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) may end up paying hundreds of thousands of euro to a rival union following allegations it “poached” more than 1,000 members.This follows an investigation into allegations by the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI) that many of its members were recruited by the TUI during an industrial dispute last year.Under industrial relations rules, unions are not permitted to take on members from each other during a dispute.A disputes committee established by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions – the umbrella body for the trade union movement – recently directed the TUI to write to 1,059 members and advise them they were recruited in breach of trade union rules. These members will be free to rejoin the ASTI.After a six-week period, the congress will meet both unions to determine how many have rejoined their former union.Arising from this, the TUI will be “required to make a financial settlement with the ASTI, which reflects the loss of membership subscriptions involved, if any”, according to internal records of the disputes’ committee’s findings.It says the general secretary of congress will be available to assist in determining the structure and size of the settlement.The development comes at a time when teachers’ unions are presenting a united front in tackling the two-tier pay gap.The ASTI lost more than €250,000 last year in revenue from the loss of about 2,000 members between 2016 and 2017. This saw the union’s overall membership fall to its lowest level in more than 15 years.The TUI’s membership, by contrast, increased by at least 1,200 last year, according to Department of Education figures based on the number of subscriptions taken at source from teachers’ salaries.Well-placed sources said while they expected some members may return to their former union, they anticipated many would opt to remain with the TUI.The TUI, which is entitled to appeal the findings, has previously declined to comment on the investigation.During a dispute last year, there was a financial incentive for TUI members to join the ASTI.This was because the ASTI was considered to have “repudiated” the Lansdowne Road pay deal in place at the time, which triggered losses for members worth thousands of euro in frozen pay and forfeited payments.The TUI, however, remained inside the pay deal and its members were unaffected by these penalties."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"NUI Galway and Maynooth University show \u0026lsquosolid foundation\u0026rsquo in tackling gender biasConcerns over Kevin Street Maldron hotel were \u0026lsquoignored and ridiculed\u0026rsquo, say localsFigure is double the number in 2016 and 11 of notices were on residential propertiesEmily O\u0026rsquoReilly says \u0026lsquo\u0026rsquo interview \u0026lsquochanged the narrative\u0026rsquo on teenager\u0026rsquos deathEoghan Murray confirms that Rory Mulcahy\u0026rsquos report has been on his desk since June 2017Basic building costs have increased by almost 40 per cent since 2014Surveillance of prisoners with mobile phones in prisons could be \u0026lsquoovert or covert\u0026rsquoKey allies back delaying talks on EU-UK deal until withdrawal treaty fully agreedEdmondstown Road in Rathfarnham closed since last year following alleged illegal workMan in his mid-30s fatally injured when his vehicle hit a pole in FinglasSenior housing officials say Public Private Partnerships too slow and expensiveFianna F\u0026aacuteil\u0026rsquos Robert Troy says \u0026lsquodrastic\u0026rsquo decrease in State funding \u0026lsquomakes no sense\u0026rsquoTeachers\u0026rsquo Union of Ireland told it should pay ASTI to make up for loss of membersTV presenter Robert Peston makes the claim during interview with Jacob Rees-MoggReports of desertions and attempted mutinies emerge from German intelligence reportsGroup embarks on 12-day trip to push for repeal of \u0026lsquounforgiving\u0026rsquo Eighth AmendmentYou can\u0026rsquot penalise people overnight for a change in government policy, says Naughten"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3486259.1525635180!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland a key pressure point at brexit summit barnier","story":"Speaking in Dundalk during a two-day visit to Ireland and Northern Ireland, EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has urged rapid agreement by June on the scope of any British alignment with the single market.

Photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReutersIreland will be used as a key pressure point at a crucial summit next month to force the UK to clarify its future relationship with the EU, Michel Barnier has said.In a private briefing in Brussels last week, the European Union’s chief negotiator also insisted Brexit does not threaten the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and asked for “drama” to be taken out of the Border proposals.In a briefing to representatives of the EU27, the bloc’s remaining member states, he said the risk of a breakdown in the talks later in the year will be heightened if there is no “early progress on Irish issues”. He was reporting on his recent trip to Northern Ireland and Ireland. An account of his briefing was sent to Dublin by Irish officials.The briefing, elements of which have been seen by The , says Germany and France support the position that talks must not progress to a future EU-UK deal unless all elements of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal treaty are agreed. This includes the so-called backstop, which would ensure no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland without agreed solutions on how to avoid a hard border.The EU has proposed this would mean Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union after Brexit. That has been rejected by the British prime minister, Theresa May, and the DUP, which supports her Conservative government in a confidence-and-supply deal at Westminster.“France also shared Barnier’s view on the need to reach agreement on outstanding withdrawal-agreement issues, including Ireland, by June,” the notes say. “Germany said it was essential that the Irish issue was not left ‘open to the end and then isolated’.”Mr Barnier said the EU “had specific leverage points” at European Council summits last December and March. “In June, the primary leverage point will be to make clear to the UK that finalising the outstanding aspects of the Withdrawal Agreement, ‘including on Ireland’, is a precondition to a constructive discussion on the future,” the account of his briefing said. Mr Barnier said the backstop does not affect the constitutional status of Northern Ireland but only sets out what checks are necessary after Brexit. He argued there are already checks between Britain and Northern Ireland for agricultural produce. “What he has learnt from his visit to IrelandNorthern Ireland is that all sides need to take the drama out of what is being proposed. Barnier repeatedly said he was moved by all communities in Ireland.”Speaking yesterday, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said Northern Ireland must “move in lockstep” with the rest of the United Kingdom. “We don’t believe we have to stay in the customs union to have free flow between ourselves and the Republic of Ireland.”A decision on the British government’s preferred customs option has been postponed after Ms May failed to secure the support of her ministers for a proposed hybrid “customs partnership” between the EU and UK. The arrangement would see British officials collect tariffs on behalf of the European Union for any goods coming to the UK that were subsequently destined for an EU member state. Such a proposal has already been rejected by Brussels.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/06/TELEMMGLPICT000162447754_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqyuLFFzXshuGqnr8zPdDWXiTUh73-1IAIBaONvUINpkg.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"britains unpopular railway station revealed","story":"Passengers described the station in Glasgow as a \u0026#39disaster\u0026#39A third world railway station where passengers are too embarrassed to take friends and relatives has been revealed as Britain\u0027s most unpopular.Only 58 per cent of passengers said they were “satisfied” with Glasgow Queen Street, according to a survey conducted by the independent rail watchdog Transport Focus.The survey was conducted between September and November last year, shortly after a £100 million modernisation project began at the city centre terminal.Passenger Cameron MacIntosh, 32, a sales adviser from Stirling, said: The station is an absolute bomb site at the moment.

Some believe she was buried in Amarna, an ancient capital city founded by Pharaoh Akhenaten.The claims of a secret chamber ignited global interest, as officials first rushed to support the new theory but then later distanced themselves before ultimately rejecting it.The ministry says two previous scans by Japanese and American scientists had proved inconclusive, but insists this latest ground-penetrating radar data closes the lid on the tomb having such hidden secrets.The ministry has been gradually moving King Tut\u0027s belongings to a new museum outside Cairo near the Giza Pyramids to undergo restoration before they are put on display.The transfer of the priceless belongings has become a particularly sensitive issue In 2014 the beard attached to the ancient Egyptian monarch\u0027s golden mask was accidentally knocked off and hastily reattached with an epoxy glue compound, sparking uproar among archaeologists.King Tutankhamun\u0026#39s golden sarcophagus displayed at his tomb in a glass case at the Valley of the Kings in Luxor, EgyptThe fourth International Tutankhamun Conference in Cairo where Dr Porcelli presented the findings, the most extensive radar survey of the site to date, was attended by a wide range of Egyptologists and archaeologists from the world over.During the conference, Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Anani said that the first phase of the new museum, including King Tut\u0027s halls, will be completed by the end of this year but the date for the museum\u0027s soft opening has yet to be decided.The museum currently hosts more than 43,200 artifacts of which over 4,500 belong to King Tut alone, and its grand opening is planned for 2022. UK weather: Britain set to hit 28C in record-breaking Bank Holiday heatBehind the shutter: Patrícia de Melo Moreira on photographing Portugal\u0026#39s infernoTory MP Johnny Mercer: My battles with mental illness - and how Army veterans are being exploited and failedMillennials \u0026#39have no qualms about GM crops\u0026#39 unlike older generationOn this day in 1945: The Germans surrender in World War TwoComment: A disgrace to the job... but \u0026#39Bully\u0026#39 Bercow still has his uses in ParliamentNearly 200 horses found dead on Navajo land in drought-hit Arizona Boris Johnson warns Trump that abandoning Iran nuclear deal could spark \u0026#39dash for a bomb\u0026#39Hizbollah on course to tighten grip on Lebanon, according to early resultsDonald Trump\u0026#39s pick to run the CIA, Gina Haspel, offered to withdraw over \u0026#39torture\u0026#39 roleBoys aged 13 and 15 shot on high street in north-west LondonCampaigners warn against sale of fields and green spaces which \u0026#39save NHS more than £100 million a year\u0026#39Toxic gas follows molten lava as erupting Hawaii volcano destroys homes\u0026#39Mob fixer\u0026#39 who stopped gangster terrorising Steven Gerrard shot dead by gunman on a bikeRudy Giuliani says other women might have been paid off by Trump attorney \u0026#39if necessary\u0026#39Israel prepared to go to war to block Iran in Syria, say Benjamin Netanyahu The Woman in White, episode 4 recap: Is Marian a Victorian Lara Croft? 17 British sperm donors have fathered more than 500 children between them, figures showGrandparents could be given legal right to see their grandchildren after orceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"asda sainsburys merger deal latest job losses new economics foundation","story":"Supermarket boss has promised 10 per cent price cuts for customersUp to 2,500 jobs in supply chains could be at risk from the proposed merger of Asda and Sainsbury’s, the New Economics Foundation has warned.

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that.

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They are making a big decision as to where the next motor plant should be in Europe.“We have a very successful one in Deeside, in North Wales, but there are choices as to whether that should be located on the continent. “Between that plant and the plant in Derbyshire there are 3,500 people employed. The nature of that business is that over 50 per cent of the parts come from out of the country. They come through every hour of the day and night ... It’s just in time manufacturing. It is highly efficient. “What we have always said is we will have a customs agreement that has the minimum of frictions. Now that is crucial.”Tory rebels: We can push May towards single market, if Labour backs usBank of America moving 125 UK jobs to Ireland because of Brexit ‘Manual workarounds’ plan over fears IT systems not ready for BrexitBrexit blamed for weak services growth in AprilMs May’s customs plans will help firms as it would mean you can import parts without border checks or paperwork, he said.Mr Clark added: “But it’s not perfect, because what it means is that if we have imports from other countries where we’ve abolished the tariff, there has to be an arrangement where you pay back.”He also opened the door to extending a transition period on customs with the EU, saying it could be a case of implementing a new customs arrangement “as soon as you can do” rather than 2020 when the transition would expire.It could take until 2023 to put new infrastructure in place, he added.Former home secretary Amber Rudd, who resigned last week over the Windrush scandal, immediately tweeted her support of Mr Clark’s plans.Business leaders also welcomed Mr Clark’s comments, saying it was important to maintain the status quo on frictionless trade until a new arrangement is in place.However Mr Rees-Mogg, chairman of the powerful European Research Group (ERG) of Tory Brexiteers, said it would be “odd” for Ms May to back a policy that effectively breached her commitment on leaving both the customs union and single market.He told ITV’s Peston on Sunday: “This Project Fear has been so thoroughly discredited that you would have thought it would have come to an end by now.“We trade successfully all over the world.

He lived his last years exiled in London, where he authored the Communist Manifesto, his best-known work.All the ways in which Marx was unexpectedly right“Karl Marx was a philosopher, who thought into the future had creative aspirations, and today he stands for things, which is he not responsible for and which he didn\u0027t cause, because many of the things he wrote down were redrafted into the opposite,” Mr Juncker said in a speech at a church in Trier.“One has to understand Karl Marx from the context of his time and not have prejudices based on the review, these judgements shouldn\u0027t exist. Karl Marx was lucky in life as he was born in Trier. He grew up in the city, actually the shortest period of his vita.”Drawing on the philosopher’s legacy, Mr Juncker said the European Union’s instability could be addressed by focusing more on social welfare, which he said had been a neglected part of European integration so far.“It will be a task of our time to create a lively reality out of the social rights we set up for Europe, for the ones who live today and often are sad or blackmailed by life and won\u0027t have enough social rights and the ones, who will be born tomorrow,” he said.Marx\u0027s birthday is being celebrated across the world(AP)“The European Union is not a flawed, but an unstable construction. Unstable also because Europe\u0027s social dimension until today remains the poor relation of the European integration. We have to change this.”A former student of the philosopher Hegel, Marx developed the theory of historical materialism which he argued explained the development of human society and the development of social classes. His work argues that capitalism’s creation of a mass of workers who owned no property will be its downfall.

I was told there’s no need to see anyone or a specialist\u0027Katie Holley was jolted awake by a cold thing – what she had initially thought was a small piece of ice that somehow slid down her left ear. Still disoriented, she rushed to the bathroom, grabbed a cotton swab and slowly stuck it inside her ear. And then Ms Holley felt something move. It was like a “rhythmic” movement, she recalled, as whatever it was tried to burrow deeper into her ear canal.She pulled out the cotton swab and saw small, dark brown pieces that looked like legs.Cockroaches have been a nuisance in the Holley household since she and her husband, Jordan Holley, bought their first home last year, she wrote in Self magazine this week. They thrive in warm and damp places and that includes Florida, where the young couple live and where flying cockroaches called palmetto bugs are most common. Households in warm cities, such as New Orleans, Houston and Atlanta, report more problems with cockroaches than much of the country.Woman discovers cockroach in Air India loungeWhite House infested with cockroaches, mice and ants, documents revealDoctors find live cockroach in woman’s skullA few weeks earlier, an exterminator sprayed every room inside the couple’s house in Melbourne, Florida and Ms Holley felt what turned out to be a very temporary sense of relief.That morning, around 1.45am on 14 April, Mr Holley rushed to the bathroom to help his panicking wife, grabbed a flashlight and looked inside her ear. And there it was, a small part still visible from the outside as it stayed there, lodged in the middle of the ear canal. Mr Holley managed to pull out a couple of legs using a pair of tweezers, but the intrepid bug had crawled too deep.The young couple drove to the emergency room just a few miles away. A man sitting behind a desk near the hospital’s entrance saw the look of panic in Ms Holley’s face and asked whether she was in pain.“A roach crawled into my ear while I was sleeping and it was stuck,” Ms Holley said she told him.She was given a wristband and taken to a room, where she lay on her side on a gurney, whimpering. A nurse injected the bug with the anaesthetic lidocaine to try to kill it. Ms Holley said she felt the roach move, twitching and wriggling further into her ear as it tried to avoid death. Two minutes later, it stopped moving.It took the doctor about 20 seconds to pull out chunks of the dead roach and Ms Holley saw what she thought was the remains of a small insect. She left the hospital nearly two hours later with a prescription for antibiotics and ear drops, relieved that it was all over. She and her husband vowed to never let the experience happen again, stopping by a Walmart to buy earplugs.Nine days passed, but Ms Holley’s ear still did not feel normal. It was still numb, she said and she felt some discomfort every time she yawned. Her medicine drops also had stopped passing through her ear, leading her to think that perhaps earwax had built up inside.She went to her physician for her regularly scheduled appointment and asked the doctor whether she could check her ear. Her doctor and a physician assistant flushed her ear four times. Using an otoscope, they peeked inside and there it was – another leg.Lord of the butterflies: Clive Farrell has turned his Dorset estate into an insect-filled fantasiaLord of the butterflies: Clive Farrell has turned his Dorset estate into an insect-filled fantasiaMs Holley’s doctor pulled out six pieces of the roach’s remains – but feared there was still more left. Ms Holley said her physician arranged for her to see a doctor who specialises in treating the ears, nose and throat (ENT) later that day.As she went home and waited, Ms Holley tried to remember how much of the roach was taken out at the emergency room more than a week ago.“Did they find the head? Antennae?” she wrote. “I couldn’t recall. But I could only hope that the ENT would only need to remove another teensy leg or two.”The specialist placed what looked like a microscope next to Ms Holley’s face. A few minutes later, she felt something bigger was getting extracted out of her ear canal. And then she saw it. Not a “teensy leg or two”. Not the remains of a baby roach. But a head, a torso, limbs and long antennae of what looked like a fully grown palmetto bug.For nine days, much of the dead roach sat in Ms Holley’s ear.“I was furious. I was really disappointed with the ER for not having seen that, for letting me believe it was all out,” Ms Holley, a 29-year-old sales and marketing manager, said on Saturday. “They said this is something that happens often. I was told there’s no need to see anyone or a specialist.”Scientists create robotic cockroach to search disaster areasHolley declined to name the hospital she first went to in April.Holley said she did not have any permanent damage or infection. Palmetto bugs generally do not bite and if they do, their bites are not harmful.Cockroaches have been known to burrow into people’s ears. A South African hospital, for example, pulled two dozen critters out of people’s ears over a period of two years, according to a National Geographic article published last year.“Roaches are searching for food everywhere,” entomologist Coby Schal of North Carolina State University told National Geographic. “And earwax might be appealing to them.”But, still, as Ms Holley said: “It was still a roach. In my ear.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account? Log inWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

It is estimated between just 30 and 40 per cent voted in some areas of Beirut, the country’s National News Agency reported, with voters reportedly frustrated with the country’s stagnating economy and apathetic about the main political parties. The elections are the first since war broke out in neighbouring Syria in 2011, sending over one million refugees to Lebanon, a country with an estimated total population of just 4.5 million. The war has ided the country, pitting parties supporting the Iran-sponsored Hezbollah’s intervention in Syria to aide President Bashar Assad against Saudi-aligned parties opposed to it.Hezbollah is expected to emerge stronger after the elections, a result that would affirm Tehran’s regional ascendancy from its own borders to the Mediterranean.Sunni Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri is the frontrunner to keep his job and form a new coalition government.Lebanon holds first elections in almost a decade Former sniper’s lair is chilling reminder of Lebanon’s civil warUS pledges support for Lebanon’s army after Israeli ‘Hezbollah’ claimPiles of rubbish wash up on Beirut beach amid national waste crisisFor the younger generations it was the first opportunity to vote in a national election after parliament twice extended a term that expired in 2013. Early on voting day, reports suggested turnout would be low and President Michel Aoun appeared on television late in the afternoon to urge people to vote.Although the election used a new proportional system, many voters said they expected the country’s entrenched, sectarian elite to remain on top, but others were optimistic.“We hope we will open a new era,” said Mahmoud Daouk, voting in Beirut in one of the areas where new faces were taking on the old sectarian elite.The vote was held under a new proportional system that has confused some voters and made the contest more unpredictable.But it still preserves a sectarian power-sharing system and another coalition government including most of the major parties, like the one Mr Hariri has led since 2016, looks likely, analysts say.While foreign monitors gave a generally positive assessment, tensions flared in several locations. Missiles were thrown during street clashes in Beirut, a candidate claimed her car was attacked in the Bekaa Valley town of Zahle, and rival groups clashed in the northern city of Tripoli.Lebanon holds first elections in almost a decadeInvestors are keen to see a government in place quickly as a guarantee of economic stability. Lebanon has one of the world’s highest debt-to-GDP ratios and the International Monetary Fund has said its fiscal trajectory is unsustainable.“The situation is actually worse now, not better ... We lost the chance to hold them accountable nine years ago,” said Fatima Kibbi, 33, a pharmacist.Informal results are expected to start coming in overnight and official tallies in the coming days.Analysts are closely watching the performance of Mr Hariri’s Future Movement party and that of the Shia Hezbollah group and its allies.Iran and Saudi Arabia have often battled for influence in Lebanon as part of their wider regional rivalry. An anti-Hezbollah alliance led by Mr Hariri and backed by Saudi Arabia won the majority in 2009.But the anti-Hezbollah alliance known as March 14 has disintegrated since then and Riyadh has turned its focus and resources to confronting Iran in other parts of the region.Alhough Hezbollah’s opponents still want it to disarm, the demand has slipped down the political agenda. Lebanese leaders are mostly concerned with a dire economic situation and the strain of hosting 1 million Syrian refugees.Donors pledged $11bn (£8bn) in soft loans for a capital investment programme last month, in return for fiscal and other reforms, and they hope to hold the first follow-up meeting with the new government in the coming weeks.Debt ratings agencies had stressed the importance of Lebanon going ahead with the election after parliament had extended its term several times.After the last election in 2009, the onset of Syria’s civil war, the arrival of over a million refugees and a series of militant attacks aggravated internal political rifts.Rival blocs in parliament could not agree on a new president between 2014-16 and repeatedly decided to delay elections, partly because of a disagreement over moving from a winner-takes-all system to a proportional one.The new rules are seen as unlikely to undermine the long-entrenched political elite, a group that includes local dynasties and former warlords.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesRussian police carrying struggling opposition leader Alexei Navalny at a demonstration against President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.

But the more things change, the more they stay the same\u0026nbspLebanon is a colourful place at the moment. Spring has been unusually warm the hillsides above Beirut are green and the pink and purple blossom of bougainvillea and jacaranda trees drift down onto the city’s streets.  The plethora of new political flags and posters, however, is definitely more eye-catching.  On Sunday Lebanon’s erse population of six million will cast their votes for the first time since 2009 in a national election which should end almost a decade of political gridlock.Lebanon Prime Minister Saad Hariri says resignation on hold awaiting talksThe new elections come with a set of complicated new rules designed to move Lebanon towards a proportionally representative system for the first time, allowing space for more independents and reducing the power of establishment blocs formed by the country’s multiconfessional political system.Critics, however, say that since the new electoral law asks voters to pick lists of allied sects and parties, as well as prioritise inidual candidates on the list of their choice, it accentuates the already isive tendencies of Lebanon’s complex politics by making candidates on the same slates compete with each other. “Like almost every law on the books in Lebanon, the way it looks on paper is very different to how it is applied or fairly administered in practice,” said Imad Salameh, a professor of politics at Beirut’s Lebanese American University. “We are injecting into the normal proportional system this Lebanese twist. Parliament is unlikely to change too much. But it is a step in the right direction.”Lebanon’s politics – which involves 18 officially represented sectarian groups – is famously complicated. The filth and the fury: A mountain of rubbish is blighting Lebanon\u0027s once-beautiful beachesThe filth and the fury: A mountain of rubbish is blighting Lebanon\u0027s once-beautiful beachesIn the Christian villages just below the cedar forests of north Lebanon’s Tannourine, huge posters of the Christian president, Michel Aoun, are currently hung underneath tens of Shia Hezbollah’s distinctive yellow flag, green fists brandishing AK-47s.  Some of the country’s more surprising political partnerships – such as that of the recently elected Mr Aoun and Lebanon’s Sunni prime minister, Saad Hariri – say a lot about how Lebanon’s internal politics are still intrinsically linked to its position in the region and the Middle East’s wider power struggles. Lebanese media has been dominated in recent weeks by pundits angry that the country’s biggest issues – the heavily indebted economy, the disarmament of Hezbollah, Syrian refugees and crises in public services such as electricity and garbage – have for the most part been sidelined by the major parties, who are too preoccupied with forging allegiances to maintain the status quo to assure voters they will do what’s best for the country.Analysts believe that the reaction of Iran and the administration of US President Donald Trump – both of which have proxy interests in Lebanon – will depend on other events across the region.“The problem is, the Trump administration and Iran will treat the election results depending on so many other factors,” said Mohaned Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Centre. US pledges support for Lebanon’s army after Israeli ‘Hezbollah’ claimPiles of rubbish wash up on Beirut beach amid national waste crisisThe Boustani house encompasses both the tragedy and faith of LebanonSaudi Arabia has threatened Lebanese stability in the past“There’s so much happening in May in the region alone. We will still be counting the votes, probably, when Trump pulls out of the Iran deal, and Iraq holds its own elections, which may change a lot in the Shia power balance there. “Our future is dependent on many variables outside our control.”The rest of the Middle East casts a long shadow on the tiny country. Internally, so do ongoing rows over gerrymandering, conflicts of interest, party funding and the steep cost for independents for running a slate.Despite all that, however, there is still a sense of optimism among many young people in Lebanon – 800,000 of whom are excited to cast a vote for the first time. Art exhibition in Lebanon shut down by people trying to erase imperialism from their historyA record number of women are running this year and civil society movements aimed at educating people about their democratic rights are flourishing. “The best way of looking at these elections is: they are an exercise for the new blood in Lebanese politics and new candidates and movements popping up everywhere to try contest the sectarian establishment and elite,” said Mr Ali. “It is building up some sort of new independent movement for the next round. It’s a long process, and there’s a long way to go.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

A vibrant metropolis, at ease with its diverse, tolerant self.A shining example to the world of how folk from different backgrounds and cultures can rub along together.At least, that’s what we’re invited to believe. But the truth is this depiction of our capital city is not one recognised by millions of its citizens. That’s because London is, in fact, a tale of two cities.There are the gentrified hotbeds of liberal cosmopolitanism — the Islingtons and Camdens — top-heavy with the professional classes and cultural elites, the type of areas that were a bedrock of Remain support in the EU referendum.But then there are those places outside the bubble. On the one hand the grittier, traditional working-class areas — the Canning Towns and Bermondseys — populated by those steamrollered by globalisation, for whom austerity and mass immigration have exacerbated the problems of low wages, poor housing and under-pressure public services.On the other, the middle-class suburbs — the Upminsters and Eastcotes — inhabited by those who sense that their “small c” conservatism is increasingly incongruous with the image of their city as a beacon of progressive modernity.It is between these places that a new and unintended coalition has emerged, born out of resentment at having  to watch their old-fashioned, socially conservative — what some describe as “faith, family and flag” — views shunned and disparaged by the liberal elite.You can see something similar writ large across England: An accidental alliance between once-loyal Labour voters in the post-industrial towns and Conservatives in the shires.It’s an alliance which manifested itself most starkly in the Brexit vote.For the Londoners that fall within these groups, their city is not the harmonious and cohesive ideal seen through the eyes of the chattering classes.It is, instead, a place increasingly atomised, where millions feel a diminishing sense of belonging and in which entire communities within a few hundred yards of each other live utterly parallel lives.Take, for example, the borough in which I grew up, Barking and Dagenham.As working-class as it gets, it was once the very essence of a traditional Labour heartland. Never affluent, but stable, close-knit and settled.Centred around a sprawling 1930s council estate and with generally healthy levels of employment — the dominant Ford factory being at the heart of local industry — Barking and Dagenham enjoyed its steady constancy, its social and cultural familiarity.For those short on money and opportunity, the concepts of place, belonging, identity and relationships take on so much more meaning.But then things changed. Over a few very short years, around the turn of the century, there was a sizeable influx of migrants, precipitating rapid social and cultural transformation.The demographic convulsions meant stable, settled Barking and Dagenham found itself in the eye of the storm of the debate over mass immigration.The indigenous population cried out for respite. The letters page of the local paper was filled with correspondents begging to be heard. But nobody in power took a blind bit of notice, other than to patronise them with trite arguments about improved GDP and cultural enrichment.Rather than rally to their support, the Left — including, shamefully, the Labour Party and trade unions — treated these marginalised working-class folk like an embarrassing elderly relative, imploring them to “stop blaming migrants” (something they hadn’t done in the first place).What was genuine bewilderment and disorientation on the part of local citizens was, inexcusably, dismissed as casual racism and bigotry.Yet it wasn’t their sense of race that had been violated by the sudden upheaval in their community. It was their sense of order.So, in 2006, locals took the only route of protest they thought left available to them and returned  12 British National Party councillors at the local elections.The noxious far-Right, which previously had never gained a foothold in the borough (though it had penetrated areas close by) now formed the official opposition on Barking and Dagenham council, not because thousands of locals had overnight turned into vile racists, but because they had repeatedly been ignored by a tin-eared establishment.But even then, nothing changed. Locals were told to get with the zeitgeist.Women in their eighties who had lived in the borough for most of their lives, had raised  families there and in many cases now lived a life of lonely isolation, were told to embrace the vibrancy of the new multiculturalism.That was the level of condescension to which the liberal establishment had sunkSo thousands of people simply upped sticks and left. In the first decade of the new century, Barking and Dagenham experienced a vast exodus of families who had been rooted in its streets, workplaces and  institutions for generations.It was the only home that many had ever known, but they went all the same. They departed for the Essex coast or Kent. It wasn’t “white flight”, for skin colour was irrelevant to most of them.It was, instead, a flight to familiarity.The tragedy was that most of these people never were anti-immigration. They would not have objected to the integration of a modest and manageable number of arrivals over a reasonable period.But the whole debate around immigration has been toxified by what the ruling elites imposed on places such as Barking and Dagenham.They shook a kaleidoscope then stood back in surprise when the pieces didn’t fall exactly where they wanted. Remember all this the next time you hear someone speak of London as the greatest city in the world.Chances are the words are being spoken by a politician or a celebrity or a middle-class liberal from one of the trendier parts of town.For there are, in reality, two Londons. One half — alienated, neglected and resentful — represents a potentially formidable army at the ballot box.Who will speak for it?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, the customs partnership idea, which would involve the UK collecting tariff revenues on the EU’s behalf, would make the UK a much less attractive country to do trade deals with.To be fully effective, it would also  require the UK  to essentially copy all EU regulations on goods.With the scheme also leading to the European Court of Justice getting involved in Britain’s affairs, it would not be “taking back control”.But even after the remarkable rebuff it received from the Brexit inner Cabinet on Wednesday, despite the Prime Minister putting her authority on the line by making clear her support for it, No10 won’t give up on the idea. It believes that, with a few changes, it can be made to work.Ministers are now bracing themselves for a huge effort from Theresa May’s allies to get them to change their minds.Already, No10 is telling ministers that what really matters is getting out, and that once the UK is no longer a member of the EU, all these problems can be ironed out at a later date.I understand that one minister has even been warned that the whole Brexit project might collapse without a customs partnership.The argument is that there is “no deal” without a customs partnership, which the Government views as being  key to solving the Irish border question.Without a deal, Parliament could turn on Brexit.The Chief Whip has also told Cabinet colleagues that he hasn’t got the votes to defeat a customs union amendment in the Commons. So, the best way to see that off is to embrace a customs partnership instead.But the local election results show that the Tory vote is becoming more and more Leave dominated. Number crunchers estimate that 70 per cent of Tory voters are leavers.As one influential Tory warns, this means that if Mrs May loses Brexit Secretary David Davis or Boris Johnson from the Cabinet over the customs partnership “and is seen to be selling out Brexit, the Tories will be utterly screwed electorally”.Another problem with the customs partnership idea is the message it sends the EU.As one insider tells me: “The EU is trying to force us into a false choice between a customs union and no deal — and we’re encouraging that by not being clear enough in our negotiating position.”Rather than trying to pressure ministers into backing her customs partnership idea, Mrs May should tell the  EU she wants a free trade  deal with sensible customs arrangements that keeps red tape to a minimum.Once she has been clear, she might find the EU more willing to negotiate.THE country is there for the taking. The local election results show neither Labour nor the Tories are able to break the political stalemate.If these results were replicated at a General Election, we would have another hung parliament.It is easy to declare that the country is permanently split, and that’s why no party can win a big majority. But I don’t think that’s right.Rather, the problem is that neither Labour nor the Tories are capable of reaching out.If Labour was led by a working-class leader from the Midlands who stood up for the country, then they would be on course for a proper majority. Equally, if the Tories were led by a Brexiteer whose upbeat, optimistic vision could appeal in Remain areas then they would be beating Corbyn comfortably.  Indeed, these local election results suggest that Labour under Corbyn has stalled – that it hasn’t kept up the progress it made in last year’s General Election.Now, Labour are highly unlikely to change leader before the next election.Jeremy Corbyn and his allies have seized control of the commanding heights of the Labour Party, and the new members who so fervently believe in him wouldn’t back a challenge to him whatever Labour MPs do.But the Tories will almost certainly change their leader before 2022. These results are a reminder that they need to show  they have delivered on Brexit by the time of the next election. Government whips have been calling round to ask Tory MPs what they think of handing the  NHS a funding boost on its 70th birthday in July, and how they would pay for it.These results suggest they would be well advised to portray this money as the beginning of the Brexit dividend for the health service.This might stick in the craw of Tory Remainers, but  voters now expect them to deliver on Brexit promises.When the Tories pick their new leader they need to go for someone with cross-over appeal – someone who can firm up their support among Leave voters but reach out to Remainers too.I am told that Bercow, who is currently under pressure over bullying allegations, doesn’t feel   he can say this publicly. But I am assured that this is his plan. It remains to be seen whether the knowledge that Bercow will go  will curtail calls for him to quit.Many in the Commons feel  the claims against him must be properly investigated if Parliament is to show  it is serious about protecting its  staff. Senior figures in Government are also keen to see the back of  him because they suspect him of encouraging Labour’s use of an arcane procedural device – “a humble address” – to try to winkle embarrassing information out of ministers.PENNY MORDAUNT presented to Cabinet on the gender pay gap this week.She turned in an assured performance less than 24 hours after being appointed minister for women and equalities, telling ministers to demand a plan to close the gender pay gap from the sectors covered by their department.But as one female Cabinet minister points out, no one mentioned the elephant in  the room – the fact that the second most senior woman  in the Cabinet had to quit  her job, only to be replaced by a man.Only five of the 23 full members of the Cabinet are women.  The Government might want to concentrate  on improving this balance before they lecture business any more.PHILIP HAMMOND and Michael Gove are clashing over the powers of the post-Brexit environmental regulator.The Environment Secretary wants it to have the  same power to hold the Government to account that the European Commission  has.  But the Chancellor is sceptical. Senior Treasury figures tell me he does not think it is sensible or necessary to continue these restraints post-Brexit.The dispute is causing some raised eyebrows. One Whitehall source describes it as part of the “constant war” between the pair.  The two obviously disagree on Brexit.But Hammond is also deeply unenthusiastic about Gove’s green agenda.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

so why has Southern failed to provide enough rail replacement buses?Well be working with the operator to find out what went wrong and to ensure that passengers arent left high and dry next time they plan a trip to the seaside on a weekend."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403935399.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"madeleine mccann gp sighting waste","story":"Julian Totman walked near the McCanns’ apartment holding his two-year-old girl after getting her from a creche at the resort in Praia da Luz.But Portuguese officers continued to pursue the line of inquiry triggered by Jane Tanner, a friend of Kate and Gerry McCann.She said she saw a dark-haired man wearing a brown jacket, dark shoes and tan trousers carrying a child in pink and white pyjamas.As well as matching much of the physical description of “Tannerman”, Dr Totman also wore the same clothes.He was interviewed by the Guarda Nacional Republicana soon after Maddie, three, vanished in May 2007, but his wife Rachel said: “My husband had told the local police it could be him but we didn’t hear anything for years.“When the police finally realised the significance it was too late to really help.“We always thought it was Julian who was seen by Jane Tanner.But the national police who investigated didn’t get back to us and we don’t know if our information was ever passed on.”Ms Tanner was one of the so-called Tapas Seven — the friends and family members dining with the McCanns at the time Maddie disappeared.She was on her way to check on her kids at 9.15pm when she saw the man near Kate and Gerry’s apartment.Gerry was nearby with pal Jeremy Wilkins having just looked in on Maddie and her younger twin siblings Sean and Amelie.Kate then discovered their eldest child was missing when she went to check again at 10pm.Ms Tanner later defied police orders to not comment publicly on what she saw.She said: “I think it’s important that people know what I saw because I believe Madeleine was abducted.’’And with Portuguese laws prohibiting the release of photofits of suspects, the McCanns put out an artist’s sketch of “Tannerman” in October 2007.But efforts by the Totmans, who live in the South West, to point out the importance of Julian’s movements fell on deaf ears.They were never contacted by Leicestershire police, whose officers were responsible at the time for collating all UK inquiries.The force also failed to follow up on information from Paul and Julia Weinberger, pals of the Totmans, who said they had seen a pock-faced man hanging around the McCanns’ aparment twice that week.The Portuguese probe was concluded in July 2008 and it was not until 2011 — when then-Home Secretary Theresa May ordered the Met carry out a review — that the Totmans’ account was finally taken seriously.Det Chief Insp Andy Redwood described it as a “moment of revelation”.He said: “We are almost certain now this sighting [Tannerman] is not the abductor.”The Met probe then dramatically shifted focus to a sighting by Irishman Martin Smith at 10pm of a man — dubbed “Smithman” — carrying a child down a hill away from the Ocean Club.They also appealed for information over a spate of burglaries at the resort in the period leading up to Maddie’s disappearance 11 years ago last week.The British police investigation has now been scaled down and is likely to be shelved in October.But one retired Met Police detective, who visited the resort with The Sun, is convinced Jane Tanner saw the real abductor.Ian Horrocks said the man Ms Tanner saw had been walking from west to east, while Dr Totman would have gone the opposite way.He added: “The police seemingly dismissed this sighting after discovering the account of the British holidaymaker taking his daughter back to their apartment.“I cannot see how it can be totally dismissed.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, these are the views of Labour’s Big Beasts on the Marxist puppet who stole their party.Brighty - The SunThursday’s local elections suggest Brexit will be the battlefield for the next election, with Labour alienating millions who voted Leave.Alastair Campbell and David Blunkett led the attack on Jeremy Corbyn, blaming him for allowing Jew-baiting anarchists and union paymaster Len McCluskey to kill Labour’s dream of power.“If we cannot beat this shambles of a Tory party, we don’t deserve to be in the game,” warned Tony Blair’s old spin doctor.Campbell, a ferocious Remainer, tore into Corbyn for missing open goals over Brexit, Windrush deportees, the Grenfell inferno and the never- ending NHS ­crisis.But he is especially appalled by Labour’s “Militant-style nastiness . . . anti-Semitism . . . and the feeling that some in the leader- ship feel greater animus against Labour supporters than the Tories.”Blunkett’s attack is even more personal. “Jeremy’s ­leadership is going nowhere,” he warns.The ex-Home Secretary blamed Corbyn directly for the wave of anti-Semitism that cost Labour dearly in London and the reign of terror against anyone who dared to speak out.“He could have cauterised the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader,” fumed Blunkett. “He has fudged and prevaricated.“I’ve seen the personal vitriol activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from Len McCluskey.“I’ve seen good Labour MPs traduced and insulted.”Such vicious public attacks from Blairite heroes make nonsense of pundits’ claims that nothing has changed since last week. Labour is in meltdown.Tories bracing themselves for humiliation on Thursday night were let off the hook. Labour’s retreat across swathes of ­Britain prove JC will never be PM. Labour should be 20 points ahead, not level-pegging.They are lumbered with their useless leader. The legion of “Oh Jeremy Corbyn” fans adore him. And who would take over if he stepped aside?Not John McDonnell, for sure.This new blame game exposes the quiet but corrosive civil war tearing Labour apart since Jezza seized the crown.Last year, moderates had been secretly plotting a leadership coup on the assumption Labour would lose the General Election.That was before JC emerged startled but triumphant from Theresa May’s “strong and stable” fiasco.Now the knives are out. And Brexit is splitting Labour as much as it is the Tories.Ex-Europe minister Caroline Flint ripped into Corbyn for siding with Brexit wreckers and using the issue to bash the Tories. Intriguingly, she believes Britain would have voted OUT whenever the referendum was staged in the last ten years — even if Labour had been in power.Now she believes Remainers should accept the voters’ ­verdict and help deliver the best Brexit deal possible.The Doncaster MP aimed her remarks at Corbyn but she might as easily have been talking about Alastair Campbell, who is campaigning for a ­second referendum.“Two-thirds of Labour MPs represent Leave-voting areas,” says Ms Flint. “We are alienating many traditional Labour voters.”Even Corbyn’s own supporters want him to ditch his opportunistic sabotage tactics.Steve Howell, who helped run his 2017 election bid, ­predicted a voter backlash with Labour shut out of power for a decade.“Labour is seen as too Remain,” he said. “We ignore this at our peril. We would hand Leave-voting areas over to the Tories and be destroyed at the next General Election.”Thursday’s elections prove voters of all parties are sick of Westminster shenanigans and will punish the party they blame most for a bad Brexit.Right now, that looks like Labour.“I feel pity for the women and contempt for the men,” she writes. “The man walking in pride, showing us his caught prey.“The law of this country, the law of all countries, should change. Covering a face is literally killing an identity. I would love to see men covered with burkas, for a few hours, when it’s hot.“Let’s ask them, ‘How are you feeling? Good?’”This heatwave Bank Holiday is the perfect chance to try this experiment, chaps.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We hope we can continue meeting Mrs Leighs banking needs.Bradfords ancient plumbing system means age-old buildings often dump waste into its subterranean becks, with some establishments having their washing-up pipes not yet directed to the sewer system.This meant that diligent staff cleaning their dishes were also flooding the Bradford Beck, a river which feeds into Yorkshires River Aire, with leftover curry.The city boasts 200 Asian restaurants and employs almost 100,000 in the industry.The large Asian population of the city is down to the demand for immigrants during the Industrial Revolution when the textile industry was thriving and Bradford needed more manpower."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000381027118.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"junior doctors job offers retracted","story":"Some candidates were given the wrong interview marks as data was moved between IT systems.The British Medical Association (BMA) said it was appalled to discover the blunder, and that it had caused extreme anxiety for trainees.The Royal College of Physicians blamed human error and will rerun the process from May 14.Some junior medics were due to start the jobs offered within months.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was that Brexit would be effortless, a trouble-free stroll from across the Channel to spread prosperity and the return to a pith-helmeted Empire era.  Trade Secretary Liam Fox’s “easiest in human history” trade deal with the rest of Europe is an expensive nightmare, with Business Secretary Greg Clark warning yesterday that 3,500 Toyota jobs are at risk. The closer the clock ticks to deadlines, the scarier the Brextremists who are prepared to lay down manufacturing in areas such as North East England and the West Midlands.

Many were in the process of moving home and switching kids’ schools after being offered permanent hospital posts last month. But now they face losing their new jobs after a “dreadful” error meant some candidates were given the wrong interview marks. The Royal College of Physicians said it would have to rerun the offers process. The British Medical Association said it was “appalled” to learn of the blunder, warning it had caused “extreme anxiety” for trainees. Those hit had been offered jobs in 24 different fields through ST3 Recruitment, a nationally co-ordinated system for hiring doctors. But last week the RCP discovered some candidates had been given the wrong interview marks due to an error in transferring data from one computer program to another. It meant there were a “significant number” of incorrect rankings.  In a letter to junior doctors, the RCP said: “We are deeply sorry that it has been necessary to rerun the ST3 offer process due to a mistake in this round of processing. “We have taken this approach to be fair to all candidates which can only be achieved with the real scores used.” Furious BMA chief Chaand Nagpaul said he had spoken to RCP president Prof Jane Dacre to “articulate the strength of feeling and extent of the impact that this has had”. He said: “We have heard from trainees who have, after receiving these job offers, put down deposits on homes, arranged moves or whose families had adjusted their plans. “We cannot express how unacceptable we find this situation and the impact - both emotionally and financially - it is having on junior doctors across the UK.”  The RCP said it would do its “utmost” to resolve the cases of those who had accepted offers and made “unretractable commitments” based on those offers. It added: “We set the highest standards for our work and expect to be held to them. “We have not met them here and are truly sorry. We will learn from our mistake and make any changes necessary to fix it.” The offers process will begin again on May 14. As many as 1,500 junior doctors offered posts as registrars are feared to have had their job offers withdrawn. Doctors say they have been left stressed and in limbo, and potentially out of pocket over plans to move home. Fellow doctors described juniors as being in tears.

He told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show: “They are making a big decision about where the next plant should be in Europe.  “We have a very successful one in Deeside in North Wales, but there are choices as to whether that should be located on the Continent. “Between that plant and the plant in Burnaston in Derbyshire, there are 3,500 people employed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tory mp defended calling teenage","story":"NewsTory MP defends calling a teenage girl \u0027a complete tw*t\u0027 on Twitter claiming he thought it meant \u0027twit\u0027Michael Fabricant launched the \u0027personal attack\u0027 on a 19-year-old media student\u0026nbspShareByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent15:01, 6 MAY 2018NewsDarcy May was upset by the politician\u0027s response (Image: Daily Mirror)\u0026nbspShareGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Tory MP has defended calling a teenage girl \u0027a complete tw*t\u0027 on Twitter claiming he thought the offensive term was another word for \u0027twit\u0027. Darcy Norgate, 19, said she was shocked when her local MP Michael Fabricant replied to her with the swear word for female genitalia. The row began with a tweet on Friday afternoon in which Mr Fabricant, 67, said Labour had failed to meet expectations in Thursday\u0027s local elections and it had been a disappointing day for the party. Ms Darcy replied: Not as disappointing as Burntwood since you neglected it. Mr Fabricant hit back: Says a complete tw*t who seems unaware that there is no vote this year in Burntwood!

It\u0027s is usually held on the Sunday of the Bank Holiday weekend, and according to Cambridge legend, began as all good parties do: with a dispute over a bottle of booze. The event is said to have originated from a disagreement about 80 years ago between two drinking societies who quarrelled over a bottle of stolen Pimm\u0027s.  These days, Caesarian Sunday marks the last hurrah before it\u0027s time to knuckle down for exam season.

Andy Perry, who almost died, is believed to be the first Brit to lose an entire leg from a spider bite. The 46-year-old had been working as a landscaper when he fell ill with severe back pain just 48 hours after a fencing job in Thorpe Astley, Leics. He had no idea he had been bitten on the ankle by Britain\u0027s most venomous spider until he was rushed to hospital suffering from sepsis and kidney failure.  Andy required emergency care, was placed on an IV drip and remained at Leicester Royal Infirmary for a week. Over the next few weeks the infection subsided but he was left with lymphedema - a painful and debilitating swelling of the leg, which left his skin falling off. He said the pain got so bad that he even considered chopping off his own leg with a chainsaw. After numerous appointments with specialists Andy opted for an elective amputation above his right knee, which was carried out in March. He has now been left wheelchair bound, unable to work or play with his children and needs daily treatment. Andy, of Huncote, Leics., who lives with his police officer wife Christine, 39, said: I was doing a quote for a job in 2015 and I was coming home at lunchtime to look after the kids because my wife was on shift.  But within a couple of hours I started feeling really poorly. I rang the missus to see if she could come home but she couldn\u0027t and the next I know I got a massive ache in the small of my back. That was pretty much me done then and Christine came back home when I called her again. I went to bed when she got back, pretty much for the whole weekend and I was throwing up. Then on the Sunday morning it was a question of having to get over to the hospital as soon as I could. I was seen by a doctor in the Royal Leicester Infirmary Triage and he said there was no chance of me going home.  Then he admitted me straight away, the ache in my back was the kidney\u0027s packing up from the infection and sepsis. I put on a IV anti-biotic and almost died because of the sepsis. Experts believed the false widow spider was to blame after daily blood test when a phlebotomist noticed two puncture marks on Andy\u0027s ankle. The doctor in charge deemed the bite to be from the false widow spider - as its bite has similar effects that Andy was experiencing. Andy added: It was the phlebotomist who did my daily blood test - he spotted these little puncture marks on my ankle. He said it looks like a spider bite, they then got the doctor in charge to have look and that\u0027s what they came to agreement on. They came to a conclusion it was a false widow spider because it has a reputation of biting people.  The puncture marks were just above the sock line because I used to wear socks and boots. The only thing we can think of is that I literally just brushed past it and its had a quick bite as I\u0027ve gone past. Apparently the bite of the false widow feels like a bee sting but I didn\u0027t feel a thing. He added: The spiders are an awful lot more common than people think. After they sorted out the kidney function, things started improving and the sepsis was beaten by the anti-biotics. I\u0027ve had the district nurses coming around for the next three months changing the dressing on my leg every day. The lymphedema caused the leg to swell to the point where the skin split and fell off. That was all just a massive open weeping sores and blisters and just generally horribleness.  At that point, Andy said, his leg was all but useless and he spent time trying to get treatment. He added: There just wasn\u0027t a surgeon nearby who wanted to touch it because of the lymphedema as it was a live infection. So without getting any treatment I just couldn\u0027t work - so I figured I would go down the route of elective amputation in a last desperate attempt to get back to work. But again trying to find a doctor or surgeon to look at the amputation was hard. Eventually I had to threaten my GP with cutting my own leg off with a blade from a chainsaw because I was getting so desperate. Out of that I tried a guy in Coventry who climbed on board straight away as soon as he saw the leg. Andy said he got a second opinion after the conversation and spoke to prosthetics specialists. His leg was amputated on March 13 this year, but he suffered a setback when he got a secondary infection, resulting in another surgery on April 27. He said: I\u0027ve now got a vacuum dressing on me which pulls all of the gulp out of the leg and takes it away.

John Kinsella, 53, was the man shot dead while walking his dog in a secluded woodland alongside the M62 in Merseyside, the Liverpool Echo reports. The gunman is thought to have been on a mountain bike when he fled the scene near the Rainhill Stoops interchange on Saturday morning. Kinsella was once arrested in Amsterdam after fleeing the UK while under investigation for a robbery at a haulage depot.  In 2008, he was convicted for that robbery and the boxer and martial arts exponent, formerly from Everton, was handed an 11-year sentence for robbery, dangerous driving and skipping bail. During his trial, Kinsella admitted he was close to the scene at the time of the raid in Grantham, Lincolnshire, but claimed he was in the area to enforce a \u0026pound100,000 debt. While in the dock, his work for Liverpool FC hero Gerrard - who last week was named new manager of Rangers - was used as an example of how he collected debts and sorted out problems.  Kinsella claimed he had been contacted by Gerrard\u0027s family after the player was being targeted by George Bromley Jnr, a man nicknamed \u0027The Psycho\u0027 and described as a “violent figure” whose father, another gangland enforcer, had been “executed”. Kinsella claimed he spoke to George Bromley and from then on Bromley left Gerrard alone. The court was later read a letter from Gerrard’s father Paul – obtained after Kinsella went to his home – in which the claims were confirmed.  Mr Gerrard said that, for two years, Bromley attempted to extort money from his son – and threatened to “maim” him – until Kinsella stepped in. Paul Gerrard, whose letter was confirmed as genuine by police, said he and his son had “total respect” for Kinsella. Kinsella, a judo and jujitsu expert, had already served a nine-year prison term when he was contacted by the Gerrards.  He received the sentence at Liverpool Crown Court in October 1991 for attempted robbery and carrying a firearm with intent to commit an offence. Kinsella is believed to have been walking his dog with a friend or family member when he was targeted in a chilling attack at 7am on Saturday. His associate was not injured. A gunman, thought to have been wearing a hi-vis jacket, is believed to have shot Kinsella in a section of woodland popular with dog walkers at around 7am.  The assassin then fled the scene on a mountain bike. Kinsella was pronounced dead and Merseyside Police launched an investigation into the attack that led to a section of an M62 slip road being blocked off. Enquiries are ongoing to identify the gunman, who is described as male, around six foot and of a slim build. A Merseyside police spokeswoman said: “He was wearing dark clothing and a hi-vis jacket and riding a mountain bike. “If you saw someone matching this description around the time or area of the incident, please get in touch.

One group of men appeared to be dressed as evil Jimmy Savile, another as a traffic cone, while others chose to wear not much at all.  The revellers were pictured on nights out as thousands hit the streets in Birmingham and Blackpool on Friday and Saturday.  Among the stag and hen parties was a juggler boldly throwing flames, as well as a variety of fancy dress outfits. Many are bound to hit towns and cities across the UK again tonight before a potentially record-breaking Bank Holiday Monday.   Temperatures could reach as high as 28C in some places making it the hottest Bank Holiday Monday since record-keeping began 40 years ago.

The Hull University student, named only as Tess, was studying in the library when she made the gruesome discovery - which prompted her to cause a bit of a racket before she captured the insect on camera. The 38-year-old nursing student quickly sent a video of the larva-like insect to her husband, Steve, who immediately went to the Kingswood store to complain to staff.  Steve was given a new fruit pot and \u0026pound10 compensation for the distress caused - however Tess raised concerns over how the bug ended up inside the packaging in the first place, Hull Daily Mail reports.   Tess said: I was having the fruit pot as a snack and I had nearly eaten of all of it. “I went to put the plastic fork in my mouth after picking up a grape and on the back of the grape was this thing. “I cannot understand how that got through. You expect it maybe when with lettuce as things might creep in and hide but for pre-packaged fruit it should have already gone through quality control. “I don’t think it was a maggot but it looks a larva of some kind. It was full of life and it wasn’t nice at all. “I think it’s appalling from Asda because it was still in date until Saturday on the box. I had already had one or two and you just don’t know whether I had already eaten one.”  Tess fears she would not have spotted the creature if she had porridge with her fruit pot, as she usually does. She said: “If I had poured the fruit into the porridge I would never have seen it. “It’s lucky that the traffic was really bad so I didn’t have time to take the porridge with me.” Tess said she plans to return to Asda as it is the supermarket she uses to buy her children’s school clothes from. However, her shock find has put her off eating fruit in any form for the foreseeable future. She added: “I don’t think I will eat fruit for a while – even anything pre-packaged. Even my friend couldn’t eat her food after seeing what we saw. “From now on I will always be checking anything that is pre-packed and ready to eat.” "},{"url":null,"title":"its appalling welcome uk worst","story":"News\u0027It\u0027s an appalling welcome to the UK\u0027: Worst train station in country revealed as “small and cramped” Gatwick AirportJust two-thirds of passengers were satisfied with it - narrowly beating Oxford and Clapham Junction to the title of worst\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByLouise Sassoon00:01, 7 MAY 2018NewsHow Gatwick Airport looks to most running for - or getting off - a plane (Image: www.alamy)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGatwick Airport has the worst railway station in England, according to an independent watchdog survey. Just 66% of passengers were satisfied with it, say figures from Transport Data. The second worst score was given for the station serving Gatwick Airport (66%), followed by Oxford (67%) and Clapham Junction (69%). Also among the bottom 10 were London Victoria (72%), Hull (73%) and Cardiff Central (75%). The top four stations have all undergone major refurbishments in recent years - London King\u0027s Cross (96%), London St Pancras (95%), Birmingham New Street (92%) and Reading (92%). Independent watchdog Transport Focus surveyed more than 28,000 passengers, with 56 stations where at least 100 people responded included in the ranking.  The survey was conducted between September and November last year, shortly after a \u0026pound100 million modernisation project began at Glasgow Queen Street. Nine months into the work, some passengers are still unhappy with the station\u0027s condition. Cameron MacIntosh, 32, a sales adviser from Stirling, said: The station is an absolute bomb site at the moment. It really looks like a place from the third world. I try and avoid it. John McInnes, a 46-year-old technician from Cumbernauld, commented: I hope they are going to finish it because it looks a disaster just now. It\u0027s embarrassing bringing friends or relations here. They can\u0027t believe the mess of the place.  Receptionist Margaret McGinley, 36, from Larbert, said: It will look bad for a while, but I think it\u0027ll be amazing when they\u0027ve completed the renovation work. The Abellio ScotRail-operated station was used by 15 million passengers in 2016/17, making it Scotland\u0027s third busiest station. One Gatwick Airport passenger who responded to the survey reported that the West Sussex station is small and cramped with long queues for tickets and overcrowding on platforms. Another described it as an appalling welcome to the UK. Other critical respondents include one who claimed London Victoria is grubby for what should be a flagship station, and another who bemoaned the platforms at Cardiff Central for being very run down. Transport Focus chief executive Anthony Smith said: While Glasgow Queen Street is being redeveloped it\u0027s vital that the ScotRail Alliance continues to talk to passengers about the improvements and makes sure staff are on hand to help. Investment in stations can improve passengers\u0027 satisfaction when targeted at features which make a difference to their experience. Passengers\u0027 top priorities for stations include arrival time information, waiting rooms and the overall look and feel of the station. A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the rail industry, said: As part of the partnership railway\u0027s long-term plan, and to deliver on our commitment to boost local communities, we\u0027re investing to improve 178 small and medium-sized stations right across the country.

The heatwave is no fun for anyone, but there are a few things you can do to at least cool down your home. There\u0027s nothing worse than trying to nod off in your room, or trying to relax, while feeling like you\u0027re in the seventh circle of hell. Being in the midst of a heatwave is not as fun as it first sounds, especially without air con, but there are some things you can do to cool down your home and finally get some shut eye. Before we get to how to use a freezer to your advantage (not sticking your head in it) and getting as low as you can (no this isn\u0027t limbo), we have to acknowledge the quickest way is to get air con. Of course, the bad thing about getting air con is the cost - upfront and then running it - so here are a few quick tips and tricks to drop your home\u0027s temperature without spending too much.  Keep away from the satin and silk and opt for the cooler linen and cotton sheets. Light-coloured bed linen made of light fabrics (take Egyptian cotton for example) are breathable so better to sleep in. The Egyptians had it right, in fact, they even had their own method for keeping cool. Known as The Egyptian Method (original, we know) they\u0027d dampen a towel or sheet in cool water and use it as a blanket. It may be a good idea to lay the damp sheet on top of a towel first, no one likes a wet bed. 2. Freezer tricks Speaking of sheets, you can stick them in the freezer for a few minutes before you\u0027re about to go to sleep. No, we haven\u0027t lost our minds, just make sure you put them in something like a plastic bag before you pop them in. You don\u0027t want your sheets smelling of pizza and ice cream. The trick won\u0027t last all night but it will give you a breather so you can get to sleep. 3. Don\u0027t cook a roast  ...or any hot meal. Summer is never the time to be whipping up a casserole or hot meal. Put the slow cooker away, step away from the stove and have a salad. 4. Use that hot water bottle Buy yourself a hot water bottle. While we\u0027re used to filling them with hot water in the winter to keep toasty, in the summer sticking it in the freezer instead creates a lovely ice pack. 5. Turn your fan around Fans are great in the mild heat, but when it\u0027s cranked up they just blow hot air around so it\u0027s all about strategic placement. If you point them outside, slightly towards the windows, they push out the hot air. If you have a ceiling fan set them counter-clockwise to pull the hot air away. 6. Ice fan  We\u0027ve already mentioned fans, but there\u0027s so much more to be said. At school we used to use those little iceboxes to keep our food cool, so this idea comes from that. It\u0027s sort of a DIY aircon system. Use a roasting pan, or box and fill it with ice and put it in front of a fan. When the ice melts the breeze from the fan picks up the cool air coming from the ice\u0027s surface, creating a nice cool mist. 7. Cross breeze More of the fan tricks. Strategically place numerous fans around a room. Put a fan by the window, and then another further inside the room so they both push the cooler air around the room. 8. How low can you go Hot air rises so sleeping in a room on the ground floor means you\u0027ll feel cooler. If you\u0027re in a one-storey flat you can move your sheet to the ground to make life easier. 9. Don\u0027t get steamy  We imagine you\u0027re continually hopping in the shower to cool down, just make sure the water is tepid rather than warm/hot. Steam hangs about and makes a room that much hotter. 10. No lights This should make sense. Light bulbs - even if they\u0027re environmentally friendly - give off heat, so switch them off. The sun shines for longer now anyway so keeping the lights off not only saves on your energy bill, but cuts down on the extra heat. 11. Hang a wet sheet Yes, you read that right. Hanging a wet sheet in front of an open window will help bring down the room\u0027s temperature. 12. No electronic devices  The same applies here as the lights. Unplug your phone and devices, do not charge them when you are asleep. Everything radiates heat and you don\u0027t need that when you\u0027re trying to catch some zzzs. 13. Use grains Buckwheat pillows don\u0027t absorb heat like cotton does so getting one is a good investment for summer. 14. Closing curtains  In the daytime. If you think about when the sun is at its hottest those rays are coming through the window hotting everything up. Close the curtains and your room is instantly cooler.  15. Use your garden  If you plant the right trees and shrubs around the house they will provide you with much needed shade. Vines work well too. Of course that won\u0027t work for this summer, but next year you\u0027ll be thanking us. 16. Paint it white  Again, maybe one for next year, but painting your house white helps. The white colour reflects the light, cooling the house down. 17. Insulate  Long-term thinking again. When you think of insulation you probably think of keeping warm, but it can work the other way too. Good insulation keeps the heat out as well once the room is cooled down.

Her tennis star sons Andy and Jamie attended the primary school when a gunman killed 16 pupils and a teacher. Judy, 58, said she had hoped other shootings in the States would prompt changes to gun control laws there. But in February, 17 children were shot dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School near Miami, Florida. Judy said: “[I cried] when I heard about the most recent school shooting.” Addressing the US President, she went on: “Learn from what happened in Dun\u0026shy\u0026shyblane. Our Government acted and there hasn’t been an incident like it since. “In America, shootings happen on a regular basis. Trump could flick the switch and change all that.”  Her call came as Dunblane survivor Aimie Adam, 27, said she wants to meet the US leader when he visits the UK later this year, to question him about gun laws. She was five when Thomas Hamilton shot her twice at the primary school, near Stirling, shattering her thigh and back. Private ownership of handguns was banned after the 1996 horror. Mental health nurse Aimie, who was left with permanent injuries from the attack, said: “I know there are people who don’t want Trump to come to Scotland, but I do want him to come.  “I want to meet him, and hopefully I can twist his arm by letting him know what it is like to have your life devastated by gun violence. “I would also tell him there is something that you can do about it. We changed gun laws after Dunblane and we have never had another school shooting.” Judy’s sons were in the school when Hamilton, who the family knew, killed pupils and teacher Gwen Mayor, before turning the gun on himself.

Kate Middleton and Prince William have gone the traditional route with George, Charlotte and more recently, Louis. But other families are prepared to try something a bit different.  The Daily Record has reported on three Scottish families who found inspiration in some rather unusual places.   Ransom Morrow   The parents of Ransom Morrow hope his life won’t be as wild as the cowboy he’s named after. Lydia, 22, and illustrator Dave, 31, called their six-month-old son after Jimmy Stewart’s character in the Western The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. The couple, who live in Glasgow, say their little boy has been holding their hearts to ransom since he arrived on October 4 last year.  Lydia, who was born in Indiana, US, said: “A couple of years ago, we were talking about baby names while watching a Western. Jimmy Stewart’s character was called Ransom and we both agreed it was a great name. “When we found out I was pregnant, we started discussing names but couldn’t agree on a single one. The only one we both liked was Ransom so it stuck. “People think it’s unusual but he suits it and we can’t imagine him being called anything else.” Lydia, who has just graduated from Glasgow School of Art, added: “We are quite a creative family. Dave is an animator and illustrator and I’m hoping to do something in textile design so it makes sense that we were creative when it came to naming our baby.”  Amazon   When parents Anneliese Pirt and Andy Harris were searching for a name for their little boy, they wanted something unique. So they turned to their family tree for inspiration and called their son after the world’s most famous rainforest – and not, as some have suggested, the online retailer. And at just six months old, Amazon Atlas Spruce Harris is already living up to his globe-trotting name. The Edinburgh-born tot has visited Denmark, Switzerland, Australia and Fiji.  Primary school teacher Anneliese, 36, said: “We get a lot of people asking us if he is named after Amazon – but we just politely smile and say no.  “We wanted him to have a name that was unusual and special to us. Amazon really suits him and he already has the personality to match.” Anneliese says she and husband Andy, 41, a safety expert, chose the name Amazon to honour her relative Richard Spruce, a 19th-century botanist who spent 15 years exploring the river. She said: “Richard is famous in the world of botany. He was a great Victorian explorer and travelled down the Amazon.  “I’ve done research into him and discovered there is even a statue in his honour in Banos, Ecuador, which I have visited. “My grandad researched our family tree to find out my exact connection to Richard and he was probably my great-great uncle. Spruce is my mum’s maiden name. Andy and I had a great trip to South America, going down the Amazon following in my ancestor’s footsteps from Peru through Colombia to Brazil.  “We both fell in love with the idea of calling our baby Amazon and decided it was a good unisex name that would work whether we had a boy or a girl.”   The couple also set their hearts on the name Atlas as a middle name for their son, who was born at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh last October. Anneliese, who was born in Edinburgh, added: “Andy and I both have a love of travelling. “We actually met abroad. So Atlas reflects our love of travel, our hopes Amazon will enjoy travelling too and that he will know his way in life.  “We are now living in Fiji. Travelling is in Amazon’s genes – it’s the perfect name .”   Ultra-Violet  "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather roast russia makes","story":"NewsUK Weather: The \u0027Roast from Russia\u0027 makes British Bank Holiday hotter than Hawaii but thunderstorms are comingTemperatures could hit 29C (84.2F) as many round off the three-day weekend in 15 hours of sunrise-to-sunset “unbroken sunshine” - but the rain will be here by the end of the week\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByBen RossingtonNews reporter04:17, 7 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIf you thought Sizzling Sunday was a scorcher, stand by for today’s May Day Bank Holiday meltdown After basking in a weekend of sunshine, it could be the hottest early May bank holiday Monday since records began and will see the mercury top even that of Mexico. Temperatures could hit 29C (84.2F) as people round off the three-day weekend in 15 hours of sunrise-to-sunset “unbroken sunshine” for many, the Met Office said. That will see Britain hotter than both 23C Mexico City and 26C Honolulu, Hawaii. But sunlovers are already being warned to make the most of it, with rain and thunderstorms on their way by the end of the week.  Dubbed the Roast From Russia, the hot air is arriving from 30C southern Russia and is banishing memories of the freezing Beast from the East which struck in late February. The South East, East Anglia and the East Midlands will feel the effect of the hot spell the most, the Met Office confirmed. Scotland and Northern Ireland will be a little cooler but eastern parts of Scotland will reach the low 20s. Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna said: “It will certainly be the warmest early May Bank Holiday on record, with 29C possible in the South-East.  “There will be plenty of sunshine for most, with good conditions for outdoor activities. “On Tuesday, 28C is possible again and it will be in the low 20s from Wednesday and a lot of fine weather in days ahead, with only the chance of a shower on Tuesday and Thursday.”  Although things are likely to worsen by next weekend, the outlook for the summer is good. The Met Office three-month forecast, being briefed to councils, transport chiefs and business leaders, said: “For May-July, above-average temperatures are more probable than below-average temperatures. “The probability the UK average temperature for May-July will fall into the warmest of our five categories is 30 per cent. The probability of the coldest of our five categories is between 5 and 10 per cent.” The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “This summer could be the warmest for five years.  “31C could be seen from June onwards. Warm air is due from continental Europe. “As recent summers have been so mixed, this summer has a higher chance of being the warmest since 2013. But there will also be cool and wet spells.” Today’s sunshine is likely to signal another stampede to the beaches, which were full yesterday. Around 125,000 visitors are expected to hit Brighton, 50,000 at Bournemouth and another possible 50,000 at Blackpool today.

Most Brits are so baffled by washing instruction labels that thousands of pounds worth of garments are ruined. Fewer than one in seven of us can correctly identify the six most common washing symbols. As a result one in three simply sling clothes in the machine without checking labels. Most of us admit to having accidentally washed items that are dry clean only. Men tend to be more careless, with 78% always using the same washing programme. But almost half of women use just three programmes or fewer. Yet these are not the only startling stats to come out in the wash in school uniform supplier Trutex’s survey.  Care for our clothes after they are taken out the machine also leaves a lot to be desired. Some nine in 10 people did not know some items should never go into a tumble dryer. And six out of 10 do not check the setting needed for ironing. Nearly all women learned how to wash clothes as young girls by helping their mums and know about separating whites from colours. In contrast, just 15% of men assisted their mothers. About 70% did not use a washing machine until they left home and that tended to be at a laundrette.  One in six men have never used one. Matthew Easter, managing director at Trutex said knowledge of labels can save time and money. He said: “This is especially important when it comes to school uniforms which are worn five days a week and often treated very roughly and require frequent cleaning.”   ANSWERS:  1 Hand wash. 2 Machine wash. 3 Water temperature not above 30C 4 Machine wash (permanent press). 5 Machine wash (gentle cycle). 6 Do not wash. 7 Do not bleach 8 Tumble dry. 9 Do not iron. 10 Do not wring.

Baggy flares, massive statement belts, stripy highlights, those skirt-trouser things, inflatable everything, bubble writing - there was a lot going on.  Happily, apart from the odd rogue trend which has since resurfaced, many of these have stayed in the noughties and quietly died the death they so richly deserve.  But one fashion statement is set to make a comeback and, call us nostalgic, we\u0027re actually really excited. Remember Groovy Chick? If you\u0027re of a certain age, then you definitely will.  Groovy Chick didn\u0027t really do anything other than adorn Bang On The Door merchandise - of which there was a lot (stationary, bedding, clothing, you name it) but that wasn\u0027t the point, Because in doing so, she became a sort of fashion phenonmenon. There were other Bang on the Door characters too Fairy Girl, Beach Babe - but Groovy Chick was the Big Dog. Now, thanks to Primark, she is set to rule again - 30 years after she was initially designed by Karen Duncan and Samantha Stringle.

Incredible footage shows the moment a succession of people leapt to the rescue of the child after he fell into a ditch in Jiangshan, China. A family of three who happened to be passing at the moment the boy found himself in trouble were helped by others as they eventually pulled him to safety. The child was dragged 150 metres by surging rain water before he was recovered.  Xu Weihua had been driving past when he realised the boy was in serious trouble. I had just turned my car around when I saw a boy in the sewer and the water was up to his chest. He was desperately holding on to the cement overhang. I then cried out, \u0027Hurry, hurry! Go get him! He\u0027ll be gone in seconds. Xu\u0027s parents, who were also in the car, leapt out and began running alongside the ditch, trying to catch the boy before he was swept away. However, the 11-year-old was carried into the covered section before they could reach him. But the couple refused to give up and kept chasing along the ditch while Xu dashed to the next uncovered section crying for help.

Kim Jong-un promised to denuclearise the Korean peninsula last month during a landmark summit with South Korea\u0027s President Moon Jae-in. It\u0027s the first time a North Korean leader has stepped foot in the south since the end of the Korean War in 1953. The pledge boosted hopes of peace amid fears over North Korea\u0027s nuclear missile programme and even prompted Republicans to suggest Donald Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize for his role, despite months of online threats. But North Korea has now accused the US of misleading public opinion over the diplomatic breakthrough, which it was claimed was aided by a series of UN and US sanctions designed to halt the development of nuclear weapons.  The state\u0027s official news agency KCNA reported that North Korea also warned the US not to deliberately provoke Kim Jong-un by moving to deploy strategic assets in South Korea and raising human rights issues. This act cannot be construed otherwise than a dangerous attempt to ruin the hardly-won atmosphere of dialogue and bring the situation back to square one, the a foreign ministry spokesman was quoted as saying. It would not be conducive to resolving the issue of denuclearisation if Washington miscalculated North Korea\u0027s peace-loving intention as a sign of weakness and continued to pursue its pressure and military threats, KCNA said. Trump, who plans to meet Kim over the next few weeks, has said he will maintain sanctions and pressure on the North and not repeat the mistakes of past administrations.  He claimed his tough stance had helped create the breakthrough. Trump told the National Rifle Association\u0027s annual convention in Dallas on Friday that he had toned down his rhetoric in anticipation of the talks after labelling Kim Little Rocket Man last year and threatening him with fire and fury.  Moon said Trump deserved a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end the standoff with the North, while 18 House Republicans also backed him to be awarded the honour.  The White House said that Trump\u0027s national security adviser, John Bolton, met his South Korean counterpart, Chung Eui-yong, on Friday and both said there were no plans to change the U.S.-South Korea bilateral defence posture. North and South Korea are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. South Korea said US troops need to stay in the area even after a peace treaty is concluded to replace the armistice. The United States stations 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the war. "}]
