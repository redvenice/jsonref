But the former diplomat ensured the talks were ‘friendly and constructive’.         The Prince felt forced to go public – in defiance of the Queen – to get his family to take his threat to walk away seriouslyHarry was presented with options and alternatives. Then, having been finally been given a clearer direction of what was wanted without the need to patch in Meghan by phone from Canada, the four were tasked with making the Prince’s wishes work, and fast. The offer on Frogmore helped the negotiations advance, and over five frantic days, the various incarnations of the deal were circulated in paper form and via encrypted email back and forth, with the HRH titles understood to be particular sticking point.The private secretaries and aides gathered yesterday morning at Buckingham Palace hopeful that Friday’s promise of an ‘imminent breakthrough’ could finally become a reality. By lunchtime, it was clear enough kinks had been ironed out of the ‘Megxit’ deal to go public.The Queen was alerted at Sandringham and a final draft of statements were circulated for remote sign off as far as Charles’s seat in Birkhall, Scotland.However some awkward issues around whether Harry will revoke his British residency, where he will pay tax and whether the pair will be allowed to continue using the Sussex Royal website have been kicked into the long grass.         There has been a growing row about who will pick up Harry and Meghan\u0027s annual security bill as they split their time between the UK and Canada (the couple are pictured last week)Courtiers insist that the pair will always be members of the Royal Family, but the use of the ‘royal’ moniker in a solely commercial enterprise is likely to become a running sore. The headache of who will pay for the pair’s security also remains answered.But it was decided these awkward details could be ironed out during a ‘transition period’ of the next few months into the spring – the start of the new tax year.Each private secretary spoke to their boss, and finally got the nod on Saturday afternoon, as spin doctors prepared to send the news around the world. A statement in the name of Her Majesty the Queen is a rarity, so to have two issued in a week shows just how devastating the impact of Megxit has been to her familyBut it was last night’s statement that revealed how long this saga has really rumbled on when it stated: ‘Following many months of conversations and more recent discussions’. Even ‘months’ may be an understatement, with the strain becoming evident even before Meghan and Harry walked down the aisle.In November 2016, Harry blasted the media’s coverage of his new girlfriend, and particularly ‘the racial undertones of comment pieces and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments’. And over the years there were hints about Harry’s discomfort about being a member of the royal family.It had been hoped that giving the Sussexes’ their own Royal Household last year would give Harry and Meghan the freedom that they wanted.But their plans to establish their own independent ‘court’ at Windsor was thwarted by the Queen and Prince Charles who jointly agreed that the household should remain under the auspices of Buckingham Palace.The couple have also faced public criticism, such as the news in April last year that £2.4 million of taxpayers’ money had been spent renovating Frogmore.Then a group of Meghan’s closest friends gave anonymous interviews to People magazine in the US alleging that the negative publicity had put the pregnant Duchess ‘under a level of emotional trauma’ and suggesting she had had to endure ‘lies and untruths being written about her.’In an ITV documentary last October, filmed during a visit to Africa, she revealed that she had tried to adopt the ‘stiff upper lip’, saying: ‘Not many people have asked if I’m OK’ in an apparent swipe at her royal relatives.And Harry spoke about the rift with his brother, saying that he and William were ‘certainly on different paths at the moment’ while insisting that: ‘We’re brothers, we’ll always be brothers. I love him dearly’.Yesterday’s deal caps 20 months of bitterness, with Palace insiders hoping this move will actually bring the brothers back together.Indeed the pair could come face to face tomorrow as Harry is expected to take part in one final Royal duty before joining his wife and son in Canada, The Mail on Sunday has learnt, at the UK Africa Investment Summit.However there is anger that Meghan will not be joining him as planned as part of the major drive for post-Brexit trade championed by three Government departments.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will host a reception at Buckingham Palace on behalf of the Queen, and it is understood that the Duke of Sussex will take part in a private event during the summit.A Government source said: ‘Harry and Meghan were meant to be the star turn but obviously that has gone down the pan.’With a transition period to ease them out of public life, there will be plenty of changes needed for the Sussexes in the coming months –starting with removing ‘their HRHs’ from the Sussex Royal website. "},{"url":null,"title":"Germany hosts Libya summit bid curb military meddling","story":"Share this article Germany\u0027s priority is to try to get the outside players that have interests in the conflict on the same page, stem the flow of weapons to Libya and ensure that the cease-fire sticks -- creating space for UN-led efforts to re-establish a political process in Libya.\u0027At the Libya conference, we must see above all that the arms embargo is once again complied with - it has been agreed in principle at UN level but unfortunately not kept to\u0027, Merkel said.Germany is also keen to prevent the fighting in Libya from further destabilizing the region, potentially setting off new waves of migrants seeking safety in Europe across the Mediterranean Sea.

Eisenstaedt was experimenting with a new Leica camera that allowed him to do away with much of the clunky paraphernalia of his craft. That night, at the gala premiere of Rimsky-Korsakov’s The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh, he was looking for a way to find some intimacy among the theatre’s grand architectural curves.Scanning the boxes in the upper tiers of the opera house he saw a young woman whose attention to the progress of the Russian epic on stage did not seem absolute. Better still, the box next to her was empty. Eisenstaedt was an unobtrusive man, only 5ft, and he inveigled his way into the empty box and got his shot. “Without the girl there would have been no picture,” he said.A couple of years later, this was one of the images that persuaded a new magazine called Life, in New York, to take on the German-born Eisenstaedt as one of its first four staff photographers. Having photographed Hitler and Goebbels (the latter scowled into Eisenstaedt’s lens on discovering he was a Jew) he had left Berlin for the US in 1935. Among the 2,500 photo stories he published in Life in the next four decades was perhaps the most iconic image of the end of war: a US sailor kissing a young nurse in Times Square on VJ Day.Eisenstaedt died in 1995, aged 96. His La Scala picture is included in a new exhibition devoted to modernism in photography since the first world war. Eisenstaedt was the least austere of modernists. “People don’t take me too seriously with my little camera,” he once suggested. “I don’t come as a photographer.

I was a child of the 1980s and a teenager in the 90s: my formative years were during something like the most inidualistic age in history. While I learned times tables at primary school, Margaret Thatcher was telling the nation there was no such thing as society. During my teenage years, product advertising and globalisation brought a new age of hyper-consumerism, as we were bombarded with education programmes to build self-esteem and TV shows such as Big Brother, The X Factor and The Apprentice, which all glorified self-aggrandisement in subtly different ways.Developing human minds are like sponges and ours were submerged in ever more inidualistic language. Phrases such as “unique”, “personal”, “self”, “me” and “mine” were used with increasing frequency in lyrics, TV shows and books. This immersion took its toll: analysis of data from almost 80 countries  shows how the majority have shown marked increases in inidualistic attitudes over recent decades.Having a strong sense of self can be useful, but excessive inidualism has its costs. The more we see ourselves as discrete entities, the more likely we are to feel isolated and lonely and to show “selfish” behaviours. As a consequence, rates of anxiety and depression are rising across the world, while the climate and bioersity crises deepen ever further.Yet times are changing. In the last decade, we may have seen inidualism peak. Scientific discoveries have revealed how the perception of a distinct self is an illusion. Our bodies are made from materials that were once parts of countless other organisms, from ancient plants to dinosaurs. Most of our 37tn cells are directed by a genetic code that is a shared heritage not just of humanity but all of life on Earth. You might think your life experiences define you, but the neural networks in your brain that encode these are changing constantly – you are not even the same person you were when you started reading this article. And the new science of social networks shows how we are linked together so closely that ideas, behaviours and preferences flow between us in a way that makes it unclear where one mind ends and another begins.And people are finding new value in being part of groups, whether it is through activism (Extinction Rebellion, youth strikes, political party memberships) or leisure activities (book clubs, festivals, park runs). New research shows that when people have a broader sense of group identity (for example viewing themselves as global citizens, rather than embracing nationalism), they tend to be more likely to engage in pro-environmental behaviours, such as reducing their carbon emissions, buying sustainably and volunteering. A new age of collectivism seems to be dawning – and not a moment too soon.So what can be done to make people truly embrace being part of a group? In answering this question, it is worth bearing in mind that the evolutionary history of our brains means we are susceptible to certain biases. When populations face shocks such as environmental catastrophe or social unrest, they are more likely to strengthen bonds between their “in-group” members, while caring less about those outside of the group. This is a defence mechanism to help groups pull together and overcome hardship. Social research has shown that it operates at the country level, too – countries facing crises are more likely to show prejudice towards outsiders and elect authoritarian leaders. Environmental catastrophes are only expected to worsen under climate change, which means nationalism could grow purely due to this evolutionary bias. Yet, is this a sensible response?In 2020, we live in a highly globalised world, with cross-border flows of money and people, as well as environmental impacts such as the climate crisis and air pollution. If we bond together within nations but with less regard for the welfare of others beyond those borders, we will end up fouling the global commons, ultimately to our own detriment.Yet there is hope. New research shows how we can escape inidualism. Outdoor community activities increase both our psychological connectedness to others and to the natural world. Escape cities to go for a walk with family or friends, or volunteer in a garden or park near you as often as you can. Meditation is proven to alter neural networks in the brain and reduce self-centredness, and solitary activities such as reading and playing computer games have been shown to increase empathy with others. We can all do something small to be part of something bigger and help solve our global problems. Let’s all get on with it.• Tom Oliver is professor of ecology at the University of Reading, and author of The Self Delusion, which will be published on 23 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a73118c4e1bd5de132c860f46f38f774a6ab79a/287_0_3241_1945/master/3241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88b07708c6324d9b10850c278004be43","title":"a pushkin theme park how about discworld world stephenkingland ","story":"After many children’s book attractions, an ‘immersive experience’ based on the poet’s fairytales is planned in Russia. Isn’t it time for more adult resorts?There are lovers of fairytales and lovers of Russian literature and lovers of theme parks, and sometimes, just sometimes, everyone’s wishes can be met in one place. News arrives that a new Russian theme park inspired by the poetic fairytales of Alexander Pushkin is due to open in St Petersburg in 2023, built around the imaginary land of Lukomorye described in Pushkin’s poem Ruslan and Ludmila.Lukomorye will, promise its designers, be “a magical place where one can step into the fairytales of Pushkin in a modern, immersive and spectacular way, yet with the typical flair of Russian folklore and tradition”, and will contain “experiences and attractions” based on the city, the harbour and palace that Pushkin describes in his stories. There will also be a funfair market, a swan lake, a fairytale forest, an “immersive walk-through experience based on Pushkin’s life”, and two “spectacular dark rides”.I for one am in. This goes straight to the top end of my literary theme-parks wish list, overtaking my desire to visit the still-in-the-planning Harper Lee Trail (Lee herself would surely have hated this, and I can’t imagine it being very jolly) and the Wizarding World of Harry Potter (I’d love to, but I can’t afford it).It doesn’t, however, trump my longing to go to Astrid Lindgren World in Sweden – where you can wander Villekulla Cottage, the farm Katthult and Matt’s Forest – or to Moominworld in Finland, where there’s a “wild snow sliding hill”, “interactive magic seashells” (no, I don’t know either, but yes please), and Snork’s Park of Inventions. As Moominmamma says: “All fun is good for the stomach.” It sounds wonderful.As the parent of a three-year-old who recently visited the surprisingly not-awful Peppa Pig World, an experience that convinced said three-year-old that there is a theme park out there for every eventuality. Now I spend many an evening working on plans for Robin Hood World with him. It’s exhausting, but I like his style. If we can have Pushkinlandia, then what else can we hope for? Discworld World? A Stephen King-themed park, hopefully in Derry, Maine? Looking into this, I discovered the delightful fact that Universal Studios Florida did once plan “an elaborate dark ride” themed on the master.“Part-way through, riders would pull into the unload station and hear the usual instructions on how to exit without extensive bodily injury. But the restraints wouldn’t lift and the ride wasn’t over. A Shining-sized deluge of blood would flood out of the exit doors, Pennywise Itself would spring from the control room and riders would hurtle deeper into the nightmaretoward the gift shop,” reveals the Bloody Disgusting website.Sadly, it wasn’t to be: “The powers that be decided that an attraction requiring a plumbing system for fake blood might not have the wide appeal they wanted, so Men in Black: Alien Attack was finally built in its place.” A crying shame."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/648df4f8cd170bea1b5162fd87656cb775ead462/0_290_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=465d9c43dfee94ac2d49362cbb772247","title":"uk brewers invest in low alcohol drinks trend","story":"The UK drinks industry has embarked on a detox that extends beyond January with companies racing to bring out “nolo” (no- or low-alcohol) beers, spirits and cocktails to satisfy a thirst for hangover-free drinking.With an estimated 4.2 millionUK consumers trying to stick to a “dry January” pledge, the British Beer \u0026amp Pub Association (BBPA), estimates that nearly 5m pints of low and no-alcohol beer will be bought this month. But for many people, abstaining from booze is already a lifestyle choice with more than one in five adults teetotal, according to official figures, with young adults leading the way.The world’s biggest brewers and drinks makers have been quick to spot the opportunity. Johnnie Walker owner Diageo has non-alcoholic spirit Seedlip while Budweiser owner Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken have launched dozens of low- and non-alcoholic beers. Smaller-scale and craft brewers are also trying to carve out a role Brewdog has enjoyed success with its low-alcohol Nanny State pale ale, while London-based, alcohol-free craft brewer Big Drop is also enjoying bumper growth with a range of beers that includes lager, pale ale and IPA.To keep up with demand, Big Drop will next month launch a £1m crowdfunding campaign as it looks to increase its presence in UK pubs. “The goal is to make sure Big Drop is on tap right next to your favourite craft beer. We want people to be as confident ordering Big Drop as any full-strength beer,” said its co-founder Rob Fink, a former City lawyer who started the company with his friend James Kindred.Although drinkers were inundated with new no- and low-alcohol beers, wines, spirits and cocktails last year, CGA analyst Charlie Mitchell expects the trend to continue in 2020 as opting out of alcohol moves into the mainstream. Its research found that one in three adults had tried one in the previous six months.“With even more people likely to cut back on booze after the Christmas excesses, producers, operators and suppliers are queueing up to jump on the opportunity with an ever-increasing range of no- and low-alcohol alternatives,” he explains. “With many consumers eager to trial them out of curiosity, the challenge will be to build loyalty in a market where it is increasingly hard to stand out.”In common with Scottish brewer Brewdog, which rewarded small investors with perks, Big Drop – which does not own its own brewery – is offering investors extras such as festival tickets and discounts to encourage them to part with their cash, with £50 the smallest stake.“We started this company because our own lifestyles had changed,” explained Fink who wants to do for alcohol-free beer what the “craft beer revolution has done for beer”. “James and I had recently become fathers and the lower-alcohol beer we wanted just wasn’t there. We knew there were a lot of people who felt exactly the same way as we did.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d29d2a4b1646cec982f068478f7197387cf08b5a/136_0_3364_2018/master/3364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f40b5cad5337886fc993471a43a7eb82","title":"uk house prices rise at fastest rate on record","story":"2019 general election result provided period of ‘stability’ following Brexit uncertainty UK house prices rose over the last month at the fastest rate on record for the time of the year, as sellers felt more confident about the outlook for the housing market after the general election, according to Rightmove.Miles Shipside, a director at Rightmove said the election result had provided a “window of stability” for potential movers after a period of instability since the Brexit vote, which had caused some to put off a move.He said: “The housing market dislikes uncertainty, and the unsettled political outlook over the last three and a half years since the EU referendum caused some potential home movers to hesitate.

This year’s theme is how do we “create a more cohesive and sustainable world”.Blogs include a discussion of whether, as businesses are thriving while societies aren’t, this is the end of an era for shareholder capitalism “financing fossil fuels risks a repeat of the 2008 crash” and “The route to true gender equality? Fix the system, not women”.Trading volumes are thin as US markets will be closed for Martin Luther King Day. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says:Falling sales in the UK will inevitably spark fears the gin boom has turned to bust, while guidance for weaker sales in the US and lower margins undermine Fevertree’s long term pitch that it can replicate its success across the pond. The European stock markets have opened.And the world’s 22 richest men are wealthier than all the women in Africa combined, says Oxfam.The climate crisis will loom large over Davos, and Mark Carney, who becomes the new UN special envoy for climate change and finance once his term as governor of the Bank of England ends in mid-March, will be attending. He will also be the UK’s key adviser for the next UN climate change conference in Glasgow in November (COP26).

Alongside this, “domestic political polarisation” and “extreme heat waves” were flagged as top threats.

The weekend’s report that the House of Lords might be moving, lock, stock and barrel, to York is radical, exciting and sensible. If this is the new Boris Johnson, all hail the chief. It is precisely the talisman needed of a government that has had enough of the southwards drift. Such ideas are often mooted but always crushed by a reactionary Westminster. The only doubt must be whether the Johnson-Cummings coalition has the guts and staying power to push it through.Britain now regularly bottoms Europe’s league table in the disparity between its capital and its provinces, in everything from wealth and health to productivity and investment. The London magnet is awesome and relentless. Every infrastructure decision, from HS2 to Crossrail to research centres to museums, is aimed at London. This will not be reversed until those who take decisions view the nation from outside the capital. They have to get out of town.Moving the House of Lords would be largely symbolic, since the house is itself largely symbolic. It should stop being a mix of worthy veterans and party hacks and a place where seats can be bought along with the right to collect £300 a day. Johnson’s reported idea of making it a chamber of the regions is excellent. That was how parliament functioned in the Middle Ages – and it worked. It staved off revolutions.As for the Commons, reform is no less urgent. MPs must shortly face a decision to vacate the Palace of Westminster. Parliament is not going to matter much over the next five Johnsonian years and the institution is badly in need of a detox. The building is already a disgrace, despite the huge sums of money continually being spent on it. The place is so rotten Big Ben cannot even be made to ring for under half a million pounds.Current proposals for the temporary evacuation of the palace read like something from a Ministry of Defence aircraft carrier spec. Every excuse has been dreamed up to increase cost – MPs’ health and safety, national security, respect for tradition, staff facilities, swimming pools and gyms. Members want the taxpayer to build an extravagant replica House of Commons by demolishing a starred listed building off Whitehall behind Richmond Terrace. No other organisation in the land would be allowed to do this.In its place MPs want to erect a Disneyland Commons chamber with up to half a billion pounds of public money – all just for four years of use. This is chiefly because they have insisted on keeping replica ision lobbies and not doing what every other country’s assembly does, which is vote electronically. They cannot bring themselves even to save money by experimenting with a semicircular chamber, for fear it might reduce the shouting idiocies of prime minister’s questions. All this is ruled by the speaker, the leader and a commission of mysterious MPs. This is how Britain, or at least Westminster, is run. It will make the MPs’ expenses spent on moats and duck islands look like small beer.The answer has to be to get the hell out of the village, to escape the bubble, go on tour. Nothing would bring a more refreshing change of air to British politics after the past three years than for everyone to leave Westminster. There are debating chambers waiting the length and breadth of the land, from Manchester to Edinburgh, Cardiff to Winchester, Bristol to Newcastle.Since the Commons chamber is rarely full beyond Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the inconvenience would hardly be great – less so for provincial members. MPs can keep their London offices. As for the media, another England – another Britain – would emerge from the shadows and come to life. Every issue would look different, every priority shift, every budget subtly adjust.As for the lords, permanent residence in York would sort the wheat from the piffle and wind. If it is to be more than a distinguished old persons’ club, it will have to play a role that challenges the Commons. It must be a true champion of the provinces. It could argue for the rerouting of the benighted HS2 up the east coast. It could demand such vanity projects be concentrated in the north.The mooted site for the new chamber, in a goods yard outside York station, is ideal. It is currently occupied by a museum crammed to bursting with exhausted steam engines."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15bb8a892002f74512966533f7c91ef0016425dd/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8dcfbabc341660c55e0a45f97f79be84","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of dry","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘dry’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘dry’.Share your photos of what dry means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 22 January at 10am.

Staff on short-term contracts said they felt unable to defend themselves against the demands of managers or permanent colleagues.Jo Grady, the UCU general secretary, said students would be shocked by the levels of dehumanisation of staff at universities where they were studying.“We need to have an honest conversation about casualisation that draws out the real extent of the problem and how we can secure improvements for staff. The Office for Students should demand that universities disclose the extent of teaching – measured in classroom hours – that is being done by casualised staff,” Grady said.The report explores data showing that 67,000 research staff were on fixed-term contracts, making up two-thirds of the total research staff employed at universities, alongside 30,000 contracted teaching staff, many paid by the hour. A further 69,000 academic staff were on “atypical contracts” and so are not counted in the main staff record, while an estimated 6,500 were on zero-hours contracts.But a spokesperson for the Universities and Colleges Employers’ Association (UCEA) said its members had been reducing the number of zero-hours contracts and “atypical contracts”, while expanding the number of open-ended staff contracts.“UCEA has over recent years worked with UCU and the other higher education trade unions to better understand employment across the HE sector,” he said.“The employment arrangements within autonomous universities are of course for institutional-level discussions and not for UCEA. Universities always want to ensure their colleagues, whatever contract they are on, feel that they are appropriately rewarded and supported to give of their best for students.”The findings come in the middle of long-running industrial action over pensions and pay between UCU’s members and university employers, with further strikes across British higher education on the cards later this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49df761f0ed1a78b2d201d3a82a13066f29660df/0_40_5892_3536/master/5892.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=036b268add1d4ff074f9b6b5d9ee3003","title":"businesses named on a list for tackling their climate impact","story":"Sainsbury’s, Lego and H\u0026ampM feature on list that rewards shift to renewable energy and reducing emissionsSainsbury’s, Lego and H\u0026ampM are among the businesses to make a prestigious A-list of companies that are deemed to be at the forefront of the charge to tackle the “existential” climate crisis.The company also has an F-list for companies that did not submit a response for climate change in 2019 – with Amazon and Facebook among the 9,225.Dexter Galvin, CDP’s global director of corporations and supply chains, said the A-list were “blazing a trail for others to follow”. He said: “Other companies should look to these leaders for inspiration and learn from them.”With the financial performance of companies on the A-list better than their rivals, Galvin said this demonstrated that “leading on climate action is good business in today’s economy” and would be “essential business in tomorrow’s economy”.Unilever points to the success of its trophy sustainable brands – a group of 28 that includes Dove, Hellmann’s and Sunsilk – which are growing much faster than the rest of its business. The brands, which accounted for more than half of the group’s €51bn (£46bn) sales last year, are those that are the furthest ahead on meeting the company’s sustainability goals.A-list companies scored highly because of their transparent and comprehensive disclosure of climate data. Examples of best practice include setting science-based targets, shifting to renewable energy and incentivising suppliers to reduce their emissions.Lego, for example, was praised for increasing its use of recycled materials and plant-based plastics two years ago it started selling Lego pieces made from plant-based plastic sourced from sugar cane. Sainsbury’s, meanwhile, has pledged to halve the amount of plastic packaging it uses over the next six years.CDP says investors and purchasers are calling for transparency and action from companies on how they are responding to climate change.

If officials get their way, the city will be split into zones, and, rather than driving direct, motorists will have to use the ring road for all zone-to-zone journeys.Those travelling by foot and bicycle in the new Brum won’t be inconvenienced: their journeys will be simple and – with fewer cars – safer. With cars out of the way, bus journeys will become swifter and more reliable.The Birmingham transport plan, launched last week, was influenced by Ghent’s zone-centred traffic circulation plan of 2017. This medieval Belgian city – a quarter of the size of Birmingham – demonstrated that it was possible to switch attitudes overnight. Streets were blocked to motorists one Sunday evening and – to the disappointment of the waiting media –there was no wailing, no gnashing of teeth, no gridlock.Retailers and restaurants that had warned of Armageddon discovered that takings did not plummet.A year after the imposition of the traffic circulation plan – in news that may encourage similarly minded politicians around the world, Watteeuw was re-elected with an increased majority.Another advantage of the intervention is that it is remarkably cheap to implement Ghent’s plan cost just €4m (£3.4m) to implement. By comparison it costs an estimated £20m-£30m to build just one mile of motorway.A great deal of Ghent’s traffic congestion was found to have been caused by an excess of short car journeys – as planners had accurately modelled.“We had people complaining that a drive of 300 metres became a car journey of two kilometres,” remembers Watteeuw. “We had to explain that we don’t want people to use a car for 300 metres: they should walk.”Before the introduction of Ghent’s circulation plan, all that could be heard was the cacophony of cars, complained the resident, but “now he hears birdsong”, Watteeuw said.“Instead of car noise,” he adds, “people can now hear each other talking and children laughing.”For Mel Jones, Birmingham city council’s head of transport planning, taming cars can’t come soon enough.“Growth in Birmingham’s population will result in 1.2 million additional daily trips across our highways network by 2031,” she says. “Accommodating all these trips by private car is simply not sustainable.”Road widening is off the table, she adds. It’s expensive, unpopular – and doesn’t work.“We need to look at ways of keeping the city moving in a sustainable and efficient way,” says Jones.“Reducing pressure on kerb space” will “provide improved penetration and accessibility by public transport in the city centre,” promises the plan. “Public transport and cycling provision will be prioritised over car parking provision.”The “allocation of road space will change away from single occupancy private cars,” the council says, because the priority should be “moving people, not vehicles”.Freight deliveries will be restricted to out-of-hours, and there will be a blanket 20mph speed limit across the city’s local roads.Birmingham must “build a future in which the car will no longer be king”, says Waseem Zaffar, the city council cabinet member for transport and environment.Cars, he adds, are “bad for the health of ourselves and our families, bad for our communities and bad for business as measured by the millions of pounds of lost productivity caused by congestion”.Watteeuw advises Birmingham’s councillors not to stagger any changes.“In Ghent, we implemented the plan as a whole overnight,” he says. “It was technically and politically the easiest way.”The Birmingham transport plan goes out to public consultation soon. Watteeuw – who received death threats before the implementation of the plan – urges the residents of Birmingham not to allow loud voices and vested interests to derail the process.“Talk to people, but be persistent, and don’t give in on the plan’s principal benefits,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/501ba1c0df71839bf0778d65a287548aa8a8ecd3/76_0_1662_997/master/1662.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8ae5bb1805e4bb387b15fc4c7cd8607","title":"why was pioneering director alice guy blache erased from film making history","story":"A new documentary sheds light on the career of the forgotten Frenchwoman who helped write the rules of filmCall yourself a cinephile and you’ve never heard of Alice Guy-Blaché? Don’t worry, most film-makers haven’t heard of her either. But we all should have done. In fact, there should be statues of her and cinemas named after her. At the very least, Guy-Blaché’s name belongs in chapter one of cinema history, because she was the first female film director indeed, for a good decade she was the only female film director.Guy-Blaché was in the room when the Lumière brothers held the first ever cinema screening, in Paris in March 1895. By the following year, she was making her own films. And while the Lumières were still hung up on cinema as a technological spectacle – “Look! A train!” – Guy-Blaché immediately saw its potential for telling stories. Even her 60-second debut, The Cabbage Fairy, had a fictional narrative (a fairy conjures babies from cardboard cabbages). As time went on, Guy-Blaché helped write the rules of this brand new medium. She incorporated now-standard techniques such as editing, primitive special effects and hand-tinted colour. She might even have invented the music video, back in 1905, with her use of newfangled “chronophone” technology, by which singers were filmed lip-syncing to a prerecorded playback.Guy-Blaché began as in-house film-maker for France’s Gaumont pictures, where she seems to have done everything: producing, writing, directing, casting, set design. She then moved to the US and founded her own studio (another first), Solax. She made more than 1,000 films, including comedies, westerns and dramas, many of which put women to the fore. Her 1906 film The Consequences of Feminism imagines a world where gender roles are reversed: men sew and iron at home while the women smoke and fight. She also made possibly the first all-African-American film: 1912’s A Fool and His Money (its racial politics leave something to be desired).How could such a pioneer fade into obscurity? Film-maker Pamela B Green finds out in her new documentary Be Natural (which takes its title from a sign to actors Guy-Blaché had hanging in her studio). Inevitably, the answer has much to do with her gender. Being a woman was no impediment to Guy-Blaché’s career in France, but things got worse when she went to the US. But it is as much to do with how film history has been written by men. While her male counterparts were canonised, Guy-Blaché’s work was forgotten, neglected, even attributed to the men.Be Natural doesn’t just tell her story, it literally reconstitutes her legacy: Green scours archives, finds relatives, locates lost prints and interviews. Once it’s reassembled, you wonder how this history could ever have been forgotten. And how many others like it might still be out there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/090043262ddee5204bd080fc174d6d7a7e5089bb/0_206_7670_4605/master/7670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fdd0291bc181dd9047343724073fb2a","title":"five recipes chinese new year feast fuchsia dunlop","story":"Celebrate China’s lunar new year with classic and updated dishes, including dongpo pork, stir-fried okra and braised fish with chilliesThe ersity of Chinese cuisines is extraordinary but one food ritual unites Han Chinese communities all over the country and the world: the lunar New Year’s Eve dinner. (This year’s Chinese new year is on 25 January.) It’s the time when families traditionally gather for a lavish feast, prefaced by ritual offerings to gods and ancestors, and followed at midnight by a storm of firecrackers.There are few rules for this “family reunion” (tuannian) meal except that there should be extraordinary amounts of food, particularly fish, meat and poultry (dayu darou: “great fish and great meat”). In the countryside, many households still fatten a pig as the holiday approaches, eating the prime cuts over the festivities, then making bacon, sausages or confit pork to eke out over the months ahead. The other essential is a fish, served whole and never quite finished, because the phrase “a fish every year” (niannian youyu) sounds the same in Chinese as “every year a surplus”. When I’m cooking a Chinese new year feast at home in London, I like to borrow freely from different regional traditions, mixing some of the delicate dishes from the Jiangnan region and the Cantonese south with a bit of Sichuan and Hunan spice. What’s most important from the point of view of the cook is to avoid a menu that leans heavily on dishes that have to be prepared at the last minute. Instead, try to include a few cold dishes and slow-cooked stews that can be made ahead of time: that way, you can have fun with a bit of wok whizz-bangery and still sit down with your guests to eat.In the following selection, a sumptuous potful of dongpo pork, one of the classic dishes of Hangzhou, tastes even better when made a day in advance. The chicken for the Sichuanese bang bang chicken can also be poached beforehand, the spinach blanched, the sauces made. After that, a hot and spicy Sichuanese dry-braised fish will drive out winter chills and augur well for the year ahead. I’ve also included a dish made with an ingredient that was virtually unknown in China a few years ago but is now all the rage: okra. This sizzly stir-fry is laced, Hunan-style, with black beans and chilli – delicious. With a potful of rice, this menu will generously feed four. If you’re feeding more than four, the dongpo pork, bang bang chicken and spinach in ginger sauce can easily be doubled up. Alternatively, add other dishes or buy in Cantonese roast duck from a restaurant.All recipes serve 4 when eaten togetherThis beautiful, spicy fish lolls in a pool of red oil under a glamorous scattering of chopped scorched chillies. The cooking method is a version of the classic Sichuanese “dry-braising” (ganshao), in which the sauce is not thickened but simply reduced to a scant, aromatic cloak of seasonings. In Sichuan, they tend to use carp in London I’ve used both bream and sea bass to delicious effect. Please make sure you use chillies that are not excessively hot: although the dish should pack a punch, you want fragrance as well as heat.For the marinadesalt 1 tspShaoxing wine 1 tbspginger 25gspring onions 2, white parts onlysea bream or bass 1 fresh, scaled and gutted (700g)Sichuanese dried chillies 15gcooking oil around 140mlSichuan chilli bean paste 1 tbsp (doubanjiang)ginger 1 tbsp, finely choppedgarlic 2 tsp, finely choppedchicken stock 250mlShaoxing wine 1 tbsplight soy sauce 2 tspdark soy sauce ½ tspwhite sugar 1 tspChinkiang vinegar 1 tspspring onion greens 3 tbsp, finely slicedground roasted Sichuan pepper ¼-½ tspLay your fish on a board and make 5-6 diagonal cuts into the thickest part on each side, to allow the flavours to penetrate. Rub the fish, inside and out, with the marinade salt and wine. Smack the ginger and spring onion whites lightly with the flat of a cleaver blade or a rolling pin to loosen, then pop them into the belly of the fish. Set aside while you prepare the other ingredients.Using a pair of scissors, trim the stem ends of the chillies and snip them into sections shake out and discard the seeds as far as possible. Heat 4 tbsp of the oil in a seasoned wok over a medium flame. When the oil is hot but not smoking, add the chillies and fry briefly until crisp and dark red, then remove immediately with a slotted spoon. (If you burn the chillies, repeat with another batch!) When the chillies have cooled, chop finely. Retain the spicy cooking oil too.Discard the ginger and spring onion from the marinade and tip away any juices pat the fish dry. Return the wok to a high flame with 5 tbsp of fresh oil. Sprinkle a little salt around the base of the wok: this will help to prevent sticking. Add the fish and fry for a minute or two on each side until a little golden, tilting the wok for even browning. (Try not to disturb the fish until it is fairly well fried this will help keep the skin intact.) When the fish is done, remove carefully from the wok. Pour off the oil and rinse and dry the wok if necessary.Return the wok to a medium flame with the spicy chilli oil you have reserved. Add the chilli bean paste and stir-fry gently until the oil is red and wonderfully aromatic. Tip in the ginger and garlic and fry until they smell gorgeous. Then add the stock, Shaoxing wine, soy sauces, sugar and vinegar and turn the heat to high. Use a slotted spoon to strain out and discard the solids from the wok. Now slide the fish into the sauce. Let the liquid bubble away, spooning frequently over the fish until it has evaporated to leave a lazy, glossy sauce. Turn the fish over after about 2 minutes total cooking time should be about 4 minutes (poke a chopstick into the thickest part of the fish to make sure it’s cooked through: the flesh should flake easily from the backbone).Gently transfer the fish to a serving dish. Pour over the remaining sauce and scatter with the spring onions. Finally, scatter with the Sichuan pepper, if using, and all or some of the chopped fried chillies, to taste.The Observer aims to publish recipes for fish rated as sustainable by the Marine Conservation Society’s Good Fish GuideThis is a most refreshing starter, with juicy leaves in a delicate dressing of ginger, mellow vinegar and sesame oil. The combination of seasonings is known as “gingerjuice flavour”, and comes from the canon of classic Sichuanese flavour combinations. Do use bunched spinach for its wonderfully juicy texture (baby spinach leaves tend to melt away when you blanch them).bunched spinach 300g cooking oil 1 tbsp ginger 1 tbsp, very finely chopped Chinkiang vinegar 2 tsp light soy sauce 1 tsp stock or water 1½ tbsp saltsesame oil ½ tspBring a large panful of water to a boil (1-1.5 litres will do). Wash and trim the spinach, but keep the leaves whole. When the water has boiled, add the oil, then the spinach and blanch for about 30 seconds. Drain the spinach and refresh in cold water, then shake dry in a colander. Gently squeeze it to remove as much water as possible.Combine the ginger, vinegar, soy sauce and stock or water in a small bowl, with salt to taste. Add the sesame oil.Lay the spinach leaves out on a chopping board and cut them across into about four sections. Pile these sections neatly on a serving plate. Give the sauce a stir and pour it over the spinach.From The Food of Sichuan  (Bloomsbury)Bang bang chicken appears on countless Chinese restaurant menus in the west, but usually only as a shadow of its authentic self. In southern Sichuan, where the dish originates, the base seasoning of sesame paste is jazzed up with sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, chilli and sesame oils and Sichuan pepper to make a lip-tingling sauce. The dish is said to have originated in Hanyang Ba, a town near Leshan that was once known for its chickens: free-range birds that fed on insects, stray grains and leftovers from the local peanut crop. In the early 20th century, Hanyang street vendors sold chunks of cooked chicken meat draped in spicy sauce as a snack.The dish became known as bang bang chicken, because of the sound their wooden cudgels made when hammered down on the backs of cleaver blades to help them through the meat. It began to feature on Chengdu menus from about the 1920s, though here the cudgels were used to whack the meat directly, loosening the fibres so it could be torn into slivers by hand.I have found this recipe one of the most difficult to commit to paper, because I have enjoyed so many different versions of it. If you like, you can serve the chicken on a bed of slivered lettuce or sliced cucumber.poached chicken meat 400g, cold, off the bone (see below)spring onions 4, white parts only, cut into fine slivers (optional)roasted peanuts 30g sesame seeds 2 tspFor the saucesesame paste 2 tbspsalt ½ tspcaster sugar 1½ tsplight soy sauce 2 tbspChinkiang vinegar 1½ tspground roasted Sichuan pepper ¼-½ tsp, or 1-2 tsp Sichuan pepper oilchilli oil 4 tbsp, plus 1-2 tbsp sedimentsesame oil 2 tspFor the poached chickenchicken 1 x 1.6kg whole, to give 800g boneless meatginger 20gspring onions 2, white parts onlyTo make the poached chicken, let the chicken come to room temperature before you start. Lightly smack the ginger and spring onion whites with the flat of a cleaver blade or rolling pin to loosen them.Pour enough water to immerse your chicken into a lidded pan that will hold the bird snugly, and bring to the boil over a high flame. Lower the chicken into the water, return it quickly to the boil and then skim. Add the ginger and spring onion whites, half-cover the pan and turn the heat down so the liquid barely murmurs and poach for about 30 minutes, depending on the size of the chicken if any of the bird sits above the water level, turn it halfway through.Pierce the thigh joint deeply with a skewer to see if it is done: the juices should run clear, not pink and bloody. When the chicken is just cooked, remove it from the pan and set aside to cool before chilling until needed (to arrest the cooking quickly and keep the skin taut, immediately immerse the bird in a large pan or bowl of ice water). The flesh should be moist and silky.For the bang bang chicken, if you want to be traditional, pummel the meat with a rolling pin to loosen the fibres, and then tear into bite-sized slivers otherwise, simply tear or cut into bite-sized slivers or strips.Toss with the spring onion slivers, if using. Roughly chop the peanuts: the easiest way to do this is to gather them on a chopping board, lay the flat of a cleaver blade over them and press firmly to break them up a bit, then chop them into smaller pieces. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry wok or frying pan over a very gentle heat, until fragrant and tinged with gold.Next make the sauce. Dilute the sesame paste with a little oil from the jar and about 2 tbsp of cold water: you should end up with a paste the consistency of single cream – it needs to be runny≈enough to clothe the chicken. Place the salt, sugar, soy sauce and vinegar in a small bowl and stir to dissolve the salt and sugar. Add the remaining sauce ingredients and mix well.Shortly before serving, pile the chicken on to a serving dish and pour the sauce over it. Garnish with the peanuts and toasted sesame seeds.From The Food of Sichuan  (Bloomsbury)Until a few years ago, okra was all but unknown in China, but a sudden fashion for this originally African vegetable has swept the country and it now appears on the menu of almost every trendy restaurant. Local chefs prepare it in many ways, but this is the most delicious I’ve encountered: a simple, sizzly, Hunan-style stir-fry of the sliced pods with fermented black beans, garlic and fresh red chilli.The following recipe is my attempt to recreate one I tasted at the Shengyongxing restaurant in Beijing. You can adjust the chilli heat according to taste, but it’s best, in my opinion, to choose fresh red chillies that are colourful but not too hot (and you can substitute diced sweet red pepper if you prefer something that isn’t spicy at all).Top and tail the okra pods, and then slice at a steep diagonal angle into 1cm pieces. Do the same with the chillies, but with thinner slices. Peel and slice the garlic.Heat 2 tbsp of the cooking oil in a wok, add the okra and stir-fry over a high heat for 2-3 minutes, until the slices are piping hot, tender and slightly scorched around the edges. Remove from the wok and set aside.Tip the remaining cooking oil into the wok, add the black beans, garlic and ginger and stir-fry briefly over a high flame until they all smell delicious. Add the okra and mix everything together. Season with salt to taste.Off the heat, stir in the sesame oil and then serve.This sumptuous dish, named after the Song-dynasty poet Su Dongpo, is a Hangzhou speciality. Large square chunks of belly pork are slow-cooked with soy sauce, sugar and Shaoxing wine until they are so exquisitely tender that they melt away at a chopstick’s touch.While serving as governor of Hangzhou in the late 11th century, Su Dongpo organised the dredging of the city’s beautiful West Lake, which had become clogged. According to local lore, the grateful townspeople sent him gifts of his favourite meat for Chinese new year touched by their kindness, the poet-governor instructed a servant to red-braise the pork and return it with a gift of wine. The servant mistakenly thought he’d been told to cook the pork with the wine, and the resulting dish was so magnificent it has never been forgotten.The supposed rule with Dongpo pork is to let wine take the place of water in the stew, but in practice most chefs add a little water. Although it’s traditionally cooked on the stove-top, a low oven works very well too. The final dish is so rich and intense that one square of pork, served with plain rice, is usually enough for each person. Make it a day in advance and chill it if you want to remove the layer of solid fat that will collect on the surface. Do not make this dish with everyday Shaoxing cooking wine invest in a bottle of five- or 10-year aged drinking wine, found in good Chinese supermarkets.Happily, although this is one of the finest dishes in the whole pantheon of Chinese cooking, it’s very easy to make.belly pork 1 x 12cm-wide strip, unscored, skin on, boneless (about 1kg, or 1.3kg bone-in)spring onions 2fresh ginger 30g, skin oncaster sugar 4 tbsplight soy sauce 5½ tbspdark soy sauce ½ tbspgood Shaoxing wine 250mlplain white rice to serveIf using an oven, preheat it to 110Cgas mark ¼. Bring a large pan of water to the boil, add the pork and cook for about 5 minutes. Drain it well and rinse under the cold tap. Place the pork, skin-side up, on a chopping board and cut it as accurately as possible into 5cm squares. Keep any trimmings. If you have one, lay a bamboo mat in the bottom of a heavy-based pan to prevent sticking. Crush the spring onions and ginger slightly with the flat side of a Chinese cleaver or a rolling pin and put them in the pan. Add the pork trimmings and arrange the pork chunks, skin-side down, on top. Add the sugar, soy sauces and Shaoxing wine. If you are using a traditional Chinese clay pot, warm it gently over a low flame to prevent cracking, then bring it to the boil over a high flame if you are using a more robust pan, bring it to the boil directly.Boil rapidly for 1-2 minutes to give the skin a rich, soy-dark colour. Cover and cook gently for 2½ hours over a very low flame or in the oven. Keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn’t boil dry add a little hot water if necessary. Remove and discard the ginger and spring onions. For best results, leave the pork to cool in the pan and chill overnight.Scrape off and remove the layer of white fat on the surface (this can be used for other purposes, such as frying potatoes or stir-frying mushrooms).Reheat the pork in the pan, turning the pieces skin-side up as soon as the juices have loosened. You want to end up with a dark, slightly syrupy sauce: if there is too much liquid, strain it off, fast-boil to reduce it, then return it to the pan. Serve the meat and its juices with plain white rice.From Land of Fish and Rice (Bloomsbury)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2aed0751d6e70c14677adcbf71fcdc44d40a81a1/0_132_2700_1621/master/2700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91b6fb89da0ecdc4d7212a8191cb82ac","title":"liverpool manchester united first step victory parade unheard of achievement","story":"If the champions of Europe win the title undefeated they will have to be recognised as the best of the Premier League eraThey’re coming for you, they’re coming for you. The boys of ’99. Fergie and Eric. Andy and Dwight. Arsène, Thierry, Sergio and Pep. They’re coming for you.So much for the league and so much for Manchester United, who were awkward opponents at Anfield, without ever feeling like much more than a bump in the road. At the end of this 2-0 victory Liverpool will have something else in their sights.Whisper it but Jürgen Klopp’s team have a shot at a genuine legacy season here, a sense of ultimacy beyond the basic business of titles and cups, a chance to win in a way nobody has quite won before.One thing is certain. They won’t stop chasing it. With a minute left in added time at Anfield Mo Salah could be seen surging once more down the left flank, bumping away the last United defender, before punting the ball under David de Gea to kill a game that had spent the previous hour and a half doggedly refusing to die.The feeling around the ground at that moment was distinct from the usual triumphalism. As the players lined up in an oddly formal crocodile to shake hands there was a feeling for the first time of a step into something else of this Liverpool team setting off on what could turn into an extended victory lap, high-fiving the bases, that small white ball still rising as it clears the stadium roof and disappears across the skyline.Liverpool must surely lose a league game somewhere. Common sense and human error dictate it. But now there are only 16 of them left.Some of those games look tricky. Away to Wolves on Thursday, for a start. Not to mention trips to Goodison in March and Manchester City in April. Arsenal at the Emirates in May could have the feel of a last stand for the Invincibles. But they’re ticking down now. And at some point that focus will narrow to a point.Facile as it may be to compare eras, football won’t stop doing it. And there is a fresh mark to be set here. Liverpool became club champions of the world last month. Should they go on to win the league undefeated it will be hard to argue with the idea this is the best one-off team the Premier League has produced, the best season of all the champion seasons.This game always looked like one of the more obvious hurdles, a visit from the keepers of the recent past. United have an interest in this as the club that dominated the early years of the Premier League so completely it is still hard to shake that feeling of ownership.Squint a little and there was a vague feeling at Anfield of ghosts stalking the fringes, a spectral Frenchman, collar up, lurking just out of your line of vision, Sparky in green and yellow harlequins, the resonance of Fergie-time.And United did play quite well here. Ole Gunnar Solskjær had hinted at a cunning plan for this game, and the change of shape to a three-man backline was a qualified success.There was disruption at the start to Liverpool’s normal patterns, beige United shirts in unusual spaces clogging the passing lines.The plan seemed to be working, right up until the moment it stopped working 14 minutes in, when Virgil van Dijk decided to pull rank. Never mind the tactical dance. Here is a man to whom the ball itself seems bashfully attracted.Trent Alexander-Arnold’s corner was hung with just enough speed to allow Van Dijk to hover briefly above the city of Liverpool and butt the ball high into the net.Is there a more imposing aerial presence anywhere? Is there a more daunting man-marking task for a 5ft 6in junior left-back in his first game at Anfield?Is there any coherent reason why international defenders would allow this scenario to develop without intervening, for the £80m defensive rock Harry Maguire to look on and think, “Yeah, why not?”After which the afternoon unravelled into something agreeably haphazard. Liverpool had two first-half goals chalked off. Salah missed a sitter. Jordan Henderson hit a post.There was a two-minute interlude where Liverpool’s three-man attack squared up against United’s three-man defence and basically stalked them back into their own penalty area, like battle-hardened mountain wolves closing in on a flock of geriatric sheep. For a while in the second half Fred appeared from nowhere and briefly ran the game, zipping passes about, pirouetting in space, before vanishing from this earthy plane once again.At the end of which Liverpool can march on towards something that feels close enough to have assumed a recognisable shape. Part of the story will be the ways they have found to win. Liverpool have not conceded a goal in the league in seven matches since the first week of December as the Van Dijk-Gomez partnership has shifted to another plane.It is this solidity that looks most ominous for every other champion team of the recent past. Sixteen games to win them all, to take a shot at the ultimate reward not just for the surging energy of this team but for success stretching back far beyond the pitch, the feeling of thoroughbred expertise in every aspect of this club, from intelligence-driven recruitment to the cult of the Klopp personality. From here you really wouldn’t bet against it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/840e8785b7c510bdcd3f91dcb15c8e7c78d391bd/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f858ec9e938754f0b55fc85446bef60e","title":"premier league 10 talking points from the weekends action","story":"Grealish, Saka and Chalobah shine in draws, while Newcastle are ready for reinforcements after a late winArsenal’s injury problems at left‑back have led them to explore signing Layvin Kurzawa from Paris Saint-Germain. But what if the solution lies closer to home? Bukayo Saka is 18 and earlier this season was being rightly lauded for his rich promise as a flying winger. But he has filled in at full‑back four times in the past month, most recently against Sheffield United on Saturday, and looks the part. Saka is tenacious, diligent, has speed and energy to burn and a knack of picking out teammates with his deliveries. “I think he could,” Mikel Arteta said when asked if Saka could carve out a long-term future in the role. “He is someone that’s never played there before but he’s really trying to do it as well as possible. You can see that he’s got many strengths to play in that position.” Club and manager might have hit upon something far more exciting than they expected. Nick AmesEngland fans will have only Gareth Southgate to blame if Jack Grealish is not in their next squad. The player could hardly do more to prove he deserves a chance. His terrific goal at Brighton was the latest evidence of his exceptional ability. He has the skills and attitude to fit into a variety of positions and has shown at Aston Villa that he thrives on responsibility. “He’s turned into an all-round player,” said Dean Smith, Villa’s manager. “He keeps pushing us as coaches to make him better. When you’ve got that attitude, that application, then he’s going to be a top player. People will take notice of him, that’s for sure, and he’s doing what he can to get himself noticed for the England squad.” Grealish has scored seven league goals this season – his best haul. With him and Villa’s new striker, Mbwana Samatta, the club can be confident of climbing out of relegation trouble. Paul DoyleBrendan Rodgers was not being peevish when he said Leicester deserved to win this game. They created most of the chances and, but for an exceptional goalkeeping performance by Nick Pope, would probably have gone home with something. “Somehow we lost,” the Leicester manager said. Crucial saves from Pope were the most obvious reason, particularly when denying Jamie Vardy from the penalty spot in the second half, though Rodgers also thought he could detect a drop in desire and motivation. Leicester’s passing ability was superior but they were unable to make it count. While they remain a good bet for a top‑four finish it is possible they are finding it hard to keep up their earlier pace. “The character is strong but maybe the confidence isn’t as strong as it has been,” Rodgers said. “I’m sure we’ll get it back.” Paul WilsonRoberto Firmino’s disallowed goal could be argued over for eternity but there is no debating that it involved a desperately timid piece of goalkeeping from David de Gea. The Spaniard was impressive thereafter but he plays in an unforgiving position and what will stick in the mind is his meekness in coming to meet a high ball – strikingly similar to his costly mistake against Everton last month. Watford, Chelsea, Arsenal, Barcelona and Portugal have also benefited from De Gea blunders in recent memory and they are only the most glaring. The 29-year-old has been a rare jewel in the rubble of the post-Ferguson years but it is no exaggeration to say that he is in danger of becoming a liability. His club can, however, lay claim to a keeper with the joint‑most clean sheets in the ision: Dean Henderson. Time for De Gea to worry? Alex HessRoy Hodgson felt compelled to defend John Stones after the defender had another shaky outing that culminated in him allowing Wilfried Zaha to force Fernandinho’s late own-goal equaliser. Hodgson, who gave Stones his international debut when England manager, said: “John is a good player – young, too. He still has his best years ahead of him, he’s still learning the game, learning it in a fantastic environment with very good players around him. I still think that John Stones is every bit that we expected him to be. But he’s playing in a very important goldfish bowl at the moment. Every mistake or every good thing is magnified 10 times over. He’s very much a player that City and England will have good use from in the future. It’s for Pep to decide.” Guardiola voiced rare public criticism of the “mistake” that prompted Fernandinho’s blunder. Jamie JacksonMatt Ritchie celebrated Isaac Hayden’s last-gasp winner by kicking the corner flag into the crowd – where it hit a Newcastle fan in the groin, leaving him in agony. Frank Lampard and Chelsea probably felt much the same after monopolising possession and having 19 shots on target. What the bald statistics do not reveal is the visitors often passed sideways and created mainly half‑chances. While Reece James shone for Chelsea at right‑back the other contenders for man of the match were all Newcastle players. They should shortly be joined by the Austria winger Valentino Lazaro after a provisional loan agreement was reached with Internazionale. Lazaro can expect some expert “out of possession” training‑ground tutelage from Steve Bruce and his assistant Steve Agnew. The defensive masterclass here was not accidental. Louise TaylorThe January transfer window has offered little of note so far but one move that flew under the radar when it went through last week was Norwich’s signing of Ondrej Duda on loan from Hertha Berlin. On the face of it a slight, technical midfielder is hardly the sort of player required in a relegation dogfight – especially by a team who have conceded the most goals in the ision and already possess Todd Cantwell and Emiliano Buendía. Yet Duda – who scored 11 times in the Bundesliga last season – slotted into the team alongside both and was his side’s standout performer, dictating the tempo with his crisp passing and denied a debut goal only by the illegal acrobatics of Steve Cook. If Norwich go down, they will go down playing sparkling football. But if Duda plays like that every week, they might just get the best of both worlds. Alex HessAfter a stirring comeback victory it would have been easy for Nuno Espírito Santo to be cavalier but the Wolves head coach acknowledged such a result does not alter the need for reinforcements. The shirt numbers of his substitutes at St Mary’s read akin to lottery numbers and the average age was 22. As it happened, Nuno’s tactical switch changed the game – Adama Traoré caused havoc centrally – but Wolves had few options on a bench which featured two teenagers, including Ryan Giles who was recalled from Shrewsbury last week. Wolves rallied but Nuno recognised he needs to add to his supporting cast, with backup for the match-winner, Raúl Jiménez, in short supply after Patrick Cutrone joined Fiorentina on loan. “This window is not the best one to do things but we need to,” he said. “We already have a good team but we need to improve.” Ben FisherThe West Ham fans who protested against David Sullivan and David Gold before this draw with Everton will be paying close attention to whether the board reacts to a growing injury list by backing David Moyes in the transfer market. Missing Felipe Anderson, Michail Antonio and Andriy Yarmolenko, West Ham lacked ideas in the second half and did not have many attacking options on a bench containing three centre‑backs, an untried youngster, a left-back and Albian Ajeti, a forward whose only contribution was jutting his head into Mason Holgate’s jaw after replacing Manuel Lanzini. Moyes admitted concern about the lack of support for the £45m striker Sébastien Haller. With a trip to Leicester on Wednesday, a double‑header with Liverpool, games at Arsenal and Tottenham and visits from Chelsea and Wolves, West Ham need reinforcements.

Britain cannot afford to be left behindAfrica is the coming continent. Its population is predicted to double to 2 billion people over the next three decades. That growth will mean enormous opportunities for business and investment, but will also create huge challenges around sustainability and the environment.An Africa focus is therefore essential, particularly for a post-Brexit Britain.The 2020 UK-Africa Investment summit, which takes place in London on Monday, should be the occasion to open a new chapter in Britain’s relationship with Africa.Up to now, despite the significant amounts of aid Britain spends and the strong political and diplomatic footprint it has in Africa, investment lags.Between 2014 and 2018, UK direct investment into Africa was $17bn (£13bn), well below China’s $72bn, France’s $34bn, the US’s $31bn, and the United Arab Emirates’ $25bn. This needs to change. Africa provides a huge opportunity for the UK to maintain its global economic standing: one in every four consumers worldwide will be African by 2050, while eight of the 15 fastest growing economies are in Africa.There is a fresh competition for influence in Africa. Beyond China and its ever-strengthening and well-documented presence, Germany is proactive in encouraging investment by its large manufacturers – such as Siemens and Volkswagen – in countries like Rwanda and Ghana. France is evolving its relationship with Africa to one that invests in adding local value, for example through Alstom’s train manufacturing venture in South Africa and Renault’s new plans for a plant in Ghana. Nations like India, Turkey, Russia, Brazil, the Netherlands and Israel are scaling up investment, trade and economic cooperation.Many African governments have set investment as their top development priority. Current levels will still leave Africa with a “jobs gap” of 50 million by 2040. So they want a switch to investment that creates value and jobs on the continent, through manufacturing, agro-processing, tourism and information and communications technology.The unequivocal demand I hear from African leaders is for investment that will spur the industrialisation of the continent and eradicate poverty – a pressing challenge, given the population growth and the fourth industrial revolution.One issue we need to address is the gap between the real and perceived risk of investing. We need to engage countries in improving the environment for business. PVH, which produces clothing brands like Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, has invested successfully in Ethiopia, as has Vodafone in Ghana and Kenya. The key element in each case was an effective collaboration between the investor and the government.Effective dialogue is critical to address the main bottlenecks holding back transactions, and to set a suitable regulatory and enabling environment for transformative sectors. There is a new commitment from presidents and civil servants to improve conditions for transformative private investment – from Senegal to Mozambique, and from Kenya to Ivory Coast. It is a strong basis for optimism.But effective government is key. My institute is releasing two case studies on industrialisation – one on Ethiopia’s manufacturing sector and the other on Tamil Nadu, one of India’s best-performing states. I believe they show how transformative private investment was underpinned by effective government with visionary and empowered local leadership. They also show that building institutional capability for the enabling environment takes time.The London conference is an opportunity for the UK government to change the framing of its relationship with Africa, to one based on economic cooperation rather than simply an aid-based, donor-recipient relationship. While aid is important, the nature of the relationship, and of aid itself, must increasingly be centred on countries’ own plans for their industrialisation. In this way we can be more responsive to Africa’s emerging class of leaders, who know that the future of Africa lies in African hands.Establishing economic cooperation partnerships with African countries – such as scaled up versions of the one the UK launched late last year with Ghana – is essential to support governments to fix bottlenecks and facilitate investment in job-creating sectors. As the UK rethinks its standing in the world, Africa needs to be front and centre of its plans. If we can use the UK-Africa investment summit to become a true economic partner to African countries, it would be of great strategic benefit to the continent and to the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a21927abe8a813470a86d6dd98aded80e2690cc1/0_471_7000_4201/master/7000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a44874d88ae9377d9a082d464e63e1b0","title":"peak happiness peak misery 47 psychology wellbeing","story":"So,” I say to my wife, “I’ve been asked to write about happiness peaking when we hit 47.2 years of age.” She stares at me like she’s waiting for a punchline, then shakes her head. “Because I’m about to hit 47.2,” I say, in case she had forgotten that we recently celebrated my 47th birthday. “A team of economists have worked it out.”There is an uncomfortable pause. My wife shakes her head again and says gently: “No, 47.2 is when you hit peak misery. It’s been all over the papers. Have you not been reading them? I was going to send you the links but I didn’t want you to have some sort of meltdown.”This is devastating information. I feel a little like PG Wodehouse’s Freddie Widgeon, who “experienced the sort of abysmal soul-sadness which afflicts one of Tolstoy’s Russian peasants when, after putting in a heavy day’s work strangling his father, beating his wife and dropping the baby into the city’s reservoir, he turns to the cupboards, only to find the vodka bottle empty”.Far from being happy, I am wallowing in the slough of despond. With hindsight, the signs that I am gripped by a midlife crisis were all too obvious. The incessant running, to the point of exhaustion the appearance in the bathroom of a certain type of “shampoo” that should miraculously turn my hair a lustrous brown the urgent need to repeatedly punch myself in the face when I hear politicians like Barry Gardiner or Iain Duncan Smith on the Today programme the decision to read Jordan B Peterson’s 12 Rules for Life twice in the same month.My fate is sealed – it’s hard to argue otherwise. Not in the face of the voluminous research carried out by the eminent economist Professor David Blanchflower, who studied data from 132 countries as he gauged the relationship between wellbeing and age.Blanchflower is the go-to expert on happiness. By my calculation, since the millennium he has written at least 20 papers on the subject. He and Professor Andrew Oswald “Money, sex and happiness: an empirical study”, which found that found that sexual activity appears to have greater effects on the happiness of highly educated people, than on those with low levels of education the thought-provoking “Is psychological wellbeing linked to the consumption of as does eating more fruit and vegetables?” (also with Oswald), which linked rises in happiness and mental health to the number of daily portions of fruit and vegetables and, with another academic, David Bell, the provocative “The Scots may be brave but they are neither healthy nor happy”, which found the wellbeing of Scots lower than that of the English or the Welsh.What is striking about all this work is its consistency. Blanchflower first identified a U-shaped happiness curve in a paper published in 2007, which found that “wellbeing reaches a minimum, on both sides of the Atlantic, in people’s mid-to-late 40s”. One point from Blanchflower’s studies is that no matter where you are, money can’t buy you happiness. His latest work – carried out when unemployment is at historic lows in many countries – confirms this. He pinpoints 47.2 as the age of peak unhappiness in the developed world, and 48.2 in developing nations.“The curve’s trajectory holds true in countries where the median wage is high and where it is not, and where people tend to live longer and where they don’t,” Blanchflower says in the study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. But this is not to say that our wellbeing is independent of external events.“The onset of the Great Recession (following the banking crisis of 2008) seems to have particularly impacted the prime age and especially those with low levels of education,” Blanchflower, 67, told me via email from Key West, where the temperature was 27C and he described himself as happy.In the US, he says, the academics Angus Deaton and Anne Case have documented deaths of despair especially relating to these groups from suicide and drug poisonings.Blanchflower’s work suggests when people are at their least happy, but not why. Attempts to bridge this gap, to meld the fields of economics and psychology, became fashionable shortly after the millennium and then bled into the political world. Since 2005, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has published its How’s Life? survey, which charts the wellbeing of people in 41 countries. In 2007, the economist Richard Layard was made the UK’s happiness tsar. The next year, the French president Nicolas Sarkozy asked the rock-star economists Amartya Sen, Joseph Stiglitz and Jean-Paul Fitoussi to find alternatives to GDP as a measure of a country’s health. The idea was revived last year when the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, pledged her government would put wellbeing at the centre of its budgets.While Blanchflower believes politicians now understand the need to take happiness seriously, he fears they do not appreciate their role in its delivery. “They are getting happiness more but I think we need to understand that politicians imposed failed reckless austerity, which broke down social ties even more.”As the west endures an explosion of depression and loneliness, society must look itself in the mirror, says Blanchflower, who thinks the keys to happiness are “friends, family and a supporting community”. “It seems society does value happiness more these days but not enough – we are having an explosion of depression and loneliness. In the US, pain is up even though 100 billion pain meds are distributed, according to the Washington Post.”If Blanchflower’s work is correct, politicians keen on improving wellbeing need to prioritise middle-aged people, which seems counter-intuitive given the pressures facing younger people today. As Layard writes in today’s Observer New Review: “The rise in competitiveness has been made much worse by the advent of social media, which have encouraged self-advertisement and made more young people feel inadequate, anxious, depressed and ‘left out’.”But there are compensations for being young, Blanchflower argues. “Young people have more energy and fewer responsibilities!” he emailed, the exclamation mark revealing the fervour with which he holds this belief. He has a theory as to why we hit a nadir in our 40s: “Life seems to get complex and it is a struggle to strike out on your own.”This strikes a chord. Before my 40s I had few cares. Life was simple and many places – schools, hospitals, doctors’ surgeries, creches, nurseries, playgrounds – were alien to me. Now that I have a child, a wife and elderly relatives to consider, life is a shuttle between these places.I have a job that has resolutely plateaued for the past two decades and, thanks to familial responsibilities, a squeezed disposable income. I crave sleep. My body is disintegrating. I spend my time obsessing about air pollution and knife crime.And gradually something is dawning on me: I will never represent my country in any sport no one is going to be calling me from Sweden with an invitation to collect a Nobel Gregg and John are never going to say to me: “Mate, that was an awesome tiramisu.”And yet there is something hopeful in Blanchflower’s U-shaped curve and its promise that after 47.2 lies a better tomorrow. As Blanchflower says: “Once you get there, I think you get more realistic – and happier.”Indeed, if I have learned anything as I hit the age of 47.2, it can be summarised in the observation of Frank Bascombe, the main character, aged 44, in Richard Ford’s The Sportswriter. “For your life to be worth anything, you must sooner or later face the possibility of terrible, searing regret – though you must also manage to avoid it or your life will be ruined. I believe I have done these two things. Faced down regret. Avoided ruin. And I am still here to tell about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19eb48a15af495eca4ef08adb1ce76f203f005d5/0_255_8658_5195/master/8658.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54a47dd17531933fc6a4729310f7db39","title":"try novella ditch snobbery five ways to read more books","story":"Reading is good for the brain and the soul, but we don’t always find the time, the inclination – or the right book. That can be easily changedStruggling to find the time to read could suggest you are reading the wrong books. Sian Cain, the ’s books site editor, says people often aspire to read books they feel they “should”, rather than ones they actually want to read, then end up putting them off. “Get over your snobbery, as there is literally a book for everyone out there.” John Rampton, an entrepreneur who has written about building a voracious reading habit, adds: “If I go for one or two books that are just OK, my rhythm gets thrown off.”Marvin Marcano, a personal development coach who reads a book a week, says ersifying your reading – more genres, or more than one book on the go at once – will inevitably result in you reading more. “This way you make it a priority because it’s fun. If you get burnt out, you can always go to something else.” If you are a very slow reader, try novellas and short stories so you can finish a book before you lose interest.Rampton schedules time to do it – typically 15 to 20 minutes, twice a day, for his commute. Over a working week, that comes to roughly three hours of reading, even without the weekends. “I have to block out time for this on my calendar or it won’t happen. Other things will take priority if you let them.” Joining a book club can help with this by committing you to finishing a book before a certain date. Katie Cunningham, a journalist who completed her new year resolution to read 52 books in 2019, says joining a library was a “gamechanger”: “You have a hard deadline to get it finished by.” If it is an ebook or an audiobook, it’s still a book. If you have a podcast habit, Cain suggests making the switch to audiobooks, which can be consumed on your commute or at the gym. “If you look at your phone a lot when you know you could be reading, download an ebook app. I do this when I know I’ll be standing, which was my excuse for not reading on the train but staring at my phone anyway.” Cain always has an ebook on the go – “while also having a print book for comfy reading”.Services such as Blinkist that condense books into “key takeaways” are increasingly capitalising on the desire to read more books in a shorter period of time. “It is not the equivalent of reading,” says Cain. As with exercise, making time for reading becomes easier with repetition. “It is 100 times easier when you’ve made it a habit,” she says. “Even setting your alarm for 30 minutes before you’d normally go to bed, so you can spend that set time in bed reading, is a good idea.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9bf731c2c9eb2eb6ffd2dbda688af78891de9d6/228_375_3093_1856/master/3093.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a23d688820db887053ffc869e5b6570","title":"sarah montague wins 400000 settlement from bbc for unequal treatment","story":"Radio 4 presenter also receives apology after ‘long period of stressful negotiation’The radio presenter Sarah Montague has won a £400,000 settlement and an apology from the BBC after being treated “unequally” for many years.Montague, 53, who previously presented BBC Radio 4’s Today programme alongside John Humphrys, said the deal came after a long period of stressful negotiations, which was triggered after discovering a disparity in her pay and conditions.Montague, who presents the World At One on BBC Radio 4 and the Hardtalk interview on television, tweeted: “I would prefer not to be talking about my pay but feel I have no option given the erroneous reports in today’s papers.“Here are the facts: when I discovered the disparity in my pay and conditions, I was advised that rectifying it all could run into the millions.

National newspapers made £275m in digital advertising last year, regional titles £212m and magazine publishers £271m.In the UK, the most-searched phrase on Google last year was the Rugby World Cup. However, according to the report many of the most-read articles fell foul of ad-blocking for the use of phrases such as “attack” and “injury”. Some articles on Avengers: Endgame, the highest-grossing film of all-time, also suffered as they contained “attack” and “kill”.One senior executive at a UK media agency, which handles the advertising for numerous household-name brands, cited a case of being asked by a client to create a blacklist comprised of “any negative words”. Another agency executive knows of multiple advertisers who added the word “is” to their blacklists, wanting to avoid having ads appear around material on the Islamic State (Isis) militant group, virtually guaranteeing zero ads appearing on any news sites. Wildman says that the word Manchester is still on many blacklists three years after the bombing at an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena.“Advertising technology can be very, very blunt and isn’t sophisticated enough to discern between genuinely harmful content and acceptable content,” said Rob Lynam, a media executive who has worked in ad agencies and at the publisher of the Daily Mail. “There are good intentions but I don’t think anyone has really realised who it is punishing the most or to what extent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37b29f8665719a7bcd97bff51c41f54c42dabb2a/0_94_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dba510dcf2ed597b8ddfd3164dc8e56","title":"share your experiences of once in a lifetime jobs","story":"After hundreds apply to run a café on a remote Irish island, we’d like to hear about your one-of-a-kind job experiences Do you dream of quitting the rat race and moving to a remote island to run a B\u0026ampB, book shop or animal sanctuary?

The presenter expressed surprise, because the official budget for the project at that point was just £88bn. but Johnson stuck to his guns. He said he thought the final bill would be “north of £1oobn”.Perhaps Johnson knew more than he was letting on. Today’s Financial Times says a leak of the review of HS2 by Doug Oakervee says it could cost up to £106bn. The FT story is here (paywall) and our own follow-up is here.According to the FT, the Oakervee review says that “on balance” HS2 should continue, but it recommends that work on the link from the West Midlands to Manchester and Leeds be put on hold for six months to explore whether it could be made up of a mix of standard and high-speed rail.Speaking on the Today programme this morning, Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said watering down what was proposed for the route north of Birmingham in this way would be unacceptable. He said:I’m worried by the suggestion that there might be a delay in the north, or even that we might get some kind of second-class option, a mix of high-speed and conventional lines that it’s talking about.And to me that would be the same old story. London to Birmingham, money is no object, and then all the penny pinching is done in the North of England.That would not be acceptable to me, and I’m sure wouldn’t be acceptable to many other leaders across the north.Burnham also said the development of an east-west rail route across the Nnorth - known as HS3 or Northern Powerhouse Rail - relied on HS2 being built. He explained:This isn’t just about north-south rail. The point about HS2 is it lays the enabling infrastructure for the east-west links that we crucially need and most people here would say that those are even more important.This is about building a railway for the north, right across the north, for the rest of the century.And that’s why I don’t support the idea that we will see downgrading of what is done north of Birmingham.That would be fundamentally unacceptable. If we get to a position where trains can go high-speed into Birmingham and then trundle their way north, then I’m sorry but that just isn’t good enough.The first official party hustings in the Labour leadership contest took place on Saturday, in Liverpool, and some observers said afterwards that the format made it all a bit dull and inconclusive. Under the rules drawn up by party HQ, candidates were given just 40 seconds to answer questions, and they were not allowed to interrupt each other or ask each other questions. Paul Mason, the Labour-supporting journalists, said this arrangements was “dire”.Now it seems at least two of the candidates agree with him.In an article for the  Jess Phillips says she thought that she performed badly, and that the format was partly to blame. She says:The hustings was awful. I was awful because I was trying to hit a million different lines and messages in 40 seconds. Some were my lines, some were other people’s, and it fell flat.It was not all my failing. The format of the hustings is terrible. To answer any question in 40 seconds is ridiculous. If it were possible to sum up, for example, an economic plan or an industrial strategy in 40 seconds, one wonders why they are actually hundreds of pages long. What a ridiculous farce.And now, as HuffPost’s Paul Waugh reports, Lisa Nandy has written to Labour’s general secretary, Jennie Formby, asking her to change the rules. She says the candidates should be given more than 40 seconds to reply to questions, and allowed to engage with each other. She says:We need these hustings to ignite a passionate debate in our party and this cannot be achieved by proscribing answers to 40 second sound bites and hermetically sealing the candidates from direct conversations between ourselves.The next official hustings is due in Leeds on Saturday. We will find out later what Labour HQ has to say about the Nandy request.Here is the agenda for the day.9.30am: The UK-Africa investment summit opens. Boris Johnson is hosting it.

A YouTube prank site has claimed responsibility for planting a “fart box” in the Alexandra Palace crowd earlier this week.The 2015 world champion didn’t let the incident put him off his stride and, after trailing 7-5, he won four frames in a row and sealed victory with his first century of the tournament."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05a5ed5c8730720390cbb25f91786cddad5d6614/0_127_3792_2276/master/3792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58bc535b6944380eba249c46223a1f4b","title":"raheem mostert runs packers ragged as 49ers reach super bowl","story":"Raheem Mostert rushed for 220 yards and four touchdowns to make quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo mostly a spectator, Nick Bosa harassed Aaron Rodgers from the start and the San Francisco 49ers beat the Green Bay Packers 37-20 for the NFC championship on Sunday.The 49ers advanced to their first Super Bowl in seven years and will play the Kansas City Chiefs in two weeks in Miami for the championship.“Our team, it’s incredible to be a part of,” Garoppolo said after the game. “We can win so many different ways. Raheem, those guys up front, the tight ends obviously were just dominating tonight. It was fun.”It’s been a remarkable turnaround for a team that won just 10 games in the first two seasons under coach Kyle Shanahan and general manager John Lynch and had the No2 pick in the most recent draft.Now, San Francisco are one of two teams left standing after delivering a second thorough beating of the season to Rodgers and the Packers. The Niners are the third team to make it to the Super Bowl a year after winning four or fewer games, joining Cincinnati (1988) and the Rams (1999).Bosa, the prize for last year’s rough season as the No2 overall pick, helped set the tone when he ended Green Bay’s second drive of the game with a 13-yard sack of Rodgers. Mostert, a former special teams standout, did much of the rest in a remarkable redemption story for a former surfer who was cut seven times and carried the ball only eight times in his first three seasons in the NFL. But he has become a key part of the NFC’s top team this year, leading the Niners with 772 yards rushing in the regular season and delivering a performance for the ages in the NFC title game. He had the second-most yards rushing in a playoff game to Eric Dickerson’s 248 for the Rams in January 1986, and was the first player to rush for at least four TDs and 200 yards in a playoff game.“You know, honestly, I just woke up like it was any other game,” Mostert said. “It was one of those things where hey, once we all get in a groove, we’re just going to keep it riding, keep it going and that’s what we did.”Rodgers had a career-low 3.15 yards per attempt in a 37-8 loss here back in November and wasn’t much better in the first half of the rematch. He lost a snap from center to end Green Bay’s only promising drive of the half, threw an interception to Emmanuel Moseley late in the half and didn’t convert his first third-down of the season against the Niners until connecting on a six-yard pass to Aaron Jones on the opening drive of the second quarter. Rodgers capped that drive with a nine-yard TD pass to Jones, but the game was too far out of hand by that point. He led Green Bay to two more TDs and finished with 326 yards passing, but it wasn’t nearly enough as the Packers lost the NFC title game for the third time since their last Super Bowl trip following the 2010 season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/615c9974501ad8ee6e50733a03e31d75c95b1389/0_246_3690_2214/master/3690.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f665d35f1ae5190780cd312f8fecac0","title":"australian open 2020 day one barty v tsurenko djokovic in action and more live","story":"Third set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-0 6-2 *3-1 Salvatore Caruso: Meanwhile, Stefanos Tsitsipas continues to ease through his opening match. The Greeks are chanting at every opportunity, Tsitsipas is crushing forehands and life is good. Tsitsipas now has 21 winners and 13 unforced errors, having lost only one point on his serve so far today.Caruso seems to be having a problem with his blisters and he has the trainer on to deal with the plasters wrapped across almost every finger.Third set: Ashleigh Barty 5-7 6-1 *1-0 Lesia Tsurenko: Barty gets the perfect start with an easy break to open the third set. Barty missed her first two opportunities from 0-40, but then Tsurenko very helpfully provided a double fault on the third. Finally, Barty is back in the lead.That was a very good recovery from Barty, who slowly shook off the nerves and, by the end, was playing her tennis with something approaching freedom. She held in spectacular fashion with a wicked second serve that forced the Ukrainian to duck out of the way. Just 5 unforced errors in this set from Barty after 19 in the first.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 5-7 *5-1 Lesia Tsurenko: Ashleigh Barty breaks again! After a brilliant backhand passing shot forced a hopeless backhand volley from Tsurenko at 30-30, Barty made her move on break point with the most brilliant rally of the match: a long lung-busting exchange, in which Barty calmly worked the Ukrainian off the court before forcing a forehand error. She stands one game away from levelling the match.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 5-7 4-1* Lesia Tsurenko: Much better work from Barty to retain the break by holding with style and guile. At 30-15, she froze time with a floating sliced backhand, forcing an error from Tsurenko. At 40-15, she hooked a beautiful angled forehand crosscourt, dragging Tsurenko well out of the court before slicing an easy backhand into the open court. Lovely.It appears that Serena Williams had an amusing press conference today after her breezy 6-0 6-3 win over Anastasia Potapova.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 5-7 *3-1 Lesia Tsurenko: Tsurenko drags herself into the second set with an important hold. Barty is certainly playing better in the second set but the nerves are still clear: at 30-30, with the possibility of a break point looming, Barty sprayed a poor backhand well wide and then she handed over the game another forehand error. Second set: Ashleigh Barty 5-7 3-0* Lesia Tsurenko: Barty does indeed serve well, sealing a second consecutive hold with an unreturned first serve. For the first time today she has consolidated a break and is firmly in the lead in set two. Now let’s see if she can keep it.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 5-7 *2-0 Lesia Tsurenko: Tsurenko has officially gone off the boil again. With a double fault at 15-15, then two bad forehand errors, she hands over the opening break. Based on the first set, Tsurenko will surely find her range again. Barty needs to take advantage while she can by serving well here.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 5-7 1-0* Lesia Tsurenko: A much better start from Barty in set two. She finds her first serve and then slots a forehand down the line winner in to open with a calm, solid hold. She needs to build on this.The nerves! Tsurenko opened with a double fault, and then at 15-30 she hit a second horrific double fault that flew well wide of the tram lines. But Barty just couldn’t keep her forehand in the court, closing off the set with her 19th unforced error so far today. The quality may not be high, but this is certainly gripping. A huge upset is officially on the cards.It’s not to be for the former Australian number one, who falls in another first round yet again. Keep an eye out for 18 year old qualifier McNally, who plays such a great all-court game and loves the net. A great future prospect.Stosur will shift to the doubles, where she is defending champion.First set: Ashleigh Barty 5-6* Lesia Tsurenko: Oh dear. The momentum swings away from Barty once more as Tsurenko wins two successive games. Tsurenko put genuine pressure on Barty’s serve with deep, consistent returning, and in the return game she continued to step into and take risks when she can, but across the net there are just too many errors from the world number one. The Ukrainian will serve for the set.First set: Ashleigh Barty 5-4* Lesia Tsurenko: This is turning into a bit of a breakathon as Barty breaks back to love. As expected, Tsurenko can play well for periods but she’s struggling to maintain a consistent level. After a series of errors to give up her own service game, Tsurenko struggled to get her racquet on any Barty serve. 8 points in a row and Barty is back in the lead.Second set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-0 1-0* Salvatore Caruso: Meanwhile, Tsitsipas has begun his Australian Open perfectly, snatching the opening set with a bagel. He is serving extremely well, sweeping forward to the net when he can and playing such flowing attacking tennis.First set: Ashleigh Barty 3-4* Lesia Tsurenko: A great response from Tsurenko after Barty looked to be elevating to another level. She took more risks in her return game, crushing a backhand return winner and then finishing a really nice point at the net. After a netted forehand from Barty, she breaks again. This is tough!First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas 5-0* Salvatore Caruso: The Greek fans are chanting loud and Tsitsipas is giving them plenty to sing about as he chases a first set bagel. Tsitsipas is 1010 on first serve points won with 7 winners and 4 errors. Mostly flawless.First set: Ashleigh Barty 3-2* Lesia Tsurenko: Not surprisingly, the world number one has settled down after collecting her first game. She has found her range on her forehand, she is moving better and she is serving incredibly well today. After breaking back to love, she then held to love with her 5th(!) ace of the day. 10 points in a row for Barty.It’s official: all matches on outside courts have been cancelled due to rain. That includes Kyle Edmund, who lead Dusan Lajovic 5-2 before the rain came. Johanna Konta’s match was rescheduled earlier.First set: Ashleigh Barty 1-2* Lesia Tsurenko: Barty finally gets on the board, but this is far from easy at the moment. The world number one looks extremely nervous and she is missing plenty of routine shots early on. Thankfully, her serve is already firing and she produced a timely ace at 30-30 before showcasing her delicate hands with some deft touch to hold. That should calm some nerves.First set: Stefanos Tsitsipas *2-0 Salvatore Caruso: Last year’s breakout Australian Open semi-finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas is also on the court against Salvatore Caruso of Italy and he opens with a solid hold and immediate break.It seems like the general consensus is that the younger generation will have some big opportunities to challenge for slams this year. After his brilliant win at the ATP finals in London at the end of last season, the question is whether it will be him. The Greek-Australian crowd has once again shown out in force for Tsitsipas.First set: Ashleigh Barty 0-1* Lesia Tsurenko: Quite the cagey start by Barty as the Aussie sprayed a series of errors to immediately fall down 15-40. She saved the first break point with a service winner and the second with an ace, but then a wayward slice error followed by a forehand error hand the Ukrainian the opening break. The rallies are already pretty long, just how Tsurenko likes it.Here is the report on another win for Coco Gauff against Venus Williams.This could be an interesting test for Barty, but it is difficult to tell. Lesia Tsurenko is an extremely capable player who rose to a career high of 23rd last year. She is a counterpuncher with a wicked two-handed backhand (the less said about her forehand, the better) and she should be able force Barty into lengthier rallies while pressing when she can. Her problem is that she has only competed one match since July after a serious right elbow injury ruined much of her 2019 season and it will be difficult to consistently match the world number one.First round matches are always a challenge, and this will be a completely new experience for Barty as she competes at her home slam for the first time as number one, but she arrives in Melbourne filled with confidence after she won her first title on home soil in Adelaide last week.The head to head stands at 2-2, with Tsurenko actually winning the most recent match 6-3 6-2 when they played in Brisbane two years ago. The world number one’s life has dramatically transformed since 2018 when she was still tentatively making her return to the top of the sport. We’ll soon see just how much she has changed.Not a great evening for Australian slam champions so far. Sam Stosur just lost the first set 6-1 to American youngster Caty McNally who is eviscerating the 2011 Wimbledon champion’s serve and playing some vicious attacking tennis. Stosur has famously struggled on home soil and she hasn’t actually won a match in Melbourne since 2015. We’ll see what she can do in the second set.Here is Kevin Mitchell’s report from Melbourne after Dan Evans recovered from two sets down to defeat Mackenzie McDonald and seal his very first slam win as a seeded player. Evans will hope that there is more to come.Hello! Welcome to our coverage of the first night session of the 2020 Australian Open. It has already been a busy day with wins for Naomi Osaka, Serena Williams, Roger Federer, Caroline Wozniacki and more, another victory for Coco Gauff over Venus Williams, one significant upset in 13th seed Denis Shapovalov’s four set loss to Marton Fucsovics and rain washing out most of the day session.But now it is time for the main event as Australia’s Ashleigh Barty finally returns to her home slam as French Open champion and world number one. She will face a difficult first round against Ukraine’s Lesia Tsurenko, whose current ranking of 120, largely thanks to a long injury layoff, belies the fact that she was ranked in the top 25 this time last year. Novak Djokovic will follow her on Rod Laver Arena against Jan-Lennard Struff, another capable opponent. Elsewhere, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Sloane Stephens and Samantha Stosur are also in action. We are all very thankful for those three roofs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43e6112bcbc3e422c792b22df99b740e6d0d5ecf/0_80_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69bf746881566961394335f4e5f2ddab","title":"south africa v england third test day five live","story":"85th over: South Africa 204-9 (Maharaj 51, Paterson 26) Wood comes on. Paterson keeps stepping back to give himself room to work the ball into the off side, but then failing to put bat on ball with his extravagant swings, and Wood doesn’t threaten the stumps. Maiden.84th over: South Africa 204-9 (Maharaj 51, Paterson 26) Curran replaces Root, and South Africa’s final pair keeps swinging. England could have ended it here, as Paterson launched himself on a second run while Maharaj stood still and got caught in no-man’s land, but the throw isn’t firm enough and when it arrives it’s poorly handled.England’s lead is now 86, or just 3.1 Root Over 82s.83rd over: South Africa 195-9 (Maharaj 51, Paterson 21) Maharaj reaches his half-century with a sweep for four. That last Root over was the joint most expensive in the history of Test cricket. Time for a change, captain?81st over: South Africa 162-9 (Maharaj 22, Paterson 17) That’s a fine shot from Paterson, who leans back and smears through the covers for four. 80th over: South Africa 156-9 (Maharaj 22, Paterson 11) Of course I was wrong, Root still had this over to bowl with the old ball. His last delivery of the over heads down leg, spins a little further down leg, flicks off Buttler’s gloves and runs away for four byes. England take the new ball immediately, and give it straight to Bess!79th over: South Africa 149-9 (Maharaj 21, Paterson 9) Paterson leans back and works the ball to backward point. Rood sprints after it, es, and scoops it away from the rope with an inch to spare, which is a commendably honest effort given that England, 144 ahead at that stage with just one wicket still to take, hardly needed to be overly concerned with the odd run here and there.78th over: South Africa 145-9 (Maharaj 20, Paterson 6) A single off the second for Maharaj gives Root four balls against the new man, but Paterson looks entirely untroubled. He proves this by smacking the last straight down the ground for four! That’s Root’s last over with this ball, and it’s followed by some drinks.77th over: South Africa 138-9 (Maharaj 19, Paterson 0) Bess has a go. Slip, leg slip, silly point, short leg. Three dots, and then the wicket. His first ball to Paterson sounds like it hits bat as well as pad, but it lands safe. England are one wicket away now. “Root is going to insist on bowling with the new ball, isn’t he?” asks Bob O’Hara. It may not get that far. Again a change of bowling brings instant reward! Good ball that, which skids through the gate and takes out middle stump!76th over: South Africa 138-8 (Maharaj 19, Nortje 5) Root’s 26th over of the innings. He clusters fielders around the bat, but Maharaj doesn’t give them any exercise.75th over: South Africa 137-8 (Maharaj 19, Nortje 4) Cowabunga! Wood opens the over with a vicious bouncer that rears into Maharaj, who does well to get out of the way. Having done so, he then gets four through point. Then one rears up and flies off the shoulder of the bat but loops wide of silly point and safely to turf!74th over: South Africa 133-8 (Maharaj 15, Nortje 4) Just five overs now before the new ball becomes available, and England will surely take it pretty swiftly. Root’s five-for needs to be nailed in short order, if it is to happen. It certainly doesn’t happen here, and Nortje gets four off the last, tickled down the leg side.73rd over: South Africa 128-8 (Maharaj 15, Nortje 0) Wood also switches angle, moving round the wicket mid-over. On Sky, the commentary team spend most of the over lauding Wood’s character. In 20 years’ time, when his sporting achievements are but a distant memory, he can play that to prospective employersspouses.72nd over: South Africa 128-8 (Maharaj 15, Nortje 0) Root bowls over the wicket to Maharaj, having decided that the angle that brought such success yesterday isn’t cutting much morning mustard. “I’m with Brian Withington,” writes Guy Hornsby. “Those of us of a certain age know that only a fool predicts England Test results but this shelling seems aeons away from the first Test. Pope is obviously a huge bonus, as is Bess, but whatever they’ve had for breakfast, I’m in.”71st over: South Africa 128-8 (Maharaj 15, Nortje 0) As Broad said this morning, “it’s one of those pitches that will offer something every few overs if you put the ball in the right areas”. Maharaj and Rabada look pretty comfortable for a few overs, and then that. Presumably it slowed off the surface, because Rabada had pretty much finished his shot by the time the ball turned up.Wood replaces Broad, and strikes first ball! Rabada chips the ball limply to mid-on, where Broad runs in to take the most straightforward of catches!70th over: South Africa 128-7 (Maharaj 15, Rabada 16) Four more, as Maharaj tonks Root over mid-on, where the fielder watches it sail way over his head on the way to the boundary. And then another boundary, as he works it to backward point where there is no fielder to stop it rolling away.69th over: South Africa 120-7 (Maharaj 7, Rabada 16) Another lovely shot from Rabada, who drives to the long-on boundary for four. Meanwhile the sun is back out in Port Elizabeth, and it’s blue skies ahead (though windy enough for that to change pretty swiftly).68th over: South Africa 115-7 (Maharaj 6, Rabada 12) Another maiden, that Rabada six being the only scoring shot in the last four overs. This is a fine stat:67th over: South Africa 115-7 (Maharaj 6, Rabada 12) Maharaj seems pretty untroubled by whatever Broad can throw at him, at least until the last, which stays low but passes safely under his bat and well wide of the stumps. “Whatever happened to the tour from hell?” wonders Brian Withington. “Whiplash-inducing change in fortune and narrative for the red ball team - how long before canny all-rounder Joe Root is pronounced best ever captain? Rejoice and pass the smelling salts!”66th over: South Africa 115-7 (Maharaj 6, Rabada 12) Bingo! Rabada smashes Root high over long off for six!65th over: South Africa 109-7 (Maharaj 6, Rabada 6) A maiden over from Broad to Maharaj. There were two slips in place this time, but they see no action. 64th over: South Africa 109-7 (Maharaj 6, Rabada 6) Root is indeed bowling himself, and there’s a drop as the ball is edged to the left of Sibley at second slip and he can’t react in time to collect. 63rd over: South Africa 106-7 (Maharaj 5, Rabada 4) The third ball brings the first wicket of the day, and the last the first boundary. It’s off Rabada’s outside edge, but there’s only one slip in place and it goes wide of him and runs away.And so it begins! Well, continues! Philander gets a thick edge onto his front pad, and the ball loops up to Pope, who takes it ing forwards!Right then. The players are out and ready for action. Stuart Broad has the ball in his hands. Let’s (watch other people) do this!England are 18 overs away from a new ball. Root will probably bowl a few of those, in search of his five-for. Perhaps they’ll give Wood two or three overs at the start of the day, before wrapping him up until they get a look at a fresh cherry. “A fine crisp day today in the UK,” writes John Starbuck. “Let’s see if we can crunch our way through the Saffies again, eh? Not often one gets to write that kind of sentence, either.”Stuart Broad has been interviewed by Sky this morning, in blazing sunshine. It’s one of those pitches that will offer something every few overs if you put the ball in the right areas. It was a brilliant toss to win. It’s one of those pitches where if you don’t win the toss you can’t win the game. But for us to get nearly 500 runs and the young players in the team do a lot of the work and stamp their authority on Test cricket is probably the highlight of our trip. There’s a huge amount of talent. We know it can take a bit of time to settle in to Test cricket. The great thing about the young players that I see at the moment is how quickly they’re learning, how quickly they want to learn. It’s great for me, walking into the changing room each day and everyone’s buzzing to be here. It’s a great environment to be in at the moment.Sky’s broadcast commences, with confirmation that it is, for now, cloudy, breezy and dry. Then Nasser Hussain lays into South Africa’s lamentable performance against England’s spin yesterday.Weather update: it looks like we should have a dry morning, at the very least, but would be lucky to have an entirely dry day.England need four wickets. South Africa need one miracle. Welcome to the day five!For the second day in a row play will start with South Africa six wickets down. Yesterday they lost their final four wickets within 24 balls and for the addition of one run. They can only do better today (surely?). Perhaps of more concern to England will be the weather, which as I write this (on Sunday evening UK time) looks potentially, rather than certainly, rainy.

But he has no regrets. He relives his journey from Bugsy Malone to existential Cormac McCarthy playGary Beadle fell in love with Bugsy Malone when he was a boy growing up in Bermondsey, an area south of the Thames with a rough reputation. “We used to sneak into the cinema and watch it,” he remembers. “So we devised a play. We did it in the community hall. I played Fizzy the caretaker. My brother played Tallulah.” He laughs. “Says it all, right? It was art.”Rikki, his older brother, decided to invite the film’s director, Alan Parker. “In those days, you could go through the Yellow Pages and find people. My brother went through every Alan Parker, found his offices, called him, and invited him. He was going to come but he couldn’t because he was a big star. His personal assistant came. She fell in love with myself, my brother and my younger sister.”She recommended the siblings for Anna Scher’s theatre school in Islington. Its alumni list, especially for actors from working-class backgrounds, is long: Kathy Burke and Dexter Fletcher in its earlier days, Daniel Kaluuya and Adam Deacon more recently. “Anna Scher had a waiting list of four years but we were fast-tracked by this PA who said, ‘You’ve got to take these kids from the street. If you don’t take them in, you’re going to lose them.’”Beadle has been working steadily ever since, and Rikki Beadle-Blair, now an acclaimed director, never misses a performance. “Rikki is my idol,” says Beadle. “He’s the genius of the family, the whole reason I’m an actor.”Beadle, who taught himself to read and write “quite late”, says he “never had that proper education. But what I did have was freedom of expression. I could be what I wanted and so could my brother.” He grins. “My brother’s as camp as Christmas. Never was in the closet. He was who he was. He was born that way. We were lucky. We lived in a really rough part of south-east London, but we created this bubble, and I think being taken to museums and art exhibitions by really cool, hippy teachers, who just wanted to do their bit, was the best thing.”We are in the foyer of the newly opened Boulevard theatre in Soho, London. Beadle is in rehearsals for Terry Johnson’s production of The Sunset Limited, a tense two-hander by the novelist Cormac McCarthy. The premise is simple: two men, known only as White and Black, meet on a New York subway platform and begin to talk. “It’s very quick, sharp, witty,” says Beadle. “A meeting of minds, philosophies and beliefs. But it’s laced with humour, pace and emotional journeys. And little rabbit holes where you’re like, ‘Whoa, we’re going here?’ Then – bang – it all makes sense. More than anything, it’s funny. But, essentially, it’s about spirituality versus intellect.”It took Beadle many years to call himself an actor. “I’d deny it. I never ever said I was an actor. Where I come from, to be an actor meant you were a bit soft. You’re supposed to be a plumber, a brickie, work on the docks or something. When I got to 15, 16, and I had to make a decision, I was still in denial. I thought the best I could be was a cinema manager. I swear to God.”He takes a rare pause. “There’s a romance about this business, it can break your heart. There’s times where I was like, ‘Oh my God, I’ve been doing this most of my life, but I don’t think I can act. I’ve been lying to myself all along.’ So I had to reinvent myself. And I did that through theatre, which is where I started.”For those of us who saw him on EastEnders, the differences between Beadle and his old character, Paul Trueman, are striking. While Trueman was the cunning bad boy of Albert Square who kept his cards close to his chest, Beadle is friendly, funny and candid. It’s rare to meet someone who speaks so quickly but never stumbles, and his many tangents always come back around. EastEnders was Beadle’s longest gig, lasting more than three and a half years. He hasn’t looked back.“When I walked away from EastEnders, they weren’t happy about it but I wanted to move on.” The challenge that comes after leaving such a high-profile job appealed to him. “The test was, ‘Can you do EastEnders and then work again afterwards?’ Apparently, everyone who does it never works again. I liked the odds on that. I thought, ‘Let’s see if I can pull it off.’” Since he left in 2004, Beadle has worked at the National, Almeida and Royal Court theatres, and had roles on various TV dramas including Patrick Melrose. Recently, he has been filming for Small Axe, Steve McQueen’s TV series set in London’s Caribbean community from the late 60s to the early 80s.Beadle has always acted, but music nearly tempted him away. He discovered hip-hop while working in New York and began making instrumentals and writing lyrics with a friend when he returned to the UK. They were called the City Limits Crew and even supported Run-DMC on tour. “It got to a point where I had to make a decision and say, ‘Look, I’m going to leave this and just do my acting.’” Music remains a big part of his life, though. “I don’t know if you know a band called WSTRN?” he asks. I have – they won a Mobo for best newcomer in 2016. “Louis Rei,” he says, referring to one of the band members. “That’s my son. I’m proud of him, but I can’t cramp his style, baby. I just watch from afar and think, ‘God, that’s what I wanted to do.’”He trails off. “All musos want to be actors and all actors want to be musos.” Would he do music again? Or a musical? “No, I can’t sing, babes. I’ll be honest with you, I don’t want to be in the back harmonising. What’s the point? Solo or nothing. It sounds really up my own hole, but it’s true. I want to be the best. No? OK then, I’ll just watch other people.”Is that why he stuck with acting? He felt like he could be the best? “I try, darling. There’s a chance.”• The Sunset Limited is at the Boulevard theatre, London, until 29 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b83043b2dd0e48cf7106ba7d97c6fcb631d42e96/0_378_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fefa649c14d7a1680bd31aa2889ce3f","title":"affordable cheap yoga hiking walking wellness holiday france french alps","story":"The hostel might be basic on this wellness holiday near Chamonix but the stunning scenery, hikes and yoga more than compensateWe walk along the river in single file, paying attention to the sight of the mountains and the trees, the sound of the water and the birds, and the feel of the sun on our skin. When we reach a clearing, we stop to do some silent sun salutations, then sit cross-legged in a circle to share our feelings.Cringe! I love fresh air and exercise, but I don’t need to talk about it with a bunch of strangers afterwards. Luckily, at that moment a huge pair of curved horns emerge from behind a fallen tree, followed by their owner, a mighty bouquetin (alpine ibex). We are so transfixed by this shaggy beast that by the time he wanders off again, our “sharing circle” has been forgotten.I’m on a yoga and hiking break in the French Alps, one of a new collection of summer wellness holidays by UCPA, a French non-profit organisation that runs affordable, active holidays for adults under 45s (though they don’t check!). UCPA is best-known for its ski trips, but also offers summer activities including surfing, kayaking and mountain biking. The new wellness breaks are more relaxed than these high-octane trips – and are extremely good value compared with the average pricey yoga retreat.The low prices mean few frills. We are staying at UCPA Argentière, a 292-bed hostel in a village near Chamonix. Most rooms are four- to six-person dorms, but my sister and I bag one of the twins. Accommodation is basic – guests make their own beds and clean their room before checkout, and bathrooms are shared – but it is modern the hostel was refurbished a few years ago. It is certainly not a luxury retreat, but makes a great base for a healthy holiday.Most days involve a few hours’ hiking and a two-hour yoga class. There’s an outdoor pool at the hostel, although this gets busy in the afternoon when everyone returns from their activities – there are a dozen different trips running concurrently each week. We are a group of five women (two English, two French and one Belgian) plus our walking guide, Fabienne, and yoga teacher, Samantha.Our first walk follows trails around Argentière. We set off along the Petit Balcon Nord, a path that runs along the valley through pine trees, with wonderful views of meadows and mountains. Fabienne is a particularly engaging guide, stopping frequently to help us spot flowers, birds and alpine marmots, cute rodents that whistle when they spot predators before dashing into their burrows. It’s more of a nature walk than a strenuous trek hardened hikers might prefer one of UCPA’s dedicated trekking or trail-running trips. Basic French is also an advantage – Fabienne doesn’t speak much English, but makes a real effort to speak slowly and simply for our benefit.At Le Lavancher, a ludicrously pretty alpine hamlet, we turn uphill, ascending steadily until we reach a viewpoint. We eat our packed lunches overlooking the Mer de Glace, France’s biggest glacier, on the northern slopes of the Mont Blanc massif. After coffee at Buvette du Chapeau, a tiny mountain refuge with a terrace for soaking up the views, it’s time to head back to the hostel for our first yoga class.Samantha speaks rapid-fire French throughout our hatha class that I find impossible to follow – occasionally looking up to see that I’m in a completely different pose from everyone else. Later, a UCPA representative assures me that all guides are bilingual and classes are in English too, so maybe we are just unlucky. (My sister’s language skills are better than mine I really should brush up on my schoolgirl French.) I may have missed the nuances of the class, but I still benefit from a good stretch after our walk.The cost of the holiday includes a pass for local buses, trains and ski lifts, so we can hike in different beauty spots. We had hoped to trek around two mountain lakes, Lac Bleu and Lac Blanc in the Aiguilles Rouges, but in mid-June the routes were still snowbound. (Wellness breaks run from June to September.)Instead, we take a bus to nearby Vallorcine, then ride a gondola and a chairlift up the mountain for a circular hike with far-reaching views across snowy peaks. There’s a decent amount of snow here, too – Fabienne teaches us the best technique for running down a snowy slope without falling over. Another day we take a short train ride over the border to Switzerland, for that riverside meditation walk. The route includes an impressive waterfall, lunch in a wildflower meadow and a paddle in the icy river.On a rainy day, we scrap the hike and get a bus into Chamonix and take a cable car to the top of the Aiguille du Midi (3,842 metres) – the closest you can get to the summit of Mont Blanc without climbing. When we reach the terraces at the top, the clouds briefly part in time for us to Step Into the Void – the all-glass box that juts out over the abyss, with thousands of metres of empty space beneath. Afterwards, my sister and I calm our nerves with a few drinks on rue des Moulins in Chamonix old town.The yoga classes cover different styles including hatha, faster vinyasa flow and relaxing yin, which was my favourite. Most sessions take place in a room inside the hostel, but the yin was under a canopy in the garden and its slower pace made it easier for me to follow. On the last day, we swap the yoga for a real treat: an afternoon in a spa. The Deep Nature spa at Les Granges d’en Haut in Les Houches, the other side of Chamonix, must be one of the most spectacularly sited in Europe: the Jacuzzi and a deeper, non-bubbly wooden Swedish bath have panoramic views over the Mont Blanc range. Inside there is a pool, sauna and hammam. This is the one luxurious element of our trip, and it’s a fantastic way to round off the week.Mealtimes, by contrast, are more like school dinners, in a sociable, serve-yourself canteen setting – but are filling and relatively healthy. Bircher muesli for breakfast, do-it-yourself packed lunches (cheese baguettes, tuna and egg salads), buffet dinners (the tastiest dishes tend to be the vegetarian options, such as spicy chickpeas or tomatoey lentils), with desserts every day and, this being France, at least four delicious cheeses. In the evenings, we head out to Argentière’s handful of bars to sample herbal génépi, bitter gentiane and half-a dozen varieties of kir.At the end of the trip, Fabienne invites us for a farewell drink and asks for our feedback. As we talk about our favourite moments, I realise I haven’t dodged the sharing circle after all – but I’m too chilled out to care. • The trip was provided by Action Outdoors, the UK arm of UCPA, whose six-night wellness breaks cost from £370 (18-25s)£470 (26-45s) including full-board, guides, lift passes and equipment, and run from 14 June to late September.

The trove was then shared with the ICIJ.Dos Santos and her husband, the businessman and art collector Sindika Dokolo, say computers belonging to their employees and legal advisers were hacked. They say they are the subjects of a politically motivated witch-hunt led by Angola’s new president. Through their lawyers, they rejected any allegation of wrongdoing, and vehemently denied being financed by state money. “There is an orchestrated attack by the current government that is completely politically motivated, it’s completely unfounded,” Dos Santos told BBC News. “I can say my holdings are commercial, there are no proceeds from contracts or public contracts or money that has been deviated from other funds.”Dokolo described the government actions as “armageddon” and a risk to the economy. The couple say their businesses employ thousands of people in Angola and are among the country’s biggest tax contributors. “We have worked and invested in this country, more than many others,” he said.In an open letter, José Eduardo dos Santos rejected allegations of wrongdoing, saying he had “not transferred to himself, or to any other entity, money from the state”.After a seven-month-investigation, the , working alongside outlets including the BBC, the New York Times and Portugal’s Expresso newspaper, has uncovered documents that raise questions over preferential deals and lucrative transactions with the Angolan state worth hundreds of millions of dollars.The material reveals an opaque network of about 400 companies, many of them offshore, connected to Dos Santos, Dokolo and their associates, and the assistance given to the couple in managing them by a coterie of European and American management consultants, accountants and lawyers.The documents appear to suggest that:• The state oil company Sonangol sold Dokolo what has become the couple’s most valuable asset: a stake in the Portuguese oil corporation Galp, now worth €750m after an initial loan-backed payment of just €11m.• A total of $115m in payments to consultancy firms, ordered while Dos Santos was chair of the state oil company, were routed through a Dubai company controlled by her associates.• A business venture with the state diamond company allegedly resulted in $200m of public debt propping up an ailing Swiss jewellery brand partly owned by Dokolo.• Two Dos Santos companies and their subcontractors stood to collect up to $500m in fees from a Dubai-style real estate development in the Angolan capital, Luanda, that was later cancelled by the new president for “over-invoicing” and “disproportionate compensation”.Three weeks ago, Angola’s attorney general announced a freeze on the assets of Dos Santos, Dokolo and their chief adviser, alleging that their dealings with the country’s publicly owned oil and diamond companies had “harmed” the state to the tune of $1bn.Angolan prosecutors launched a criminal investigation into her actions while at the helm of the state oil company, Sonangol, in September. They are working with counterparts in the UK, Portugal, Switzerland, the US and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to trace assets, prevent money transfers and gather information.Dos Santos says she is the subject of a witch-hunt by Angola’s government, designed to neutralise her as a potential political opponent. On Wednesday, she provoked speculation about a bid for the presidency, telling a TV interviewer it was “possible” she would run for office.However, Dos Santos has not visited Angola for more than a year. A prosecutor told the Portuguese newspaper Expresso she was thought to have left the country hours after receiving a request from prosecutors to appear for questioning in July 2018. Through her lawyers, Dos Santos said she had “no record of having received any such request”, and that there was no question of her having refused to meet prosecutors.Dos Santos and her half-brothers and sisters are among the most prominent members of the oligarchy of powerful families in Angola. Her father came to office in 1979 as head of the People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). After the end of the civil war in 2002, President Dos Santos and the MPLA consolidated power by bringing the most valuable sectors of the economy into government ownership.The spoils were shared with a select group with links to politics and the military. As a result, Africa’s second-largest oil producing nation became known as one of the most corrupt countries on Earth, ranking near the bottom of the Transparency International corruption perceptions index. “These are the classic symptoms of a captured state,” said Steve Goodrich, a senior research manager at Transparency International UK, after reviewing the Luanda Leaks findings. “Here we have industry and politics all in one family, with no apparent separation of powers.”The leak includes data from Fidequity, a team of advisers who acted as a family office for the couple, administering their empire from plush premises above a Louis Vuitton salesroom in Lisbon.As the couple grew richer, emails and board minutes show the number of banks prepared to have them as clients dwindled. The data indicates that top-tier lenders severed ties after the Dos Santos regime was ruled a corruption risk by compliance departments.Company service providers in the Netherlands and the Isle of Man also turned down their business, the files suggest. Dokolo says he has been unable to open bank accounts under his own name in London and Paris since 2001.Other European companies appear to have taken a different approach, helping the couple move money and win lucrative contracts from the Angolan state. The blue chip firms PwC and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) collected millions in fees, providing services such as auditing of accounts and management consultancy.PwC, which handled auditing and accounts for Dokolo companies in Malta, Switzerland and the Netherlands, said it had opened an internal investigation “in response to the very serious and concerning allegations” and “taken action to terminate any ongoing work for entities controlled by members of the Dos Santos family”.BCG said senior partners conducted regular reviews. “We are proud of and take responsibility for our work, and are strict in adhering to our policies and values,” a spokesperson said.Since taking over the leadership of the country and its ruling party, with the blessing of José Eduardo dos Santos, the new president, João Lourenço, has vowed to fight the “cancer of corruption”. The most high-profile targets of his anti-graft drive have been the children of his predecessor.Isabel dos Santos’s half-brother, José Filomeno dos Santos, is on trial for the attempted looting of $500m from the country’s sovereign wealth fund. He has pleaded not guilty. Her half-sister, Welwitschia dos Santos, a member of parliament, was impeached last year after moving to Britain. She fled after alleging she had been threatened by the Angolan secret service.Dos Santos, however, is fighting back. In recent weeks, she has toured media outlets giving interviews, saying her wealth is the result of hard work and business acumen. Her husband has opened an arbitration dispute in London against the state diamond company, and says he is involved in a second arbitration over Galp in the Netherlands.The Netherlands dispute centres on a loan from the state oil company, Sonangol, which sold part of its shareholding in Galp to a vehicle controlled by Dokolo in 2006. The agreed price was €75m, with Dokolo’s company making an upfront payment of €11.2m and committing to pay the rest at a later date from idends. If the whole amount had not been repaid by 31 December 2017, in euros, Dokolo’s vehicle risked losing the shares.While Dos Santos was chair of Sonangol, it agreed to let Dokolo’s vehicle make the repayment in Angola’s volatile currency, the kwanza. After Dos Santos was sacked from the state oil company, its new managers cancelled the deal and sent the money back. Sonangol is now demanding compensation.Dokolo denies the deal was a preferential one, and said there was “absolutely no wrongdoing”. Through his lawyers, he said that it had been approved after an internal review at Sonangol, and that the state oil company’s purchase of a shareholding in Galp, one of its most successful investments, was originally his wife’s idea and had been negotiated by him.Dokolo said he invested $115m in equity in the Swiss jeweller that his commitment matched that of the state diamond company and that the business “steadily improved” under his ownership.Dos Santos said under her leadership, Sonangol spent far less on consultants than previously. Her lawyers said the Dubai company that handled Sonangol’s payments to consultancy firms was a lead contractor with a formal contract approved by the board of directors, and was not owned by Dos Santos.Challenged about how she has apparently benefited from her father’s decrees, Dos Santos said the president’s role was to ratify government concessions and licences, and that it would be hard to do business in Angola without ever having a decree relating to one of her companies. Her lawyers added that the prices agreed with her companies for the proposed redevelopment of Luanda were competitive, and that the allegations of overcharging were “false and unfounded”.In a sign that the international community is beginning to close ranks against Dos Santos, her name has been removed from a list of participants preparing to meet in Davos this week for the World Economic Forum’s annual gathering of business and political leaders. Her company Unitel had paid to be a sponsor. The event’s organisers said they were “re-evaluating” Unitel’s participation.Additional reporting by Caelainn Barr."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/910ac103bf8120d1eacdc726e0e610683b6ac0be/0_174_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2f6e8b671f9d3531888894e5cde0c25","title":"two popes plotting cardinals francis benedict celibacy rules","story":"Benedict and his inner circle are accused of intervening to halt Pope Francis relaxing celibacy rules as the battle between conservative and liberal factions takes a new twistThe pilgrims filing into the papal audience hall last Wednesday were mostly oblivious to the saga enveloping the Vatican over an explosive new book that pits the retired Pope Benedict XVI against the reigning Pope Francis. But they were clear on who their favourite is.“I would not have come all this way for Benedict,” said Marisol Durán Vergora, a first-time visitor to the Vatican from Spain. “He is an extremist, whereas Francis is more human and closer to the people.” Another pilgrim, who wished to remain anonymous, speculated after being briefed on the goings-on: “Benedict decided to abdicate and should keep his promise of staying silent.”The ex-pontiff, who chose to be called Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI after his abdication in 2013, instead of reverting to Joseph Ratzinger, is at the centre of a drama that has been more entertaining than the Oscar-nominated film, The Two Popes. It started with a book written with the outspoken conservative cardinal Robert Sarah defending priestly celibacy. That in itself would not have caused a stir. But the timing of the book’s release, as Pope Francis considers allowing the ordination of married men in remote areas of the Amazon in order to overcome a shortage of priests, led many to accuse Benedict, who still lives within the walls of Vatican City and continues to wear a white cassock, of breaching his vow of silence and undermining his successor’s authority.In a bizarre twist, after extracts of From the Depths of Our Hearts were published in France’s Le Figaro newspaper last Sunday, the former pontiff demanded that his name be dropped as co-author. His personal secretary, Georg Gänswein, said that while Benedict knew that Cardinal Sarah, who has clashed with Pope Francis in the past, was preparing a book, and had sent him an essay on the priesthood, he had not approved a co-authored project and had neither seen nor authorised the book’s cover.Sarah denied allegations that he had misled Benedict, providing proof of the text that had been given to him and claiming that Benedict was aware that the project would take the form of a book.The French publisher, Fayard, went ahead and published the book as planned, but in future editions Benedict will be named as a contributor rather than co-author. Meanwhile, the US publisher, Ignatius, refused to relent, saying in a statement that the English version would retain Benedict as co-author.Amid the fallout over the book, Vatican commentators picked over its origins, with some saying “the two popes” were the victims of exploitation by the warring conservative and liberal factions within the Catholic church. Throughout his life Benedict has been a prolific writer, but others questioned his capacity to construct such a detailed essay at the age of 92. A Vatican journalist for the rightwing Italian press claimed that it was a furious Pope Francis who ordered that Benedict’s name be removed.Benedict has come forward on a variety of issues over the past seven years, most controversially writing last year that the sexual revolution of the 1960s and “homosexual cliques” among priests were to blame for the church’s paedophile-priest scandals. The opinion came two months after an unprecedented Vatican summit on tackling clerical sexual abuse, and sharply contrasted with that of Francis, who blamed the scandals on a clerical culture that elevates priests above the laity. Benedict also wrote a letter complimenting Cardinal Joachim Meisner – a fierce critic of Francis who spoke out against the pontiff allowing remarried orcees to receive holy communion – who died in 2017.But this is the first time he has intervened, whether knowingly or not, in a matter that the Pope is actively considering. Francis is weeks away from publishing his decision on the Amazon after a document approved by bishops at a synod in October noted that people of Catholic faith in the region have “enormous difficulties” in receiving communion and seeing a priest. If Francis supports the request to ordain married men, it would apply only to those already serving as deacons. The pontiff himself has consistently said that he would never change the centuries-old requirement for celibacy, but critics fear that the Amazon could set a precedent.“In all the times that Benedict has intervened, what he has written is coherent with what he thinks, so this doesn’t surprise me,” said Iacopo Scaramuzzi, a Vatican journalist and author of the book Tango Vaticano. La Chiesa al Tempo di Francesco (‘Vatican Tango. The Church in the Time of Francis’). “They say he may have been manipulated by his entourage, but he was the one who chose his entourage.”The person at the centre of his inner circle is Gänswein, a German archbishop whose dashing looks have earned him the nickname Gorgeous Georg. “I don’t doubt that in all of this drama Gänswein had a role,” added Scaramuzzi. “He is also very conservative and is among the Pope’s opponents.”Robert Mickens, the Rome-based editor of the English-language edition of the Catholic newspaper La Croix, said that Benedict had never dissociated himself from “the minions” who use him.“From the beginning, supporters of the more traditional wing of the church who were not happy that he resigned have tugged at him to keep his voice in the game,” added Mickens. “And he has worryingly gone along with this. We’re in this situation because he did not keep his promise to be quiet.”The Two Popes is a fictionalised depiction of a bromance between Benedict and Francis despite their different ideas, with, in the final scene of the film, the pair eating pizza and drinking beer as they watch Germany play Argentina in the World Cup final. In real life, it is unlikely the two are so chummy, but most experts agree that the relationship, at least until now, has been cordial, with Francis acting graciously in the face of opposition.Joshua McElwee, the Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, said Benedict’s comments on celibacy could scupper the potential move in the Amazon and leave many questions unanswered, especially over how the role of Pope Emeritus would continue.Among those in the queue for a papal audience was Alex Flood, a protestant minister from the US who was in Rome to do research on Catholicism. “I know very little about the politics of the Catholic church but from our perspective, celibacy should be a choice and not beholden to tradition,” he said. “When I speak to Catholics they recognise this, but it’s such an old tradition that the change is uncomfortable.”Flood described the scandal over the book as a “dog-and-pony show that is missing the needs of people”.“It’s akin to watching American politics,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4b655d21bf33073746d8969ebd09998f00cc8d6/0_70_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=670d410dc6bda39d609d4d2ac13727d4","title":"coronavirus spreads to beijing as china confirms new cases","story":"Authorities on alert ahead of lunar new year holiday as 139 new cases of strain detectedA mysterious Sars-like virus has spread around China – including to Beijing – fuelling anxiety of a major outbreak in the country as millions begin travelling for the lunar new year.Authorities reported 139 new cases of the new strain of coronavirus over the weekend, more than doubling the total number of infected patients since the virus was first detected last month in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.Three people have died, and at least three cases have been reported overseas: two in Thailand and one in Japan. On Monday, media in South Korea said a woman who had travelled from China had also tested positive.Cases have been detected in Beijing, Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces, Chinese authorities said on Monday, heightening fears ahead of the lunar new year holiday, when more than 400 million Chinese citizens are expected to travel domestically and internationally.The strain has caused alarm because of its connection to severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-03.China’s National Health Commission said it had sent working groups to all provinces to oversee outbreak prevention, describing the situation as “controllable”. Hospitals in Shanghai and Beijing and in Zhejiang province have “comprehensively” strengthened examination procedures in hospitals. In Shenzhen, temperature checks have been put in place in airports, ports and railway stations.More than 100 patients with symptoms were waiting to be seen at the Xiehe hospital in Wuhan since 6am on Monday, according to a hospital worker. “If you are coming now, you have to wait between three and four hours before you can see the doctors,” a hospital worker said by phone.At a hospital in Chaoyang district in Beijing, patients were being given masks and forms to fill out, detailing any recent travel to Wuhan. A nurse said preventive measures were also being taken to protect doctors but declined to give more details.Coronaviruses are transmitted between animals and people and the outbreak in Wuhan has been linked to a now-closed seafood market where live animals were reportedly sold.Authorities have said there is no clear evidence the virus has been spread through human to human contact. Researchers worry the number of infections has been severely underestimated.Xi Chen, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Public Health, said the likelihood of human to human transmission was large given how many cases were confirmed. “It’s hard to see all these cases coming from animals at the same market,” Chen said.For weeks, the only reported cases were in Wuhan and areas outside mainland China, prompting many people to question whether other cities were simply not reporting or testing for the virus. Some internet users joked the virus appeared to be “patriotic” by only spreading beyond China’s borders.Chen said the high cost of testing for diagnosis may have contributed to underreporting. Authorities have still not identified the source of the infection, which further complicates the government’s ability to contain the outbreak. The Huanan seafood market, where thousands of traders sold products, has been closed since 1 January. But some of the detected cases are patients with no history of visiting the market.“What concerns me is the source of infection. We have no idea. That’s the most important thing. Without knowing that we don’t know the harm, how hard it can be,” Chen said.Others fear that authorities have not moved quickly enough to contain the spread of the virus or educate the public. In Wuhan, temperature checkpoints have been installed at the airport and at train stations and bus terminals since 14 January, about five weeks after the virus was first detected.Observers and residents worry about the possibility of a cover-up, worsening the outbreak, as was the case with Sars in 2003.Some residents in Wuhan have been told not to speak to media. The official Weibo account of Wuhan police said on 1 January that eight internet users who spread false information online “causing adverse social impacts” had been dealt with “according to the law”.But Chinese health officials have made improvements since the Sars episode. In response to a bird flu outbreak in 2013, authorities quickly worked with the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fresh food markets were shut down but the outbreak was exacerbated by poultry sales into smaller, less-regulated markets.The situation is complicated by the fact that farmers are unlikely to be compensated by the government or to give up their sick animals. “It’s not about a cover-up. Rather it’s about a lack of capacity and about a lack of enforced regulation,” said Nicholas Thomas, associate professor focusing on health security at City University of Hong Kong.“At the moment, it is a bad flu. Yes, it is something to be concerned about and it is probably going to get worse in terms of infections and mortality, but again it’s winter,” he said. “It is likely to spread but we are still a long way off the levels of Sars or bird flu.”The state-run Global Times said in an editorial on Sunday: “In the early days of Sars, there was a cover-up and delayed reporting. Such things can never be repeated again in China.”Authorities have advised residents in the run-up to the lunar new year, which falls on 25 January, to be on the lookout for symptoms including fever, coughs, breathing difficulties and pneumonia. Millions of people will crisscross the country during a weeklong public holiday starting on 24 January, in what is known as humanity’s largest migration. Some of those travelling will have set off already.The WHO has not recommended any travel restrictions and Chinese authorities have not yet issued any. Still, not all residents were comforted by government assurances.“With this huge amount of spring festival travel, why are there not any prevention measures?” one wrote on Weibo. On the Douban forum, another observed that few people at the Wuhan train station were wearing masks. “The group appears calm, and there may be many reasons … including the failure of government to fully inform people,” the user said.Traders at the suspected seafood market in Wuhan said they were not overly worried about the virus, seeing it as little more than the common cold during the winter. “We start early, at 2am or 3am. We put our hands in the cold water. If we catch a cold, we don’t pay it much attention,” said Li, 52, who has operated a stall in Huanan for most of the past decade.Li said that starting from late December, the property developer that owned the market asked renters to wear masks to work and avoid going to crowded places. “I’m not worried,” said Li. “My grandchildren all live in Wuhan and we don’t believe it. It’s just rumours.”However, Li said some tenants who might have shown symptoms of the virus were unlikely to have reported themselves, fearing the impact on their business and being quarantined. “Most people wouldn’t say if they had it,” he said.Additional reporting by Lillian Yang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13d80d8d651fa67367cbd50ba2376d7fce3c5852/0_302_4899_2941/master/4899.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b8c80740ba6981fcb7dc07a3c481315","title":"english journalist trapped in ireland over extradition bid","story":"Dublin court to consider European arrest warrant for Ian Bailey over unsolved murder of French womanIan Bailey, an English journalist-turned poet, has said he is trapped in Ireland because of an attempt to extradite him to France where he faces 25 years in jail for allegedly murdering a French film-maker, Sophie Toscan du Plantier.A high court in Dublin will hold a hearing on Monday into a European arrest warrant issued by a Paris court, the latest twist in a legal saga over Ireland’s most notorious unsolved murder.Du Plantier was bludgeoned to death outside her holiday home in rural west Cork on 23 December 1996.Bailey, 62, who lives a few miles from the murder scene, denies any involvement and said he was a victim of persecution by blinkered authorities who let the real murderer slip away. “I never murdered anyone,” he said in an interview.Irish prosecutors long ago decided there was insufficient evidence to press charges, leaving Bailey a free man in Ireland, but last year a French court convicted him in absentia and launched an extradition attempt – the third by French authorities.“I’m technically trapped in Ireland,” said Bailey. “Unless I travel in handcuffs or in a coffin I’m curtailed.”He was arrested, bailed and forced to surrender his passport last month when the court endorsed the warrant.Bailey’s legal team will fight the extradition attempt, said his solicitor, Frank Buttimer. “We are required to file submissions in response to the application to seek his removal. We’ll be dealing with that matter in court.”The hearing will be closely watched in France, where du Plantier’s family has waged a high-profile campaign for Bailey’s extradition. “What the family wish to see is a new trial where he is present and is legally represented on an equitable basis,” Alain Spilliaert, a lawyer who represents the family, told reporters last month.Speaking during a recent visit to Dublin, Bailey said the prospect of dying in a French prison was affecting his health. “Recently I started to shudder and judder and shake. I’d never experienced anything like it. I’m really suffering physically and psychologically from this thing.”Bailey grew up in Gloucestershire and worked as a freelance journalist in the 1980s, filing stories to the Sunday Times, before moving to west Cork, a bucolic Atlantic region known as the Irish riviera. It is popular with artists, bohemians and foreigners.Bailey initially filed newspaper articles on du Plantier’s murder until becoming the prime suspect, a label that stuck, leaving him in limbo.“It’s a Kafkaesque nightmare – the journalist goes to investigate the murder and becomes the suspect,” said the film director Jim Sheridan, who is making a documentary about the case. Sheridan has amassed more than 400 hours of footage over five years. “The difficulty is where do you stop the story? It’s ongoing.”Sheridan said Bailey inhabited a nexus of celebrity and notoriety similar to that of OJ Simpson. In Ireland public opinion seemed to be tilting towards him but the French remained convinced of his guilt, said the director.Bailey, who ekes a living selling poetry and pizzas, said he was a reluctant celebrity and tried to psychologically “bubble wrap” himself.Some Irish detectives who investigated the murder were convinced of Bailey’s guilt. He had cuts on his face and hands, a record of violence against his Welsh partner, Jules Thomas, and admitted to having left their cottage – to go to an adjacent shed to write an article, he said – on the night of the murder.But there was no forensic evidence, other evidence went missing and a key witness retracted testimony, saying police improperly pressured her. After Irish prosecutors declined to press charges French authorities took up the case. Under French law a person suspected of murdering a French citizen in another jurisdiction can be tried in France.Last May the victim’s son, Pierre-Louis Baudey-Vignaud, visited Cork and from a church pulpit urged witnesses to attend the trialurged witnesses to testify at the French trial, saying his mother was not a ghost. “She is the victim of human cruelty and violence which has no place here.”The family called the verdict a victory for truth and justice. Bailey’s lawyer, Buttimer, called it a sham.The former journalist said he channelled the pressure into creativity. “No part of me enjoys being tortured but I’ve learned to get something out of it – poetry, singing, carving.”Bailey recently published a second book of poems with titles such as A Thousand Arrows, Cell by Date and Bonfire that allude to his situation. He hopes to record the poems as audio books and is due to give a public reading next month. “I’m hoping to give the performance of my lifetime.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e632d45b3e5f79a51800b19498303322110499c/0_128_1424_854/master/1424.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f1bffab694cca5d00679a904b184494","title":"monday briefing harrys great sadness at stepping away","story":"Prince breaks silence on decision to end royal duties … end to cervical cancer in sight … massive dust storm hits Australia Good morning and welcome to this first briefing of the week with me, Alison Rourke.Prince Harry has broken his silence on stepping away from royal duties, saying he and his wife, Meghan, would continue to “lead a life of service” but had “no other option”.

The disease kills 850 women each year in the UK. From the beginning of December, routine screening has been reoriented to test primarily for HPV. Only those who have the virus will have their smear sample checked for abnormal cells that are the precursor of cervical cancer. “Combined with the success of the HPV vaccine for both boys and girls, we hope that cervical cancer can be eliminated altogether by the NHS in England,” said Prof Peter Johnson, the national clinical director for cancer.Luanda leaks – A seven-month investigation has revealed for the first time the complex financial schemes that have helped Africa’s richest woman – Angola’s Isabel dos Santos – amass a fortune at vast cost to her country. A huge leak of confidential documents raise questions over preferential deals and lucrative transactions with the Angolan state worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Dos Santos is known as “the princess” in Angola and is the daughter of former president José Eduardo dos Santos. The material reveals an opaque network of about 400 companies, many of them offshore, connected to Dos Santos and her husband, the businessman and art collector Sindika Dokolo, and their associates. The couple has rejected any allegation of wrongdoing and vehemently denied being financed by state money. They say they are the subjects of a politically motivated witch-hunt led by Angola’s new president.BBC payout – The former Today program presenter Sarah Montague has won £400,000 in a settlement over “unequal treatment”. Montague, 53, who previously presented alongside Today’s veteran journalist John Humphrys, said the deal came after a “long period of stressful negotiations” which was triggered after discovering a disparity in her pay and conditions. “Last year, after a long period of stressful negotiation, I accepted a settlement of £400,000 subject to tax and an apology from the BBC for paying me unequally for so many years,” Montague tweeted.Guantánamo torture – The two psychologists who designed the US “enhanced interrogation” program at Guantánamo Bay that included waterboarding and other forms of torture, will give evidence in open court for the first time this week.

Photogragh: iStockToday (Monday) at 5.15pm marks closure of the Central Applications Office (CAO) discounted online applications process, while the normal closing date for applications is February 1st.This is just to register with the CAO there’ still plenty of time to select a course. In fact, you can alter your choices until July 1st in most cases.However, some programmes require earlier applications. For example, people applying for “restricted application” courses (which include early assessments such as interviews or portfolio assessment) must list any such course on their CAO application by February 1st.Following these assessments, applicants will learn if they are approved for consideration for a place on each programme. Marks are awarded in many cases, which are added to an applicant’s CAO points score in August, to determine offers of places.Hpat testThere are also key dates you need to remember if applying to any of the five Irish undergraduate medical schools.In addition to registering with the CAO, you need to register with Hpat Ireland – Health Professions Admission Test – by January 20th at 5.15pm to avail of its €140 fee. (Otherwise you risk paying a late registration fee, €210, until February 1st, with an exceptional late fee of €245 until February 3rd). These Hpat tests take place in centres countrywide on Saturday, February 22nd .In addition, mature applicants for nursing, as well as making their CAO application before February 1st at 5.15pm, must sit a separate assessment test.To do this you need to register with publicjobs.ie and submit the relevant online application form between February 3rd and 21st at 3pm. The test is carried out by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Nursing and Midwifery Board (see the CAO handbook online for more).Broaden your horizonsRemember the CAO application process is just one of many opportunities on offer.For the current Leaving Cert class of 2020, the nightmare scenario in mid-August is to find yourself with no satisfactory offer from the CAO and with no other options in place. Now is the time to ensure that does not happen.For example, let’s say you’re a student based in Tuam, Co Galway, and are considering applying for a place in accounting at NUI Galway, which required 486 points in 2019.You would be wise to look at an excellent degree in accounting offered in GMIT Castlebar which required 253 points last year.Also, consider applying for the two-year highly regarded accounting technician apprenticeship which is a two-year level-six course. (see accountingtechnicianapprenticeship.ie for more details).It involves spending one day a week in college and the remainder of the working week in an accounting firm. Significantly, you are paid for the duration of the apprenticeship and it also provides a route to study through other professional bodies such as Chartered Accountants Ireland.You might consider a general business degree instead, or apply for a one-year FET (further education and trainnig) level-five accounting course, available from your local Education and Training Board college).The key is to keep your options open: if you do, you can be almost certain of progressing into a career of your choice.Think outside the boxFinally, given the high entry requirements for many programmes, any student seeking a place on a high-demand course should look at the opportunities to study in a European university. Up to 1,000 programmes are taught exclusively through English.I spoke recently to three Irish students who are studying physiotherapy in two Dutch universities, where there are more than 20 Irish students in both their class group.Admission requires two H4s and four passes in the Leaving Cert. Fees are lower that in Ireland, with the highest charge being €2,143 per year in the Netherlands. Living costs are between €400-€500 per month. Information on all EU programmes is available online (www.eunicas.ie).Whatever option you choose, one thing is true: if you have the drive to succeed, the determination to knuckle down and the ability through hard work, there is no reason for any aspiring student not to chart a pathway towards that goal over the coming year."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4144588.1579455686!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"department of education clashes with research agency over future direction","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t education columnist Brian Mooney, Dr Maurice Manning and publisher  Phyllis Mitchell at the recent publication of Ireland’s Yearbook of Education.The Department of Education has clashed with the country’s largest State-funded research agency over how taxpayers’ money should be spent, documents show.Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) has been drawing up a strategy for the years 2020 to 2025 to guide the direction of future investment.A letter sent by the department to the foundation, following a meeting to discuss the draft strategy, reveals sharp differences over how its funding should be spent.The five-page letter from William Beausang, a senior official who heads the department’s tertiary unit, warns SFI that there is a “clear risk” of its draft blueprint being “out of step” with developments in national and higher education research. It warns that its strategy needs to be much more closely aligned with other Government blueprints on innovation, future jobs and skills.In addition, it hints that the SFI is overreaching itself and needs to focus on its role as part of a much wider education and training system.“This serious concern is at the core of the reservations expressed at our meeting...” the letter states. “There is a responsibility to ensure that inidual strategies are aligned to and follow national policy and strategy. Successor“Rather than just a reference, there needs to be more direct alignment and representation in SFI’s strategy of what it can do to contribute to the achievement of Ireland’s national policy objectives...”Mr Beausang also said he would prefer if the foundation held off completing its strategy until a successor to the Government’s national research and innovation strategy – Innovation 2020 – has been considered.In a pointed reference to the role of SFI, the letter states the draft strategy did not adequately recognise the “centrality of the higher education system” for the delivery of a wide range of objectives for national policy, “not solely restricted to research, which is in the interest of SFI”. Details of the letter, seen by The , were first published recently in Ireland’s Yearbook of Education 2019-2020 by former government adviser John Walshe. More collaborativeMr Beausang also emphasised the role of the Higher Education Authority (HEA) and the need for a much stronger and more collaborative approach. “The HEA is therefore more than just one of the many parties to be consulted within the formulation of your strategy. In this department’s view, additional significant consultation and engagement with the HEA is essential to putting a successful strategy in place,” he wrote.It adds, pointedly, that research is generally performed by HEA core-funded staff within the higher education research system. “Any future development of the SFI Research Centres programme needs to recognise that the HEA core funding is an essential part of their operation.”He added that there were risks with extending the scope of SFI’s remit too broadly, which could lead to a “loss of focus, challenges in reconciling competing priorities and potentially impacting on the prioritisation of core work”. Limited referenceIt also refers to the “disappointingly brief and limited reference” in the draft strategy document to the emergence of technological universities."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4144594.1579469555!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government to consider sanctions for striking teachers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Government has previously imposed financial penalties on the ASTI as they were considered to have ‘repudiated’ a public service agreement by taking industrial action.The Department of Public Expenditure has said it will consider “in due course” whether thousands of teachers who are scheduled to go on strike next month will face financial penalties. About 19,000 members of the Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) are to stage a one-day stoppage on February 4th, which is likely to lead to the closure of hundreds of second-level schools.The Government in 2016 imposed financial penalties on members of the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI) after they were considered to have “repudiated” the public service agreement then in place by taking industrial action. Members of the ASTI lost out on about €15million in payments such as increments and other benefits as a result.The amounts lost varied depending where an inidual teacher stood on the pay scale and the date on which their increment was originally paid. Union sources said €1,000 in losses could be at the low end of the scale and it could be €2,000 or more in some cases.However, when nurses who were members of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) went on strike a year ago, the Government decided not to impose similar financial penalties. Asked if members of the TUI would face financial penalties as were imposed on ASTI teachers following their strike in 2016, the department said: “On the issue of sanctions, such matters will be given appropriate consideration in due course.” The planned strike is in protest at continuation of the controversial two-tier pay system in place for teachers recruited since 2011. The dispute is aimed at making what the union described as “ pay discrimination” a key political issue in the general election campaign. At least half of the country’s 700-plus secondary schools are likely to be affected by the planned strike.About 260 schools under the wing of Education and Training Boards would almost certainly close should the strike proceed. The sector’s umbrella body, Education and Training Boards Ireland, is due to meet on Monday to discuss the scale of school closures.In addition, a majority of the almost 100 community and comprehensive schools are also likely to close as are significant numbers of the 380 voluntary secondary schools.While staff in this latter category of schools are mostly represented by the ASTI , it is likely the union will direct its members not to provide cover for striking TUI members. This, say sources, would force school managers to shut many schools on health and safety grounds, even where only a relatively small number of staff are TUI members.Why might home-help staff strike? A spokesman for the school management body that represents voluntary secondary schools, the joint managerial body, confirmed it expects disruption but said it was difficult at this stage to say on what scale.Separately, Siptu has warned that up to 500 home-help staff working in community and disability services in Dublin may go on strike the day before the general election. The dispute centres on restoration of pay in organisations providing health and social care services that receive State grant aid (known technically as section 39 bodies) which was cut following the economic crash. Siptu is starting a ballot of these workers on Monday and will stage a one-day stoppage on February 7th if the vote is carried.

Photograph: Collins Courts Labour TD Joan Burton has objected to a proposed housing development in her constituency, stating that it is “detrimental to the local environment” and “damaging to residential amenity”.In a joint submission letter to the planning board, Ms Burton and local Labour councillor John Walsh called for the application to be rejected “as it is contrary to proper planning and sustainable development of the area”.“The scale and height of the proposed five-block, five-storey over-basement development is inappropriate and out of keeping with the pattern of development in the surrounding area,” they said in the letter. “A development consisting of 5 five-storey blocks will have a negative visual impact on surrounding estates.”The local representatives also stated there is an “inappropriate” mix of housing due to the focus on apartments.“Many of the assumptions made in the social infrastructure report are predicated on the idea that most occupants in the new development will not have families,” they said. “Any development on this site should include adequate provision for three- or four-bedroom family homes on a similar basis to neighbouring estates.”‘Flawed’The two politicians stated that the infrastructure report attached to the planning application is “fundamentally flawed”.“Overall the report reveals a striking ignorance of local conditions in terms of provision for schools and other necessary social infrastructure,” they said. “The scale of the development will impose unsustainable pressure on schools and childcare places in the area which are already heavily over-subscribed.”The development, if approved, will see the demolition of the existing two-storey nursing home and supporting buildings, according to the planning application.The apartment blocks will comprise 67 one-bedroom apartments, 104 two-bedroom apartments and 21 three-bedroom apartments. The ground floor of one of the blocks will also feature a crèche, a gym, a “residential amenity room” and a security room.The proposal also includes provision for the construction of 240 car-parking spaces, 180 basement cycle spaces and 172 surface cycle spaces.The application was submitted under the strategic housing development plan, meaning it bypasses the local authority and is submitted directly to the planning board.The Fingal County Council area committee passed a motion in November stating it would also object to the proposal because it is “fundamentally flawed, does not create a sustainable community and is contrary to proper planning”.In a statement to An Bord Pleanála as part of the application, Glenveagh homes said the proposed development “responds to the identified strategic need for a greater mix in the housing stock in urban areas”.The developer added that the proposal meets building height guidelines, density guidelines and apartment size guidelines."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4144778.1579473100!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"rt%C3%A9 receives complaint from union after issue with spokeswoman s accent","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUnite says RTÉ’s decision was \t‘highly insensitive’ and reflected a ‘lack of understanding of the vulnerability’ of migrant workers in the hospitality sector.

Photograph: EPAAn outbreak of a new coronavirus in China has spread to more cities, Chinese authorities said on Monday, as the number of patients tripled and a third person died, stoking concerns about the containment of the virus.The new cases were identified in the cities of Wuhan, Beijing and Shenzhen.The Daxing health commission in the capital Beijing said it had confirmed two cases of coronavirus, while the southern Guangdong province’s health commission confirmed one case in Shenzhen.They mark the first cases in China beyond Wuhan where the virus first emerged.Chinese officials have identified the infection as being a strain of coronavirus. They say it has led to an outbreak of viral pneumonia but much about it remains unknown.The virus belongs in the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 200203 outbreak that also started in China.Its symptoms include fever and difficulty in breathing, which are similar to many other respiratory diseases and pose complications for screening efforts.The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 136 new cases of pneumonia caused by the coronavirus strain had been found in the city over the weekend, adding to 62 already known cases.A third death occurred on Saturday, the authority said in a statement.This brings the total number of known cases worldwide to more than 200, underscoring the challenge for health authorities seeking to contain the outbreak.Hundreds of millions of Chinese tourists will be traveling domestically and abroad during the Lunar New Year holiday period that starts later this week.A report by London Imperial College’s MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis estimated that by January 12th there were 1,723 cases in Wuhan City with onset of related symptoms. Chinese health authorities have not commented directly on the report.Authorities around the globe, including in the United States and many Asian countries, have stepped up screening of travellers from Wuhan. Outside China, two cases have been reported in Thailand and one in Japan, all involving people from Wuhan or who recently visited the city.China’s National Health Commission said on Sunday it will step up prevention efforts, but acknowledged it still doesn’t know the source of the virus.Shares in pharmaceutical firms and mask makers in China surged Monday because of the outbreak.The outbreak was one of the top trending topics on Chinese social media platform Weibo, where many users expressed concerns about their safety.“Who knows how many people who have been to Wuhan may be unaware that they have already been infected?” one user asked.China’s Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily newspaper, said in an editorial the government needs to disclose all information and not repeat the mistakes made with Sars. Chinese officials covered up the Sars outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumours forced it to reveal the epidemic.“Concealment would be a serious blow to the government’s credibility and might trigger greater social panic,” the editorial said. - Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4144233.1579347387!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain s chancellor says no alignment with eu after brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid says there will be an impact on business one way or the other, some will benefit, some won’t.

It could also further complicate discussions with Brussels.Talks with the EU already face a daunting schedule this year, with the EU probably agreeing its formal negotiating mandate only in late February and the official transition period expiring on December 31st. Mr Johnson says that deadline is immovable, while EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier calls it “extremely challenging.”The debate over how much Britain will erge from the EU with regards to regulatory standards is set to form a key plank for how the talks progress .German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that the further the UK goes it alone, the more it will be regarded in Brussels as a direct competitor.“There will be an impact on business one way or the other, some will benefit, some won’t, ” Mr Javid said in the Financial Times interview, urging companies to adjust their strategies accordingly. He plans to back more projects in regions outside London and the southeast, and pump more funds into training the country’s workforce.As for the UK’s finances, Mr Javid said he wants to bolster growth rates to between 2.7 per cent and 2.8 per cent a year.

Photograph: Will OliverEPAAn online fundraising campaign seeking to have Big Ben ring to welcome in Brexit at 11pm on January 31st has raised more than £150,000 (€175,000).Stand Up 4 Brexit’s “Big Ben must bong for Brexit” campaign had raised £152,470 of its £500,000 target from almost 10,000 donors on the GofFundMe website by Friday morning.Those who wish to celebrate Britain leaving the EU will want to do so in the same manner as New Year’s Eve – by looking at a clock, the campaign’s organisers wrote online.“The natural choice for this would be Big Ben but because it is currently undergoing refurbishment, special measures would have to be put in place, which could cost up to £500,000,” a statement by StandUp4Brexit founder Rebecca Ryan and Mark Francois MP added.“However, because there is a lead time to make the necessary preparations, we would need to raise this amount by this weekend.”Mr Francois had earlier accused the House of Commons authorities of exaggerating the cost of bringing the bell, which has been silent since 2017, back into operation.In a video posted on the fundraising site, Mr Francois said he was “delighted to announce that our Eurosceptic colleagues from StandUp4Brexit have agreed to host a crowdfunding campaign to help raise half a million pounds so that Big Ben can chime at 11pm on the 31st of January”.He added that the campaign hoped to get contributions “from across the four nations of the United Kingdom, what the prime minister likes to call the ‘awesome foursome’”.Mr Francois said it was “inconceivable” that the clock used to mark the UK’s departure from the EU “could be any other than the most iconic timepiece on Earth, which is Big Ben”.He finished his appeal by saying “please give an amount on this website now so we can properly celebrate becoming a free country again”.They added that “Britons are currently donating more than £80 a minute to the campaign, with an average donation of £16”.British prime minister Boris Johnson had said on BBC Breakfast on Tuesday that the government was “working up a plan so people can bung a bob for a Big Ben bong”.Donations to the campaign include £1,000 from Mr Francois, while business secretary Andrea Leadsom promised £10.There were also small donations from “Dominic Grieve”, “Jeremy Corbyn” and “John Bercow” but these were all thought likely to be fake names.Restoring the bell was discussed at a meeting of the House of Commons Commission on Monday, but it was ruled out after it was revealed it could cost £500,000.Commons speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who is chairman of the commission, said: “You are talking about £50,000 a bong.”Whether Big Ben bongs or not, Brexiteers intend to gather outside parliament to mark the UK’s departure from the EU.Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said the Leave Means Leave campaign group had been been given approval to hold an event in Parliament Square on January 31st. “It is a big moment in the history of this nation to celebrate,” he said. – PA"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

We supported the fight against the US with all our hearts.A decade on, however, Mr Obeidi has become an unlikely voice for Iraq\u0027s US military presence to remain. Pressure on America to leave has grown after the assassination of Iran\u0027s top general Qassem Solaimani, who was killed by a US drone strike in Baghdad two weeks ago. Youths read a newspaper as they sit by graffiti murals drawn by anti-government protesters along the walls of a traffic tunnel at the anti-government protest sit-in in the capital Baghdad\u0026#39s central Tahrir SquareBut a withdrawal is regarded with horror by many Sunnis, who, for all their past quarrels with the US, see it as very much the lesser of two evils compared to Tehran.If the US leaves, we will be an even easier bite for the Iranians, Mr Obeidi, who now scrapes a living running a food stand, told The .We are no big fans of the US, but they should not leave until such time as the Iranians leave us alone.Mr Obeidi spoke out amid a looming showdown over the 5,000-strong US troop presence, whose main base west of Baghdad was targeted by Iranian missiles 11 days ago.Officially, the troops are only in Iraq to help in the ongoing fight against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil), but in retaliation for Mr Soleimani\u0027s death, Tehran has pressured Baghdad to expel them.Already, pro-Iranian factions in Iraq\u0027s Shia-dominated government have passed a non-binding vote in parliament urging the troops\u0027 expulsion.A mourner walk back from a funeral ceremony for Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, passing graffiti on the wall of the former US embassy in Tehran, IranPrivately, however, Iraqi officials fear a pull-out by Washington will hand Tehran even greater influence over the country\u0027s affairs. That fear is expressed rather more openly in Sunni communities, who make up a third of Iraq\u0027s 38 million population.Having ruled the roost in Saddam\u0027s time, they now claim to be treated like second-class citizens by the Shia majority government. Nowhere is that truer than in Adhamiyah, a once-prosperous district of Beverley Hills-style mansions that used to be nicknamed Chelsea-on-Tigris.During the height of the anti-US insurgency, it also became a sectarian battleground, as local Sunni fighters, backed by extremists from al-Qaeda, waged a savage war of tit-for-tat killings against Shia militias bankrolled by Tehran.By 2007, as the Shia militias began to get the upper hand, the US military built a Belfast-style Peace Wall to keep Adhamiyah separate from neighbouring Shia districts. But while the 12 foot-high barrier has since been dismantled, the memories of that time have stayed.    Nearly everybody in Adhamiyah, for example, has a story about losing a friend or relative to the Shia militias, which were trained and bankrolled by Soleimani\u0027s Revolutionary Guards force.While some parts of Iraq staged public mourning ceremonies for Mr Soleimani\u0027s death, here in Adhamiyah, there was private celebration.Qassem Soleimani helped destroy this country, and turned it into the tail of Iran, said Ayad Salman, who owns a shop in a square in Adhamiyah where Saddam made his final public appearance during the invasion.Saddam looked after us and made Iraq respected by its neighbours - now they are all eating away at us. The US has to stay, as the Iraqi government is now on the side of Iran.It is not just grizzled ex-Ba\u0027athists who rejoiced at Mr Soleimani\u0027s passing. So too did protesters in Baghdad\u0027s Tahrir Square, who have been demonstrating since October for better public services and an end to corruption in government.While the crowds are mainly Shia, more than 450 have been shot dead during clashes with security forces. Washington has blamed some of the deaths on Shia militia snipers, allegedly acting on Tehran\u0027s orders to stop an Arab Spring style uprising.An elderly Iraqi woman, her face covered with a national flag, cries as she watches anti-government demonstrators protesting in BaghdadEverybody was happy about Soleimani being killed, although it would have been nicer if we Iraqis could have done it ourselves, said Salim Sadeq Muassim, a retired soldier.When I heard the news I ran to the shop to buy chocolates to give to everyone in the street. My neighbour even grabbed his Kalashnikov and started firing in the air in celebration. We need US troops to stay because they preserving our soul from militia control - if they left now, the militias would shoot us all here.On Friday night violence in Tahrir Square flared again for the first time since Soleimani\u0027s death, with two protesters shot dead. On a bridge over the Tigris, groups of masked youths hurled petrol bombs at police, who responded with tear gas and stun grenades.They were using live ammunition against us, one demonstrator told the  at a makeshift hospital at Tahrir Square.Sunnis in majority-Sunni cities, such as Anbar and Mosul, have largely been reluctant to take to the streets in huge numbers as Shia Muslims have for fear of being accused of extremism or sympathy with Isil.Some have feared it may send the message they are somehow ungrateful to Iraqi forces, backed by Shia militias, which only two years ago suffered huge casualties liberating the two cities from the jihadists.As of yet, no time frame has been set for any final decision on the US deployment. So far, US officials have rejected the move, pointing out that it could damage the fight against Isis.Iraq\u0027s caretaker prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, who took up his post after his predecessor resigned over the shooting of protesters, said last week that the decision should be made by his successor, who may not be in place for months.Many see that as a simply a way of kicking the matter into the long grass - a fudge that could anger Tehran, but will be welcome in America\u0027s former graveyard in Adhamiyah.We need the US here until we get a leader who can rule Iraq without interference from others, said Abu Mustafa, a cigarette vendor. By that criteria, however, America could be here for many more years to come.Chinese New Year 2020: Rats, luck and why you should avoid medicine, laundry and crying childrenAustralia Day 2020: why the British sent convicts Down Under - and how they named the countryFears of \u0026#39second-class\u0026#39 railways in the North if HS2 is scrapped leave Boris in a Catch-22 Prince Harry breaks silence on royal split: \u0026#39There was no other option\u0026#39Australia weather: Freak hailstorms and monster dust clouds sweep east coastPrince Harry speech in full as he says he and Meghan had \u0026#39no other option\u0026#39 but to step back from Royal dutiesHow will the Brexit transition period work?Brexit day: what happens after January 31?Monday morning news briefing: Prince Harry breaks silence on royal exitMysterious Sars-like virus spreading across China amid sharp rise in new cases and a third deathComment: Africa must not squander this golden chance for an investment boomThree men dead in Ilford east London stabbings Comment: The Royal deal is good for everyone, except for Prince HarryAfrica\u0026#39s richest woman accused of corruption and siphoning off state assets The vast chasm between what the Sussexes wanted and what they got Government to redecorate crumbling village halls with new funding scheme to combat lonelinesGetting lost is biggest cause of car arguments despite sat navs, says AA surveyBotched filler complaints double, new figures show, amid concern over \u0026#39DIY\u0026#39 online trainingThousands of rail staff trained in suicide prevention as attempts on railways rise sharply since 2014 Doctors are replacing the roles that used to be done by priests and barmaids, says the NHS\u0026#39s head of social prescribing We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"liberalism collapsing weight hypocritical intolerance","story":"Lawrence Fox has been shouted down for arguing that fear of accusations of racism is a factor in grooming gang casesFrom grooming gangs to woke campuses, the liberal left’s double standards are clear for all to seeMany liberals seem utterly baffled by the crises that have enveloped their creed  over a decade or more .

Few want to address the issue that everybody knows is most pertinent: the abusers were, once again, mainly South Asian, Muslim men. Eighteen months ago, Sajid Javid, then Home Secretary, commissioned research into the characteristics of grooming gangs to understand what role cultural factors might play in the abuse.Read Nick Timothy\u0027s latest column on telegraph every Sunday night from 9.30pm  With the Home Office silent, we must turn instead to research by one of its agencies. Child sex abusers are not disproportionately likely to be from any one racial or religious group, but according to the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre, for gangs that target underage girls because of their vulnerability to exploitation – rather than because of sexual interest in children – 75 per cent of perpetrators are Asian.Two days after the Manchester story broke, Equity, the actors’ trade union, called on its members to “unequivocally denounce” Laurence Fox. Among other things, the actor had raised grooming gangs during an appearance on the BBC. His crime was to deny that criticism of Meghan Markle was racist, and to argue that fear of accusations of racism was a factor in the grooming gang cases. Given the evidence accumulated in abuse inquiries to date, he was quite clearly correct. And yet the liberal-left reaction was to shout him down, attack his character and insult his “white privilege”.This example of illiberal liberalism is not a one-off. Last Tuesday, Sheffield University confirmed it plans to pay students to police behaviour on campus, challenging perceived “microaggressions” deemed to be offensive. Examples of microaggressions provided by the university included students arguing that too many problems are “turned into a race issue”. Restricting free speech, it seems, is not enough: the university’s policy prevents discussion even about the parameters of acceptable speech.Next up, Rebecca Long-Bailey was attacked for her position on abortion. A practising Roman Catholic, the Labour leadership candidate had questioned whether women should have late-term abortions on the grounds that their babies were disabled. Denying any legitimacy to her argument, and ignoring that abortion has always been a conscience issue in Parliament, meaning MPs are not whipped to vote in any particular way, Long-Bailey’s beliefs were attacked as “absolutely toxic”, and critics suggested her policies would be “dictated by the Vatican.” Of course, the liberal-left would never dream of using such language about other faiths, yet the logic of their position is that Catholics should never hold office.But why is this happening? Why is liberalism – especially on the left – becoming so illiberal and intolerant?There has always been a split among liberals between those who value pluralism as the means by which we manage difference in complex societies, and those who value difference only as a means to truth, and with it an increasingly perfect society. These tensions go back to liberal thinkers like John Stuart Mill, but they are becoming more pronounced as left-liberals become more assertive.If difference is only a means to truth, and reason is what leads us to truth, then those with whom liberals differ must be irrational. They represent institutions, norms, traditions and opinions – “prejudice!” – that must be overcome. Just think about how they talk about anybody who disagrees with their positions on almost anything, from immigration to transgender rights.And if identity politics are what matters most – and for left-liberals the old liberal dream of equal political rights is no longer enough – then immutable characteristics, like race and sex, can be attacked, but only if you are attacking white men to compensate for their privilege.This is how liberalism has become so confusing and contradictory. It is how it has grown increasingly illiberal, intolerant and – strangely for a supposedly universal theory – morally relativistic. For left-liberals, the systematic sexual abuse of white, working-class girls by Asian men must be swept under the carpet, the Catholic beliefs of politicians must be suppressed, and the language of students must be monitored and restricted. Sure, it’s liberalism, but not as we once knew it.Read Nick Timothy\u0027s latest column on telegraph every Sunday night from 9.30pm  Fears of \u0026#39second-class\u0026#39 railways in the North if HS2 is scrapped leave Boris in a Catch-22 Prince Harry breaks silence on royal split: \u0026#39There was no other option\u0026#39Australia weather: Freak hailstorms and monster dust clouds sweep east coastPrince Harry speech in full as he says he and Meghan had \u0026#39no other option\u0026#39 but to step back from Royal dutiesHow will the Brexit transition period work?Brexit day: what happens after January 31?Monday morning news briefing: Prince Harry breaks silence on royal exitMysterious Sars-like virus spreading across China amid sharp rise in new cases and a third deathComment: Africa must not squander this golden chance for an investment boomThree men dead in Ilford east London stabbings Comment: The Royal deal is good for everyone, except for Prince HarryAfrica\u0026#39s richest woman accused of corruption and siphoning off state assets The vast chasm between what the Sussexes wanted and what they got Government to redecorate crumbling village halls with new funding scheme to combat lonelinesGetting lost is biggest cause of car arguments despite sat navs, says AA surveyBotched filler complaints double, new figures show, amid concern over \u0026#39DIY\u0026#39 online trainingThousands of rail staff trained in suicide prevention as attempts on railways rise sharply since 2014 Doctors are replacing the roles that used to be done by priests and barmaids, says the NHS\u0026#39s head of social prescribing Number of prisoners developing drug problems in jail doubles to 15 per cent in five years, study findsWhy this deal or no deal was the stark reality of choice for the SussexesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 20 january 2020","story":"Prime Minister Boris Johnson gestures as world leaders wait for group photo at an international summit on securing peace in LibyaFears of \u0026#39second-class\u0026#39 railways in the North if HS2 is scrapped leave Boris in a Catch-22 Prince Harry breaks silence on royal split: \u0026#39There was no other option\u0026#39Australia weather: Freak hailstorms and monster dust clouds sweep east coastPrince Harry speech in full as he says he and Meghan had \u0026#39no other option\u0026#39 but to step back from Royal dutiesHow will the Brexit transition period work?Brexit day: what happens after January 31?Monday morning news briefing: Prince Harry breaks silence on royal exitMysterious Sars-like virus spreading across China amid sharp rise in new cases and a third deathComment: Africa must not squander this golden chance for an investment boomThree men dead in Ilford east London stabbings Comment: The Royal deal is good for everyone, except for Prince HarryAfrica\u0026#39s richest woman accused of corruption and siphoning off state assets The vast chasm between what the Sussexes wanted and what they got Government to redecorate crumbling village halls with new funding scheme to combat lonelinesGetting lost is biggest cause of car arguments despite sat navs, says AA surveyBotched filler complaints double, new figures show, amid concern over \u0026#39DIY\u0026#39 online trainingThousands of rail staff trained in suicide prevention as attempts on railways rise sharply since 2014 Doctors are replacing the roles that used to be done by priests and barmaids, says the NHS\u0026#39s head of social prescribing Number of prisoners developing drug problems in jail doubles to 15 per cent in five years, study findsWhy this deal or no deal was the stark reality of choice for the SussexesDuke of Sussex\u0026#39s speech about Royal Family split, in fullWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"royal megxit deal good everyone except prince harry","story":"As the Duke swaps the English aristocracy for North American meritocracy, he might struggle to fit inThe Royal departure deal feels like a mini-abdication: no public funds, no HRH, no Royal duties, no representing the Queen and the Sussexes have to pay rent if they want to go on living at home. Even my parents never made me do that.It’s all very different from what the Duke and Duchess posted on their website a few days ago proposing a half-in, half-out business arrangement that, upon reflection, looks stunningly naive. The Palace has obviously said: “Sorry but it’s all or nothing,” and they get almost nothing except their celebrity and the freedom to chash-in on it, which must have its consolations. In short: “You can host the Oscars but not as HRH.”The deal offers something to everyone – almost. It’s good for the monarchy because it allows it to define its borders. If the Sussexes had been permitted to come and go at will, not only would their own status have been unclear but a degree of institutional integrity would’ve been lost, too: imagine a Pope announcing that he’s Pope on weekdays but would like the freedom to spend the weekends with his wife and kids. Clerics and royals are not “jobs” but vocations that define every part of your life for your entire life. This had to be made clear.But even without being called Royal Highness, one is still a royal by birth, and Meghan Markle became one by marrying Harry – so the deal is fine for her, too. She has lost nothing. On the contrary, she gains material for a darn good book, along with the greatest honour that Hollywood can bestow: Meghan has landed a voiceover in a Disney project (in exchange for a donation to charity).Sussexes quit | The best comment and analysisWhat about Harry? Well, I hope the public will be kind. He has walked away from one set of responsibilities, it’s true, but he did so to honour another – being a father and a husband – and that’s worth respect. Plus, of all the people taking a gamble here, the greatest is Harry’s. I have no doubt that he is self-possessed and has a clear idea of what he wants to do (his service to army and charity proves that, so don’t ever call him self-indulgent), but he is leaving a structured, cloistered existence within a very narrow social circle in England for a ruthless North American meritocracy that will be thousands of miles apart in attitudes and culture.I lived in Hollywood for roughly a year I really like Hollywood people. They might seem vapid but most of them come from absolutely nothing and are self-made – and they are often intellectually sophisticated. Harry has two A-levels and likes playing polo. The only polo in Los Angeles is the Ralph Lauren store on Rodeo Drive.Once the mystique of the monarchy is removed from someone they inevitably become diminishedOnce the mystique of the monarchy is removed from someone they inevitably become diminished. I’m sorry, really sorry, it’s just what happens. When the Obamas met the Sussexes in the past, the honour was the Obamas’, but now, if they meet again, the honour will belong to the Sussexes because Barack and Michelle are Harvard graduates who ran the most powerful nation on Earth, whereas Meghan does voiceover work and Harry, er...“Remind me, Harry, what do you do?”Oh Harry, lovely Harry, you did all this wrong! If you were going to walk away, you should’ve run away and made it romantic and tossed your titles in the river. If this was 1968, you and Meghan would disappear and reappear in Marrakech, living in a riad with flowers in your hair and nappies on the line, looking beautiful and radical.The Sussexes say they want to move in a “progressive” direction, and it’s fascinating how the meaning of that word has changed over time. We knock the Sixties, but at least the flower power radicals took risks and gave things up - at least Jane Fonda had the guts to give her money to the Black Panthers and meet the Viet Cong. Hanoi Jane is 82 now and she’s still getting arrested: she was clapped in irons again last month in Washington DC, along with Sally Field and Ted Danson.But when a rich celeb goes woke in 2019, they rarely join a picket line or give away all their money they call Trump a fascist and adopt a koala. It’s an odd complaint for a conservative to make – that revolution ain’t what it used to be – but for all the errors of the Sixties, I admire that generation’s “all or nothing attitude”. The closest we have to it now is the green movement, but even that has to compromise here and there. I bet Harry and Meghan used up a few air miles during this family crisis.The most self-giving person in all of this is also the quietest. I refer, of course, to the Queen. She was at church on Sunday, always on time, without a hair out of place or a hint of melancholy, despite everything she’s been through. Kids nowadays call this sort of behaviour “fake” because she doesn’t share her feelings on the internet, but actually it’s a special kind of integrity. The Queen has devoted her life to maintaining a way of existence, to service and duty. She is the most privileged person in the land but, apparently, free of ego. She has never, ever let us down. That’s why we need her more now than ever.Chinese New Year 2020: Rats, luck and why you should avoid medicine, laundry and crying childrenAustralia Day 2020: why the British sent convicts Down Under - and how they named the countryFears of \u0026#39second-class\u0026#39 railways in the North if HS2 is scrapped leave Boris in a Catch-22 Prince Harry breaks silence on royal split: \u0026#39There was no other option\u0026#39Australia weather: Freak hailstorms and monster dust clouds sweep east coastPrince Harry speech in full as he says he and Meghan had \u0026#39no other option\u0026#39 but to step back from Royal dutiesHow will the Brexit transition period work?Brexit day: what happens after January 31?Monday morning news briefing: Prince Harry breaks silence on royal exitMysterious Sars-like virus spreading across China amid sharp rise in new cases and a third deathComment: Africa must not squander this golden chance for an investment boomThree men dead in Ilford east London stabbings Africa\u0026#39s richest woman accused of corruption and siphoning off state assets The vast chasm between what the Sussexes wanted and what they got Government to redecorate crumbling village halls with new funding scheme to combat lonelinesGetting lost is biggest cause of car arguments despite sat navs, says AA surveyBotched filler complaints double, new figures show, amid concern over \u0026#39DIY\u0026#39 online trainingThousands of rail staff trained in suicide prevention as attempts on railways rise sharply since 2014 Doctors are replacing the roles that used to be done by priests and barmaids, says the NHS\u0026#39s head of social prescribing Number of prisoners developing drug problems in jail doubles to 15 per cent in five years, study findsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/10/16/bank-of-england.jpg","title":"economics news brexit interest rates latest projections bank england","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Analysis: Focus forced back\u0026nbsponto economic data and statements by central bankersAfter more than a decade when the outlook for interest rates was dominated by an assessment of the impact of first, the global financial and eurozone crises, and more recently Brexit, traders are once again getting used to the need to closely analyse the economic data and comments by central bankers.Since the Bank of England cut rates to 0.5 per cent in March 2009, its monetary policy committee (MPC) only changed the Bank Rate three times since then as the £435bn of quantitative easing did the heavy lifting involved in stimulating the economy. To put that in context, the previous decade saw an average of four rate changes a year.But a flurry of economic data and a series of speeches by members of the nine-strong MPC over the past week have left economists in a quandary over whether the MPC will hold firm at 0.75 per cent or order a cut. “The decision is on a knife edge,” said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics after official inflation figures were published.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThat showed annual inflation had dropped to 1.3 per cent in December from 1.5 per cent in November and further below the 2.0 per cent figures that the Bank is mandated to target two years hence.It followed official data for economic growth in November that showed the overall economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in November to leave the rolling three-month growth rate at just 0.1 per cent.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sweden\u0027s Jennie-Lee Burmansson competing in the final run of the Freestyle Skiing Womens Freeski Slopestyle at the Leysin Park in Leysin, during the 2020 Lausanne Winter Youth Olympic GamesFirefighters take part in a demonstration to protest against the attacks against them during interventions in Strasbourg.

The first is that all the data show what happened in November and December. Since then the uncertainty over Brexit has been removed, at least temporarily, and chancellor Sajid Javid has indicated he will use the 11 March Budget for a spending and investment spree.The second is that surveys covering the period after the election such as the house price reports from Halifax and RICs and the Deloitte CFO survey were pretty upbeat.The second is that the statements by Dr Carney, Dr\u0026nbspTenreyro and Dr Vlieghe were conditional on future signs of a slowdown. With that in mind, traders and economists will be focused on a slew of data over the next two weeks on the labour market, industry and retail sales.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes.

(EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Witherspoon added: “Look, we make product and then it is up to you guys. You have to decide how you feel about it. That’s how it works. I have no problem hearing very real opinions about material. It actually helps us make it better and work harder about parts that don’t make sense. I welcome the criticism.”Aniston then chipped in with: “Especially constructive criticism.”The team also teased where The Morning Show is headed in its second season. “We have a lot explore. It’s not just #MeToo. We explore racism, sexism, homophobia – all the things currently happening in news media,” said Witherspoon.“We’re just beginning because there’s a whole new world order. It’s chaos. No one knows who is in charge. What does leadership mean at this point? And I think that’s what we’re exploring in this culture as we speak.”\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They asked me to prove that I have applied for settled status.”Government denies U-turn on giving EU citizens physical proof of rightEU settlement scheme delays leave people unable to get jobsWarning over settled status scheme for EU nationalsAnother said they were trying to get on a list for council housing and had been strongly recommended to get settled status first, while a third respondent said they were unable to renew their driving license without proof of EU settlement.Maike Bohn, co-founder of the3million, said the findings were a “sign of things to come”, adding: “Millions more people are being brought into the hostile environment and we’re already seeing the impact, even though the new immigration rules do not yet apply.“It is likely to get worse when we go into the transition period on 31 January, because the very emphatic rhetoric about ‘getting Brexit done’ means many will assume proof of settled status is needed. Confusion and chaos is to be expected.”Labour MP David\u0026nbspLammy\u0026nbspsaid the way EU nationals had been treated since the 2016 referendum was a “disgrace”.“Rather than reassuring our European friends, neighbours and relatives who contribute so much to our society, both Theresa May and Boris Johnson showed contempt by insulting them and using them as bargaining chips,” he added.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Nine per cent of respondents who had applied were still waiting for a decision.It also indicated that many respondents believe they are not required to apply for settled status, with 29 per cent saying they had not applied and 7 per cent of these think they did not need to.Chai Patel, legal policy director at JCWI, called on ministers to scrap the hostile environment, warning that as long as it remains “this sort of discrimination will only increase”.“With such an extraordinary lack of moral leadership under a\u0026nbsp government that continues to support the hostile environment for immigrants, it is no wonder that EU nationals are already facing additional barriers to living their lives in the UK,” he added.A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“We value the contribution EU citizens make to our country and we want them to stay. The EU settlement scheme is working - over 2.5 million people have been granted a secure digital status so far - guaranteeing their rights in UK law.“This digital status future-proofs their rights and is linked to their passport or ID card, replacing physical documents which can get lost, stolen, damaged, tampered with and expire.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There was a 7.4 per cent annual increase in the number of sales agreed.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesMiles Shipside, director and housing market analyst at Rightmove, said the figures indicated that many buyers and sellers felt the election result had given a “window of stability”.“The housing market dislikes uncertainty, and the unsettled political outlook over the last three and a half years since the EU referendum caused some potential home movers to hesitate,” he said.House prices rise at fastest monthly rate since 2013“Whilst a substantial rise is the norm in January, buoyed by the start of a new year, this is the biggest new year price surge that we have ever recorded.”Mr Shipside said that while there might be “more twists and turns” in the Brexit saga, there was now an opportunity for sellers to get their property on the market for a spring move unaffected by Brexit deadlines“There now seems to be a release of this pent-up demand, which suggests we are in store for an active spring market. The early birds are on it, with over 1.3 million buyer enquiries to agents since the election,” he said.However, Mr Shipside warned sellers not to get “carried away” with their pricing and miss out on a window of increased activity, saying that high prices meant many buyers faced stretched affordability.The Rightmove report will add to growing evidence that the election result has\u0026nbsptriggered renewed optimism in the housing market. Last week Halifax said prices rose in December at the fastest pace since 2013, while the surveyors’\u0026nbsporganisation RICS said 17 per cent more respondents had seen a rise rather than fall in enquiries from new buyers.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The varied landscapes and lives of residents wedged in these borderlands speak of two different systems that have coexisted on one another’s doorstep.Far from the marches and salvos of tear gas and petrol bombs over the past half-year of anti-government protests that have convulsed Hong Kong, the residents in this border realm have borne witness to both rapid urbanisation, as China booms, and the preservation of a slower pace of life.About 20 miles\u0026nbsplong, this boundary meanders between fish ponds, farmland, sleepy traditional villages and grassy hills on the Hong Kong side, with the gleaming skyscrapers of China’s high-tech city of Shenzhen on the other. Shenzhen, once itself the bucolic backwater, has risen into China’s giddy vision of a digital, high-tech future.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHong Kong is world’s most visited city in 2019We may have won the elections battle, but the war is ongoingHong Kong police ‘hack into more than 3,700 mobile phones’Mr\u0026nbspLam, now in his eighties, lives in a house without mobile phone reception, where he farms and catches crabs. A narrow sliver of water separates him from mainland China. He recalls living in a wooden cabin along the Shenzhen River\u0026nbspwith his family 70 years ago. There were only “old and broken” sheds on the far shore back then, he says, gazing into the distance. “Of course, the mainland is much more advanced than before. Everything is good, even the streets are beautiful.”Over past decades of political upheaval in communist China, waves of mainlanders flooded across the border into Hong Kong, seeking peace and a better life. Lam still remembers the flashlights of the British-run police piercing the dark as they chased illegal immigrants making a dash for freedom.Andrew Kwok, an old fish farmer living in the area, recalls those who drowned making the perilous crossing. “There were a lot of them, hundreds of dead bodies in the river,” he says.The flickering, lonely torches have now been replaced by a vibrant mega-city with a million flashing lights. The living quality for people on both sides may have converged, but a gulf remains. For these two peoples, it remains a struggle to reconcile shifting eras, values and dreams.Merrin Ke, 23, grew up in Shenzhen but got her masters degree from Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University.

She says: “Hong Kong people used to come to have fun in Shenzhen and people from mainland China also liked to visit Hong Kong. But now such things are becoming less and less. I still hope everyone can put differences aside, and it’s not enough for just one side to do this.

But as Oliver Carroll finds out, not everyone is pleasedIt was when the tree fellers arrived in early 2009 with their bulldozers that Nikolai Ulasevich, a local activist, knew the game was up.\u0026nbspThere might not have been a published order to build an atomic power station in the fields overlooking his homestead in the village of Vornyany\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspbut a decision had clearly been made. In authoritarian Belarus\u0026nbspthose decisions rarely have a reverse gear.\u0026nbspIn the years that followed, Ulasevich watched as the gigantic cooling towers and system blocks of Belarus’s first nuclear power station took shape. Construction, which was led by the Russian state nuclear agency Rosatom, would be far from straightforward. A string of incidents delayed its opening, but the first reactor is finally due to go online early 2020.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTo say the construction of the Belarusian nuclear\u0026nbspplant has been controversial would be to trivialise the history of these lands.\u0026nbspChernobyl lies only seven miles from Belarus’s southern border, and the nuclear accident, still the world’s worst, has left the deepest of scars locally.\u0026nbspThe direction of the wind in spring 1986 – and the Soviet authorities’ decision to avoid major harm\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspMoscow –\u0026nbspmeant Belarus suffered more than any other region in the union.\u0026nbspAt the moment that\u0026nbspthe radioactive clouds moved towards the capital,\u0026nbspair force pilots were ordered to\u0026nbspchase down\u0026nbspthe toxic clouds and seed them with jets of silver iodide.\u0026nbspMuch of the\u0026nbspsouthernmost region of Homel remains seriously contaminated, with elevated oncology levels as a result. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Illegal tour of Chernobyl visits forgotten sites Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Evening in the ghost town of PripyatA gas mask hangs in a building inside the Chernobyl Exclusion ZoneRemains of Soviet propaganda in one of the barracks of the abandoned anti-aircraft base Volkhov near the Chernobyl NPPThe shell of a television stands inside a building in the Chernobyl exclusion zoneA children\u0027s play area inside the Chernobyl exclusion zoneA Soviet-era classroom in the Chernobyl exclusion zoneTourists inside the Chernobyl exclusion zoneDuga was a Soviet over-the-horizon (OTH) radar system used as part of the Soviet missile defense early-warning radar networkIn the Pripyat abandoned apartments you can still see the abandoned belongings of evacuated residents of the cityAmbulance car model RAF-2203 Latvija (nickname Rafik) on the background of the Medical Sanitary Unit 126 in Pripyat.

They talk about the tiredness the strange, dryness of the mouth the rumours that it might be a good idea to take iodine,\u0026nbspbut the lack of reliable information. They will also tell you about a cloud of secrecy almost as harmful as the black cumulus masses that had their radioactive bowels emptied over southern Belarus.“It was only later that panic had a chance to set in,” remembers Maria Ivanovna, a local hotelier who declined to give her surname. A resident of Astravets\u0026nbsp(Russian: Ostrovets), the main town serving the nuclear plant 10 miles down the road, she says locals were evenly split about the project. Many\u0026nbspare delighted with above-average wages and improvements to local infrastructure – especially the newcomers who have tripled the population since work began. There is a new sports centre, hospital and road connecting to the Minsk-Vilnius motorway. But her generation is “uneasy”, she says.“The thought of what happened back in 1986 can’t fail to make you anxious about what may happen. You know they may not tell you the whole truth.”Lithuania, the European nation that borders Belarus just 10 miles west of Astravets, is bitterly opposed to the nuclear plant. It says it has not been properly consulted and claims the plant breaches post-Fukushima distance guidelines – in particular, a recommendation that nuclear power stations should not be built closer than 100km of major conurbations. The new nuclear plant lies just 30 miles east of the\u0026nbspLithuanian capital, Vilnius.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But several reported incidents do\u0026nbspgive pause for thought.\u0026nbspFrom what we know, the reactor vessel in Belarus has already been involved in at least two accidents. The first was in July 2016, when it was apparently dropped from a crane during installation. Belarusian authorities took weeks to admit a\u0026nbsp“minor” incident. Five months later, a replacement reactor vessel collided with a railway pylon while being transported. At least five workers have died in construction accidents. There was at least one fire incident in the control room.\u0026nbspThe outside world would likely have stayed little the wiser were it not for the opposition activist Ulasevich monitoring from his modest home, which he shares with his wife, a few chickens and sheep, three\u0026nbspmiles away from the new power station. He said he found out about the dropped reactor vessel in conversation with a local construction worker.“He swore that he saw it break free of ropes at a height of two\u0026nbspor three\u0026nbspmetres,” he says.\u0026nbspA spokesperson\u0026nbspfor Rosatom tells\u0026nbspThe Independent that allegations about safety issues are “entirely without merit”. The reactors being used are among the safest in the world and designed to risk the possibility of “even the most unlikely event” such as a plane strike. “Anti-nuclear scaremongering doesn’t help to fight climate change”, the spokesman says, “and it appears to be only devised to protect the profits of the fossil-fuel energy sector in the region”.What is drawing thousands of tourists to Chernobyl and killing fields?Others are not so sure. Yury Voronezhtsev, the man who led the official Soviet official response to Chernobyl, says he could not believe any statement that the plant was “safe”.\u0026nbsp“I don’t believe that our Belarusian construction workers are any better than the Soviet ones,” he tells\u0026nbspThe Independent. “We have the same people, and the same systems. Don’t forget that Anatoly Aleksandrov, the physicist who designed Chernobyl, assured us his plant was so safe it could be built on Red Square. His confidence did not age well.”\u0026nbspMr Voronezhtsev says\u0026nbspit is\u0026nbsp“sad” that Belarusian authorities pressed ahead with the project given the sensitivity of the issue locally. There is\u0026nbspno obvious justification for a power station given that Belarus had no need for extra capacity, he adds.\u0026nbspBelarus says the power station will be used to meet domestic power needs. But it seems likely that part of the initial plan was to sell electricity to neighbouring Baltic countries, which remain plugged into the Russian grid. A decision by Lithuania to outlaw buying “dirty” electricity from the plant has undermined such rationale.\u0026nbspInstead, the project looks set to pull Minsk ever closer into Moscow’s embrace. Russia is providing the bulk of the financing for Astravets’ £8bn price tag, will be the sole supplier of fuel\u0026nbspand will deal with the radioactive waste.\u0026nbspThe power station plans were signed in a different era, at a time before Russia had expanded its military, annexed Crimea\u0026nbspor pushed Belarus along a path of forced deep integration. Now, such dependence is taking on a different significance.“This is part of a much larger game,” says\u0026nbspUlasevich. “The aim is to develop reliance in all the countries of Moscow’s immediate geography –\u0026nbspwhether by gas, oil or Rosatom. Belarus has simply sleepwalked into the trap.”\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I was shocked by that.It is a magnet for paedophiles because its not policed and anyone can sign up for it.If kids on there are not savvy enough, they will respond to people trying to engage in conversation with them.I see it as a direct way for people of that nature to get in because its not secure in anyway.She added: I cant see how they can police it.Luckily myself and my husband have quite a good relationship with our daughter, who is , and she often sits with me and I have a look at these things on TikTok.Some of the things people on there are doing are very inappropriate...girls that are around our daughters age.In another video, of a young girl stretching, one disturbing  user wrote: Who  got repetitive strain injury of the thumb trying to pause this Another said: You are so f***ing cute.In another video showing two young girls on a bed, one person wrote: You both could get it while another said: I could treat you right.In another video, a creepy user wrote: Whyd you pull your top up for!!!   Meanwhile one user told a girl: I would love for us to get together soon I will be Santa and you Mrs Clause...oh by the way Im Luke.TikTok, which has been downloaded more than a billion times in  countries, is labelled on the app store as being for those aged  and over. But its simple for users to lie about their age.Once logged in with an account, users can then post videos of themselves which are broadcast to other people - any of whom can then message the person directly.Emily Steers and Lauren Kearns, from Northamptonshire, are both  years old. Together, they run a TikTok channel with more than a million followers.Emilys dad Mark said: [Some of the messages] are a bit worrying. When they do catch people saying bad things or sexual things, they [TikTok] should have the power to block them or actually take them away straightaway.Another concerned parent, Nigel Wharton, said: I checked my  year old sons account and found five private messages from adults...one telling him they love him.I reported all of them, took screen shots and deleted the app. Be very careful parents.Meanwhile gran Michaela Clark, , from Derbyshire, was shocked when she learned her granddaughter Grace, ten, had been groomed on the site.She told the Sun Online: She’d been entering private chats with someone who’d claimed to have known her.He threatened to come to her house and take hershe didnt do certain things.“It just makes you want to scream out to people. What appears to be an innocent site where she’s making music videos and sending them to her friends is a site with nasty people on.Graces mum Jemma was horried. It’s really, really sad. It needs highlighting to everyone out there.TikTok, which is run by a seven-year-old company in Beijing called ByteDance, allows people to create short, snappy videos and share them around the world.Its only been going in its current format for  years, but its already available in more than  countries and has been downloaded more than  million times in the last year.A month after it launched, it surpassed Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and SnapChat in monthly installs.TikTok user Liz W, , who goes by the name @bitheoji on the app, explained how the app plays into the hands of predators.She said: If some creepy guy just keeps liking videos of younger girls doing similar audios or soundtracks or hashtags, those are going to keep coming up on his For You page.So its easier for him to find more victims. And I think thats what makes it so easy for predators to come on it and victimise young children.The French vlogger Le Roi des Rats said predators do not hide at all.He said: When a young girl dances in skimpy clothes or imitates sexy dances, you’re sure to find people in the comments either asking them to continue making these kinds of videos, saying they’re sexy or asking for their Snapchat or DM [to direct message]. Some of these girls are not even ten years old.Campaigners have also warned of the risks of young people falling prey to paedophiles on the app.Andy Burrows, NSPCC head of child safety online policy, told the Sun Online: Serious questions need to be asked about TikToks moderation practicesusers are able to freely post sexually suggestive comments to children.This is exactly the sort of content which needs to be targeted and removed but clearly that is not happening.Social media self-regulation has demonstrably failed and its time for the new Government to urgently bring in laws that force s to have a legal duty to keep children safe.Javed Khan, chief executive of Barnardos, said: Without the right security settings, children broadcasting live video of themselves in their bedrooms over the internet could be targeted by abusers.John Carr, one of the UKs leading experts on child online safety, warned: Theres no question an app like this is a magnet for paedophiles.Last month -year-old girl Lakerika McNeal, from Memphis, Tennessee, went missing after leaving her house to meet with a man she met on TikTok.Meanwhile the Wall Street Journal reported that ISIS militants were posting twisted jihadi propaganda on the site.The now-removed videos featured corpses being paraded through streets, IS singalongs and fighters posing with guns, all aimed at enlisting impressionable youngsters.In response, the app said safety was its top priority.A spokesman told the Sun Online: We have investigated the comments and swtly removed those that violated our community guidelines.We deploy a combination of policies, technologies and moderation strategies to detect and review problematic content and comments and implement appropriate penalties.We have also introduced a range of measures to better safeguard our users, including: comment filtering to allow users to choose and automatically hide certain words from appearing in their comments prompting users under  to make their account private at set-up and enabling users to make their account private at any time.We also encourage users to report any inappropriate content they see on the  using our reporting .While these protections wont catch all instances of misuse, were committed to improving and enhancing our protective measures and using learnings like these to continuously hone our moderation efforts.Can I prevent my teen from downloading TikTok TikTok have given the app a + store rating which allows parents to use device-based parental controls to block apps from an underage child’s phone.Please see the Apple App Store or Google Play Store instructions for more on parental controls and how to enable them.How can my teen control who sees their videos and sends them messages Users can control who can see their uploaded content, follow them, and send them messages by making their account private.

They were not born royal. But what is also notable is that it won’t stop the Americans using the titlethey wish to.When Edward married Wallis ­Simpson she didn’t get an HRH yet she was still sometimes referred to in America as HRH.I’m not saying it will happen on this occasion but it is possible as it sits quite nicely with Duke and Duchess.Harry is not using his HRH  because it would be a conflict of interest should he decide to embark on ­commercial enterprises.Harry knows full well that it is wrong to trade on your name.I don’t think not using it will have an impact. It didn’t affect Diana’s global appeal one bit. And Fergie had less of a profile but still made money.The Queen is pragmatic. She will be sad, too. She is very sensitive to Harry and his needs.

She knew he was an admirer of beautul women.”Ivanov later revealed: “I’d gone to his house to visit his we Valerie. She was happy to see me.“Twice she left me alone in her husband’s study, quite long enough to photograph secret stuff. It was such classied material it should have been locked in a safe.“Valerie showed no concern leaving me alone in the study, which was along from the master bedroom.”As a member of the Cabinet Defence Committee, Profumo — who died in  aged  — was privy to top military secrets.He had been instrumental in Britain getting the submarine-launched Polaris nuclear missile system from America.He also had knowledge of plans to arm West Germany with nuclear weapons and to allow America to establish bases in Scotland, from where nuclear submarines carrying Polaris missiles would operate.In Profumo’s study Ivanov found a treasure trove of Britain’s Cold War secrets and photographed the documents with a tiny Minox camera.Teenager Christine had been introduced to -year-old Profumo by osteopath Stephen Ward, a Soviet mole.In a newly discovered tape recorded in  but released to The Sun yesterday, she revealed: “Stephen said Eugene had gone round to Jack’s house to get his leg over with Valerie.“He might have been joking but I know Eugene went round there when Jack wasn’t home — he was with me.“I don’t knowEugene and she had drinks or something  but he spent time there, as I did.“Stephen and Eugene were very happy after the visits to Nash House.”At  Kensington Gardens, the London headquarters of Soviet military intelligence group GRU, Ivanov put together a package of highly sensitive material for his bosses in Moscow that he had obtained by duping Profumo’s we.He sent blueprints of the X-, an experimental high-altitude hyper- sonic aircraft, as well as operational inform- ation which revealed sites of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe.With the documents stolen during Ivanov’s visits to Valerie, the Russians planned to blackmail Profumo into revealing all the secrets he had access to as Minister for War in Harold Macmillan’s government.According to Ivanov’s close friend Gennady Sokolov, the Soviets believed they would have even more leverage against Profumo because they had also compromised his we, who died in November , aged .When they had married in , actress Valerie Hobson was a household name.She had starred in more than  films, including The Bride Of Frankenstein with Boris Karloff and Werewolf Of London, where her screams were so blood-curdling that Universal Pictures kept the recordings to use in other movies.While filming  melodrama Blanche Fury she had an affair with her leading man Stewart Granger, who described Valerie as “hotter than a scalded cat”.Ivanov’s pal Sokolov claims the Russians also had Profumo’s love letters to Christine.They had been “stolen” from Ward’s home, along with photos of Profumo and Christine making love in bed.Ivanov said: “Moscow Centre had all they needed for their operation against Profumo — enough, they believed, to turn to him as a source for vital information.“They had to add only the finishing touches, which meant one of our agents approaching Profumo with the compromising material.“Only two or three at the top of our intelligence service knew of the plan. The secret documents I had stolen from the desk at his home was the bonus, explosive ammunition.”As viewers saw in last night’s episode, Stephen Ward was put in the dock after the Profumo scandal erupted in .Profumo resigned in shame before he could be blackmailed by Ivanov’s spymasters. By then Ivanov had fled to Moscow, where the Soviets treated him as a hero — but his we walked out over his cheating.Back behind the Iron Curtain, Ivanov worked with Sokolov who he had met during spy training, on writing a bombshell book, Number One Spy, in which he revealed  the truth of his role in Profumo’s downfall.Christine, who died in  aged , always said the sex with The Raven was brief and fumbled.Ivanov’s book was a huge hit when it was published in Russia in the early s.But Sokolov has confirmed to The Sun that Ivanov was leaned on by the British establishment not to reveal in the UK edition how he had seduced Valerie into unwittingly giving him access to national secrets.He said: “There were censorship cuts concerning Ivanov’s dates with Mrs Profumo in July . I couldn’t publish them in Britain.”In January , less than two years after his book’s publication, Ivanov died, aged , in mysterious circumstances amid rumours that he was poisoned by rogue KGB agents.Before he died he also told Sokolov that he had compromising photographs and film of members of Britain’s Royal Family, material held in a red box which he had smuggled out of the UK.Today that material is said to sit in a safe at the Lubyanka, the former security agency headquarters in Moscow, along with Profumo’s love letters and sex photos.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I know I haven’t always gotten it right, but as far as this goes, there really was no other option.”The Duke claimed he wasnt walking away from the Royal Family but it wasnt possible to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth and the Military without public funding.He also expressed sorrow that his military titles had been taken away from him.He said: “Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth, and my military associations, but without public funding. Unfortunately, that wasn’t possible.”In a min sec speech at the Cha event, he added: “The UK is my home and a place that I love. That will never change. We both do everything we can to fly the flag and carry out our roles for this country with pride.“Once Meghan and I were married, we were excited, we were hopeful, and we were here to serve.Making a point of his new non-royal status, he said: “I want you to hear the truth from me, as much as I can share — not as a Prince, or a Duke, but as Harry.”He stressed: “It has been our privilege to serve you, and we will continue to lead a le of service. I will always have the utmost respect for my grandmother, my commander in chief, and I am incredibly grateful to her and the rest of my family, for the support they have shown Meghan and I over the last few months.I will continue to be the same man who holds his country dear and dedicates his le to supporting the causes, charities and military communities that are so important to me.He referenced his mum Princess Diana as he said: “I have grown up feeling support from so many of you, and I watched as you welcomed Meghan with open arms as you saw me find the love and happiness that I had hoped for all my le. Finally, the second son of Diana got hitched, hooray!”But Prince Harry last night faced flak for overshadowing the charity event, for his HIV charity Sentebale, to talk about his and Meghan’s personal issues.It followed his emotional outburst while touring South Africa, which took attention away from his charitable work. Last night’s speech was thought to be Harry’s last public appearance before flying to Canada this week to be reunited with Meghan and son Archie. Patrons of his charity were left gobsmacked by his speech, which ended when he introduced a performance by Scottish singer Lewis Capaldi.Mark Dyer, who was was today revealed to be one of baby Archies mystery godparents alongside the Dukes former nanny Tiggy Petter, was among the people in the restaurant to hear the speech.Socialite Tamara Beckwith, who rose to fame in the s as an IT girl alongside the late-Tara Palmer Tomkinson, was also seen arriving at the restaurant.In the deeply personal statement, Harry also revealed his son Archie - who is in Canada with we Meghan - had seen snow for the first time there.He said: He thought it was bloody brilliant.The speech happened as it was reported that Prince Charles is planning to review son Harry and Meghan’s leaving deal within a year over fears their proposed lestyle would cost too much.Sources told the Daily Mail the pair hope to make a fortune by setting up their own company to provide voiceovers and documentaries on “worthy issues”.Netflix executive Ted Sarandos has said the streaming giant would like to work with Harry and Meghanthey ventured into film and TV.It was reported last night that concerns from senior royals over the Sussexes’ commercial deals led to them being told they had to completely step away from official duties.Harry and Meghan have the potential to become a billion-dollar brand — even without their HRH titles, a top celebrity agent has claimed.Jonathan Shalit said the Sussexes could rake in hundreds of millions of pounds by signing deals with the world’s biggest corporations, such as Disney and Netflix.He added: “Even though they can’t use their HRH title, in the eyes of the world they will always be royal.”Interviews and book deals would also be a huge earner for the pair, he predicted.Mr Shalit said: “Imagine Oprah Winfrey interviewing Meghan on Apple, Amazon Prime or Netflix. She could get million for that.”This comes after his grandmother pulled no punches with a hardline Megxit deal meaning he and Meghan will now simply known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex after being forced to drop their Royal Highness titles.And Her Majesty laid down the law on Saturday - saying they can no longer formally represent her despite the couple having insisted they wanted to fly the flag for the Queen after quitting the Firm.In the decisive statement, the -year-old monarch also revealed the couple would pay back the £.m of taxpayer money spent on refurbishing Frogmore Cottage.And the Queen appeared in good spirits yesterday morning as she arrived for church at Sandringham with son Prince Andrew - her aides having struck a deal just days after she sat down with Prince Harry in crunch talks.Under the new deal, Harry and Meghan will retain their HRH status — but agreed to not use their titles while trying to forge a new le in North America.It means Harry has now been brought down to the level of  other Dukes in the UK.One royal expert last night described the incredible Megxit deal as an “abdication” and said the Queen “has brought down the iron fist of monarchical leadership”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She should have asked herselfshe was willing and able to behave in accordance with the expectations.Her Majesty’s words show great diplomacy but Meghan’s behaviour has so far not been diplomatic. A diplomat wouldn’t fall out with her own family.Her friends leaked negative comments about the “toxic” Royal Family. She also allowed damage to be done against our family via friends and PR advisers.She watched the media taunt and torture my dad, never springing to his defence like a true humanitarian would.Thomas was an incredible dad. He paid every penny of her education and cared greatly for her.He is now frail, with a heart condition. He doesn’t have a PR team to spin him a good story.The Queen, at , shouldn’t have had to face the stress of seeing her family torn apart.Meghan hasn’t stepped forward to minimise the damage.She knows how Harry leaving has affected them, but she hasn’t spoken up in their defence.Yet in her statement, the Queen says she is “particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family”.Her Majesty is building bridges there. It would be goodMeghan could do the same.She could have expressed her thanks for the kindness of the Queen and Prince Charles.She could have expressed gratitude to her own father or her first husband, Trevor, who gave her career opportunities.My sister has become a totally dferent person, choosing wealth and fortune over family.Her decision to leave is nothing to do with the behaviour of the royals, or race.Her marriage to Prince Harry was so symbolic of ethnic unity.The preacher and choir were all of African heritage. It was a lovely joining together.The royals embraced that. They welcomed Meghan into their lives, into the culture, and allowed her to promote people of all races. I have never heard anything racist coming out of the Windsors about my sister.Supporters who claim a racist element forced Meghan out are frustrated their hoped-for fairytale princess didn’t work out.These social equality-obsessed people had pinned their hopes on Meghan. They hoped for an equality of race right at the higher echelons of society.At least Harry and Meghan were right to decide tothe £.million they received to renovate Frogmore Cottage and not take any more public funds.In the Queen’s statement, she hopes Meghan and Harry can “start building a happy and peaceful le”. We have to hope for the sake of my sister and for the Royal Family that this agreement achieves that aim.My fear is Meghan’s decision isn’t about moving to Canada for a quiet le as a young mother.Nothing about their actions so far suggest they truly desire a private le out the limelight.They have paraded themselves on the red carpet, tried to make deals with Disney, and become pals with the Clooneys and other A-list stars.Smooching up to Vogue magazine, to fashion and to the film industry is not consistent with taking a step back.Their objective is fame and fortune — to be Hollywood.Meghan’s goals are not consistent with those of the Royal Family. Personally, I don’t believe she ever expected to fit in with the strict structures and traditions of the Windsor household.Even after marrying she kept her lawyer and publicity adviser, suggesting she wasn’t willing to sever her ties with her old le.Perhaps she always had the idea toto her le as an actress and lestyle influencer.In the statement from Buckingham Palace, it says “the Sussexes have made clear everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty”.My concern is that this is a face-saving statement, which won’t work in reality. The Royal Family has always been opposed to merchandising and corporate endeavours outside of them.If Meghan and Harry want to honour the Queen, they will consult her before doing deals.She thinks she can be at the top of the world, but using the royals to get that international notoriety is tacky.Meghan was a cable TV actress before marrying Harry and would not be on the front of every newspaper and magazine without him.In the US, the Press is still positive, praising her attempts to modernise the British monarchy and saying how cool she is.The media in Calornia and New York are likely to remain in her corner but I don’t think Meghan and Harry will ever be able to overshadow Prince William and his we Catherine.They are exemplary they are iconic. There is no comparison.It is clear Meghan cares for Archie, but I do worry about his future. There doesn’t seem to have been a lot of consideration given to his cousins George, Charlotte and Louis and how often he will see them. Harry has put Meghan above his brother, father and grandmother. A house ided cannot stand.I am worried that Meghan and Harry will never find true ­happiness. They could not find contentment with the Royal Family, will they be able to find it away from them Maybe they will meet up with counsellors who can help them to heal the wounds.Perhaps they will make amends by apologising.We need sincerity and dignity from Meghan in order to find peace. Then, perhaps, she will have the peace she needs to go forward.I loved my sister, but I do not like the person she has become.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We like — we love — our Queen here in Britain.But we are not prepared to pay the way for her multi-millionaire grandson — £million inheritance from his mum and £million from the Queen Mum —he no longer wishes to be a full-time royal.There is no royal halfway house — no one foot in, one foot out — as Her Majesty has rightly agreed.So yes, we want back the £.million we spent on the renovations of a “cottage” which he will seldom live in. So far, so good.But there are problems with this deal, some of which may well come back to bite Buckingham ­Palace and its push for a “hard Megxit”.Harry, a -year-old married father, is still taking money from his dad’s Duchy of Cornwall estate, despite his stated desire to live a financially independent le. This turbo-charged pocket money amounts to over £million a year at present.Traditionally, the sons of the heirs to the throne rely on the Duchy to fund their lives while they go about their royal duties, but without those duties Harry no longer needs to rely on the Bank of Dad.If the Prince of Wales chooses to fund his son and Meghan, it is his choice. But he will only do it in an attempt to maintain some necessary control over their expenditure. This is problematic for free-spirited Harry — and Charles, who will almost certainly not approve of everything this money is spent on.Sure, Harry and Meghan can make millions of dollars by lending their names to commercial ventures. But the Buckingham Palace statement says: “The Sussexes have made clear everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty.” What an alarmingly vague and woolly line.We can take a stab at what these values are — ask any good Christian. But how do they relate to commercial deals with huge American corporations For example, Harry has been touting Meghan for voiceover work with Disney.But which characters are brand-safe  Presumably Cruella de Vil is off limits And what about interviews  A big- money sit-down with a US network — their pal Oprah Winfrey would surely be first in line — would net a huge fee. But what can they say and still uphold the Queen’s values The world is interested in Meghan and Harry’s touchy-feely philanthropic endeavours, but what they really want is the juice. What’s it really like in the Royal Family  How they approach this is crucial.Arguably, they should never discuss the “family” on TV — the Queen does not. If they write books, it should not be about their personal experiences within the “family”. And any products from their brand should be unrelated to the Royal Family.If their money-making ventures are focused on the charities they support, they will be fine. Their new foundation could make them millions but while doing so make millions for their charities, too. This is how they could get away with it. But will this be enough for the ambitious Meghan  I somehow doubt it.However nice Her Majesty appears to be, she has given up her le and much of her personal happiness to do her duty and it is a new world for her to see her grandson no longer feels capable of doing the same — albeit in a much smaller way — himself.While incredibly astute, the deal is not what the Queen wanted. She would have preferred to keep them within the royal fold, but she does not want another Diana disaster. Diana knew the system was not hers to change, and it is not Harry and Meghan’s either. It belongs to the Queen.She tried to accommodate Diana within it. What the Queen could not do was to restructure the monarchy to suit her daughter-in-law. As she now can’t reconstruct the monarchy for her grandson and his we. So, she has asked them to step away.The last thing the Queen wanted was for it to look asthe Duke and Duchess of Sussex had been thrown out of the royal fold. Archie Mountbatten Windsor is her and Prince Philip’s eighth great-grandchild. His future is important to them as it might also embody a small part of the future of a modern monarchy. But how much of a royal this soon-to-be largely Canadian-bred lad will ever be remains to be seen. Not much, is the best bet.The Sussexes have what they want. They don’t want to be criticised for taking monies from the British taxpayer. They don’t want to be seen as taking advantage of the Queen’s kindness. And whatever other members of the Royal Family might think of them, and be disappointed by them, Harry is the son of the future King.So Her Majesty has accommodated them.

He warned the Left’s obsession is providing a cloak for crime.The Sussexes’ decision to quit was “not racism”, he told a cheering crowd. “We’re the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe.”Signicantly, the applause came not from the far Right but from right-on BBC Question Time — an audience carefully chosen, stressed presenter Fiona Bruce, to reflect Britain by age, sex and politics.Fox — famous as DS James Hathaway in TV’s Lewis — was instantly denounced as a “privileged white male” and therefore with no right to an opinion.“Oh, God!” he cried. “I can’t help what I am, I was born like this. It’s an immutable characteristic, so to call me a white privileged male is to be racist.”His landmark moment went viral.Ricky Gervais spoke for the silent majority when he told the Golden Globes nominees “who know nothing about the real world” to tear up their political speeches.But it took the furore over Megxit — and Fox’s unanswerable case for the defence — to trigger Britain’s own fightback.Fox has given a voice to ordinary, decent citizens who are incensed by finger-wagging know-alls smearing them as racists, Nazis and fascists.These ugly insults were hurled at millions who backed Brexit and the overwhelming majority who voted for Boris Johnson.Until now we’ve been too polite to fight back, gagged by Thought Police who bark: “You can’t say that.”So we put up with politically correct sniping from such “identity” obsessives as rapper Stormzy, MP Clive Lewis and the entire Labour Party, who smell racism under every rock.Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan sparked uproar when he challenged black and Asian commentators to produce a “shred of evidence” of Press racism. They failed.Fox’s one-man mission is more than a poke at the PC brigade. It is about free speech — and hypocrisy.Scattergun charges of racism offer an alibi to serious crime, he says, citing the Pakistani sex gangs who systematically raped and trafficked white victims across Britain — with police blessing.“It’s one of the dangerous things about throwing racism around,” the actor told Question Time.“People become so conscious of it that things like the Manchester grooming scandal get ignored.”He spoke as police finally confessed to deliberately turning a blind eye to decades-long vile abuse of vulnerable, underage white girls.A police report confirms a -year reign of sex abuse went unchecked after an unnamed chief inspector ruled: “With it being Asians, we can’t afford for this to be coming out.”Fear of the race card also partly explains why police failed to halt the slaughter of mostly black victims by mostly black kne gangs.The same “cultural cringe” stops prison staff tackling dangerous Islamist gangs who have seized control in Britain’s terror jails.It’s why forced marriage and honour killings go unchecked.Now, at last, black and Asian voices are bravely confronting the race zealots.Leading commentator and ex-Equality Commissioner Trevor Phillips, son of poor immigrants, condemns “feel- good” racism detectorists.“It might make ‘right-on’ white liberals feel better,” he says. “But the price of their smugness is an ongoing bloody massacre of black children.”Home Secretary Priti Patel, daughter of Uganda-Indian migrants, has declared war on the race industry.The BBC strenuously denies “institutional bias”, despite abundant evidence from within the Beeb itself – including from former Director-General Mark Thompson.Now Boris Johnson is in power and the bloated corporation’s £BILLION subsidy is at risk.Perhaps that’s why Question Time is now apparently balanced, Andrew Marr is being polite to Tory guests and on Radio ’s Today, Nick Robinson has gone almost silent.“We live in a great country, a land of opportunity for all,” she said. “Institutionalised, corrosive behaviour that disregards victims has to end.“Tackling this abuse is a priority for the Home Office. There will be no no-go areas.”At last, perhaps, we have a senior politician of colour who is prepared to follow Laurence Fox’s advice and “speak truth to nonsense”.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That will never change.I have grown up feeling support from so many of you, and I watched as you welcomed Meghan with open arms as you saw me find the love and happiness that I had hoped for all my le. Finally, the second son of Diana got hitched, hurray!I also know youve come to know me well enough over all these years to trust that the woman I chose as my we upholds the same values as I do. And she does, and shes the same woman I fell in love with.We both do everything we can to fly the flag and carry out our roles for this country with pride.Once Meghan and I were married, we were excited, we were hopeful, and we were here to serve.For those reasons, it brings me great sadness that it has come to this.The decision that I have made for my we and I to step back is not one I made lightly. It was so many months of talks after so many years of challenges.

Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth, and my military associations, but without public funding. Unfortunately, that wasnt possible.Ive accepted this, knowing that it doesnt change who I am or how committed I am.But I hope that helps you understand what it had come to, that I would step my family back from all I have ever known, to take a step forward into what I hope can be a more peaceful le.I was born into this le, and it is a great honour to serve my country and the Queen.When I lost my mum  years ago, you took me under your wing.Youve looked out for me for so long, but the media is a powerful force, and my hope is one day our collective support for each other can be more powerful because this is so much bigger than just us.It has been our privilege to serve you, and we will continue to lead a le of service.It has also been a privilege to meet so many of you, and to feel your excitement for our son Archie, who saw snow for the first time the other day and thought it was bloody brilliant!I will always have the utmost respect for my grandmother, my commander in chief, and I am incredibly grateful to her and the rest of my family for the support they have shown Meghan and I over the last few months.I will continue to be the same man who holds his country dear and dedicates his le to supporting the causes, charities and military communities that are so important to me.Together, you have given me an education about living.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailNews stories about department stores closing are so common now that it’s easy to become numb to the pain of it. Yet for the thousands of shop workers facing redundancy across the  outlets of Beales, one of the UK’s oldest department stores, the pain is all too real. For them, these shops provide the jobs that put dinner on the table and clothes on their children’s backs. They are vital sources of prosperity, attracting people into town and supporting other businesses to thrive. And they’re sources of hope as well, giving people a real sense of belonging to the places where they live.With the threat of closure looming, Beales is the latest casualty of the crisis gripping our high streets. For the many communities around the country struggling to maintain their dignity despite year upon year of neglect, it’s a crisis that cuts deep. Almost  years ago to the day, Woolworths – one of the UK’s most iconic high street brands – closed with the loss of , jobs and scores more in the supply chain. It was the start of a decade of store closure after store closure. And just like so many of our homegrown industries that have experienced crises, the government makes plenty of noise but continues to let one of the most important industries in our economy wither away. It’s a serious dereliction of duty. For the sake of the three million people who work in retail, and for the countless others who look to their high streets for a sense of pride about where they live, we urgently need to get a grip on this crisis. First and foremost, that means overhauling the business rates system so high street shops aren’t unfairly penalised compared to online retailers. Amazon pays just .% of its turnover in business rates, a drop in the ocean compared to what high street shops have to pay. That simple injustice is ripping the heart out of our towns. Business rates should also more closely match the local economic reality. What we tax is even more important than how much we tax and land value has far exceeded wage growth in the last ten years, so a fair rating system should reflect the widest possible set of economic factors including average local income. Secondly, we have to start treating retail as the hugely important industry it is. We all use shops nearly every day, and retail is the UK’s largest private sector employer. It’s a massive part of our economy, so why don’t we invest more in it  That means a serious skills strategy including higher-quality apprenticeships and co-ordinated training to harness new technology so it benefits workers. Thirdly,we are going to use the levers of government to revitalise the retail sector then we need the retail sector to behave responsibly. That means higher pay and an end to zero hours contracts. Retail staff should not be seen as shop-floor fodder but valued employees with an important contribution to make to the success of businesses. Finally, let’s recognise the deep attachment communities have to their high streets and insist they’re involved when it comes to making decisions about the future. Every town in the country is full of people with exciting ideas grounded in deep knowledge of the places where they live. Yet the process of planning and development goes on asthey don’t exist. We need to ensure that community groups have a seat at the table when local plans are drawn up.

We must reboot and renew Britain or we risk losing it. “An outdated institution  miles or so north of its current location is still an outdated institution.” Mr Brown will call for a UK-wide constitutional convention and regional citizens’ assemblies to gauge public opinion.He will suggest setting up a Forum of the Nations and Regions to prevent a centralisation of power in London after Brexit . This could then form the basis for a new second chamber that would ultimately replace the House of Lords. The Labour heavyweight also wants the Treasury to hand over powers over allocation of regional spending to local authorities, mayors and MPs sitting on a “Northern Exchequer” board.  “On vital issues, outlying regions and communities will no longer be governed simply by dictates from London second guessing what they want,” he will say.   “The demand for more power to the North is far greater than can be met by gimmicks or gestures given that the UK is a unitary state but a multinational country that it is asymmetric with  per cent of the votes at elections in England and that political, financial and administrative power has been over-concentrated in one city in the South.” The speech at a Hope Not Hate event in Westminster comes after it emerged Mr Johnson was considering moving  peers permanently to York in a major sht of British political gravity. Under the plans, the House of Commons would also go on tour - holding debates in cities outside of London.  York, sometimes referred to as “the capital of the North”, is reportedly the preferred option but Birmingham is also in the running. The exact location would be decided by a constitutional review, announced in the Tory manesto and launched in the Spring, which would also look at the powers and role of the Supreme Court and Lord Chancellor. Tory party chairman James Cleverly confirmed the government was considering moving the House of Lords to a Northern city. Disused government-owned land close to York railway station has already been identied as a potential site.  He told Sky’s Sophy Ridge programme: “What we are looking at is a whole range of options about making sure every part of the UK feels properly connected from politics.  “When the PM stood up the day after the election and said this is going to be the people’s government he meant it. That meant connecting people with government and politics.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boy 6 healthy two years","story":"NewsBoy, , who was healthy two years ago now in constant pain and cant speakBlake Hostick was diagnosed with Acute Necrotising Encephalopathy- which causes the bodys defences turn against themselves and attack, causing swelling in the brain and spinal cordShare - which causes the bodys defences turn against themselves and attack, causing swelling in the brain and spinal cord\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Blake--told-hes-got-a-stomach-bug-but-is-now-on-le-support-with-incredibly-rare-brain-diseas.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\" - which causes the bodys defences turn against themselves and attack, causing swelling in the brain and spinal cord\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Blake--told-hes-got-a-stomach-bug-but-is-now-on-le-support-with-incredibly-rare-brain-diseas.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\" - which causes the bodys defences turn against themselves and attack, causing swelling in the brain and spinal cord\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Blake--told-hes-got-a-stomach-bug-but-is-now-on-le-support-with-incredibly-rare-brain-diseas.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\" - which causes the bodys defences turn against themselves and attack, causing swelling in the brain and spinal cord\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Blake--told-hes-got-a-stomach-bug-but-is-now-on-le-support-with-incredibly-rare-brain-diseas.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\" - which causes the bodys defences turn against themselves and attack, causing swelling in the brain and spinal cord\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Blake--told-hes-got-a-stomach-bug-but-is-now-on-le-support-with-incredibly-rare-brain-diseas.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\" - which causes the bodys defences turn against themselves and attack, causing swelling in the brain and spinal cord\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Blake--told-hes-got-a-stomach-bug-but-is-now-on-le-support-with-incredibly-rare-brain-diseas.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\" - which causes the bodys defences turn against themselves and attack, causing swelling in the brain and spinal cord\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Blake--told-hes-got-a-stomach-bug-but-is-now-on-le-support-with-incredibly-rare-brain-diseas.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"CommentsBySophie Corcoran:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsBlake was told he had a stomach bug before being diagnosed with a rare brain disease \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Blake Hostick was diagnosed with Acute Necrotising Encephalopathy- which causes the bodyaposs defences turn against themselves and attack, causing swelling in the brain and spinal cord. It affects only around  people in the world. Now, his parents, from Hull, East Yorks, are fundraising for a special suit designed to help Blake live pain-free. Stepdad Joseph Dowel said: Just two years ago, Blake was a perfectly normal, healthy four-year-old boy. Now heaposs severely disabled - he can only take a few steps as long as we hold him up, he has most of his diet through a feeding tube, he canapost speak. When he was just four years old, after his family noticed he was unwell, doctors said Blake had a stomach virus and he was sent home. However, Blakeaposs illness became worse over the next two days, and on the second night after being sent home he became violently sick. The next morning his mum, Kirsty Hostick, called for an ambulance and he was rushed to Hull Royal Infirmary. It was thought it was dehydration from the virus, but he soon started to lose his sight and by the time the family got to hospital, he could not move, see or hear and he eventually became unresponsive. A day later he was transferred to Sheffield Childrenaposs Centreaposs intensive care unit and put on le support. Numerous tests showed he had Flu B in his blood, the cause of ANE. It can cause severe brain damage and carries only a % survival rate and only a % recovery rate, reports Hull Live.  Blake spent five months in hospital in Sheffield before travelling to a specialist rehabilitation centre in Surrey, called The Childrenaposs Trust. The family raised funds at the time to allow Blakes brothers, Kayleb, eight, and Haydon, , to visit him at the weekends. Ashley Buck, who is raising money to buy a special suit to help improve Blakeaposs experience with the condition, said the little boy is in constant pain and cannot sleep due to muscle spasms. In October last year, Blakeaposs stepfather, Joseph Dowell told  how the family is grieving for him. He said: Itaposs taken away everything from him. Weaposve just battled and battled from when he was in his coma, to when they told us the worst could be real. You have to go on to have blind faith and weaposve never stopped. But awareness of it is absolutely key. Kirsty and Joseph have recently announced a new arrival to their family and they are still driven by the hope of getting Blake back and are fueled by steps in his recovery that could be more common with the help of the Molli suit that Ashley is fundraising for.  The Molli suit is designed to generate a small electrical current to reduce spasticity in Blakeaposs muscles which will reduce his pain and help him sleep and move more easily. The idea to help the family came after Ashley, , from North Ferriby, stepped down from the Humber Rescue team and got in touch with the Le For A Kid charity. He said: I used to do Humber Rescue and did a lot of fundraising with them. Iaposm out at the moment with a back injury and stood down and was looking at dferent charities to seethere was anything I could do. I got in contact with Le For A Kid as I wanted to do something positive and spoke to Dean Hoggard there. I work at Siemens and five of us wanted to do the Leeds Half Marathon and we spoke to Dean who mentioned the Molli suit. Blakeaposs family have already got some money put aside for operations but the suit will help send currents to stop the pain in his muscles and help them relax. He is in pain all of the time because of the muscle spasms. Ashley will join forces with Ryan Williams, George Grassby, Rich Ashbridge and Wayne Stewart to run the Leeds Half Marathon in May this year.

The homeowners, named as Mr and Mrs Hyam, built a side extension to their house which was just four inches shorter than the height of the bungalow. But the councilaposs regulations state extensions must be at least nine inches shorter than the original building. The extension is also greater than two thirds the width of the original building, again contravening Warwick District Councilaposs regulations. Councillors on the planning committee turned down the homeownersapos application to alter the conditions by five votes to four, meaning the roof will have to be rebuilt. Planning officers explained that permission for the semi-detached property, in Penns Close, Cubbington, Warks., had been granted as the plans had been amended to adhere to the councilaposs Residential Design Guide . A report to the meeting explained: The RDG states that in order to appear as subservient additions, side extensions should not be greater than two thirds of the width of the original dwelling house. There should also be a set down of the roof ridge of a minimum of mm . The side extension as approved is greater than two thirds the width of the original dwelling.  Therefore the key factor in ensuring a subservient design was the previously approved mm set down. Councillors were told the set down - or dference in roof heights - was just mmso the extension failed to meet the guidelines. There had been five letters of support for the application to alter the conditions and Debbie Jones, speaking on behalf of the applicants Mr and Mrs Hyam, said it was a minor discrepancy and was a technical issue that arose during construction. But while councillors were sympathetic to the owners, they refused to give any leeway which will mean the roof having to be rebuilt.

Those who live Pitmeadow House, Druids Heath, say windows are smashed aposfor funapos and children are told to hold their breath as they enter smoke-filled lts. One single mum told BirminghamLive: We found faeces on the stairs, we didnapost knowit was dog or human - we donapost ask questions round here. The levels of anti-social behaviour at the tower block are at such a high level that the council has had to issues warnings to residents not to spit, smoke in lts or defecate in corridors. Parents often find their pushchairs blocked by bags of rubbish and human spit often covers the buttons in the lt. Struggling families say the block is a disgusting and terrying place but they have nowhere  to go. Sonia Jackson was homeless and facing le on the streets with her son before the council found them a flat but she was quickly warned about the block. When I mentioned where I was moving, they said it was the worst one on the estate, she said. We always joke once youaposre in, youaposre not getting out.

There is normally rubbish everywhere, all in the lt too. The caretakers come once or twice a day, but they shouldnapost have to. Speaking about when the hallway is vandalised, she said: This is where all the kids come to smoke when itaposs raining. Itaposs when people start smashing windows. Last year all these windows were put through, she gestures to the main entrance where thereaposs a dozen or so windows. They smashed all the lights too, it was petrying. My son was so scared, it was awful, especially when you hear all the bangs and everything. We have had all sorts. My brother came and visited me and was mortied to find faeces on the stairs.  Sonia says she wonapost press the buttons in the lt and the common areas often smell. Me and my son use our coats or keys to press the buttons in the lt, because they spit on them, Sonia said. You get a lot of spitting, the fact that you need a sign inside to tell you not to spit, says it all. My son struggles with the smell and the sights here. It stinks of majuana. The smell fills your flat so much that some of the girls on my course ask me: aposwhataposs that smell apos I say, aposItaposs not me, I donapost smoke it I swear, it just clings to my coatapos.  Along with council notices urging residents not to spit, the noticeboard featured a scathing letter from another resident - who branded their own block as a f*** place full of f***** tramps. It has since been taken down but it read: This f*** place is a joke. Rubbish either on landings or in the lts or on the stairs. AINapost you f***** tramps got no general hygiene. Sort ya f***** s*** out man. Another mum said: Thereaposs a lot of drug dealers around. Itaposs a bad area. You canapost find any worse unfortunately. They fill the lt with smoke, it takes ten minutes to clear the smoke and the smell. My son says to me aposmum it smellsapos, I have to tell him to hold his breath when weaposre going downstairs. She claims sheaposs also been pestered for sex: Once a man asked mehe could come home with me, he kept asking and asking. I said no, I have children in my home.

Prince Harry and Meghan married in May  and it was assumed the couple would call the UK home. The Queen gted the couple Frogmore Cottage in Windsor as their marital home, with a refurbishment to the property costing the UK taxpayer £. million. However, it now appears Meghan may never have fully committed to living in Britain full-time. It has now emerged that when the Duchess of Sussex left her home in Toronto where she had lived for seven years previously and where legal drama Suits was filmed, she left behind an entire wardrobe filled with her clothes. The shocking revelation suggests the former actress had always intended to spend a great deal of time in Canada, even before the couple announced their intention to step back earlier this month. Canada’s Entertainment Tonight TV channel reported that when Meghan moved to London in November  to live with Prince Harry, initially at Kensington Palace’s Nottingham Cottage, she packed up her clothes and put them into storage in Toronto for use at a later date. A signicant proportion of the clothes are thought to have been left behind and have now been shipped to the home they have rented on Vancouver Island. Some of the clothes Meghan left in Canada have been worn since herover the Christmas period, including a black cashmere beanie, a parka by Soia  Kyo, a Barbour “Epler” coat and the “Bea” cable knit sweater from The Row.  ET Canada’s online editor Jamie Samhan wrote: “While it was known the Duchess put her furniture into storage, it was said at the time she took all her personal items with her. “It also begs the question, did Meghan always plan on ing to North America in some capacity  Many have raised doubts around the step down of being senior royals and that both Prince Harry and Meghan had been planning this for some time. “The two did give the full royal le a go, but perhaps they always considered having a Canadian abode.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry find one part","story":"NewsHeartbreaking sacrice Prince Harry is having to make as part of Megxit dealPrince Harry and his we Meghan Markle will no longer use their HRH titles and willthe £.million of taxpayer funds used on the Frogmore Cottage renovationShareCommentsByKaisha Langton:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video harry-meghan-key-dates-megxit-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news prince-harry-find-one-part-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

As the deal about the Duke and Duchess of Sussexaposs future is thrashed out between the couple, the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William, part of the deal will include the loss of his official military appointments. These official military appointments include Captain General of Marines, Honorary Air Commandant Royal Air Force Honington, and Commodore-in-Chief of Small Ships and Diving. He and the Duchess of Sussex will also lose their appointments as Commonwealth Youth Ambassadors.From Spring, Harry and Meghan Markle will no longer be working members of the Royal Family, officially represent the Queen or use their HRH status. The Sussex pair will also no longer receive public funds for their work and willthe Sovereign Grant funds used for refurbishments to their Windsor home Frogmore Cottage last year.The couple will keep their private patronages and are expected to remain President and Vice President of The Queen’s Commonwealth Trust.The loss of these titles and appointments is likely to be a particularly dficult loss for the Prince Harry who often appeared at his happiest when serving in the army or spending time with fellow veterans.While working as a royal, he has also showed his passion for the army when he founded the Invictus Games, a competition for injured, sick and wounded Armed Forces personnel and veterans. During his military career, Harry, known as Captain Wales by his comrades, spent  years in the army during which time he undertook two operational tours of Afghanistan and qualied as an Apache helicopter commander While on his second tour of Helmand in , it is thought the youngest son of Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana found try contentment in living away from the pressures of royal le. He once told a fellow soldier: Iaposve got the best of both worlds. I get to do all this. I can fly helicopters. I can shine a spotlight on the work I want to do. Prince Harryaposs military career came to an end in June , but since that time he has remained a passionate advocate for the Armed Forces and has been bestowed a number of ceremonial military titles.

No longer senior royals, the couple have been granted their wish to turn their backs on Britain setting up their initial home in Canada. But behind Meghan’s kilowatt smile, the broad grins the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have recently lit up Vancouver Island with during their seven-week stay, belie the harsh reality Harry now faces. For according to the magazine Meghanaposs friends speak to, the Prince arrives in Canada “cut off” from many of the close pals he once cherished. People magazine claim about six months into Meghan‘s pregnancy with son Archie, the Prince left his circle of pals behind seeing him increasingly surrounded by his we’s friends.Most no longer even have his cell number,” a source told the respected magazine. “They totally understand that men often drt from their friends after marriage, but there’s still a lot of resentment because they had been so close for so long.” Now following Saturday’s announcement by the Queen, the Prince is due to arrive back on Vancouver Island this week to be reunited with his we and son to plan their new futures together. Before Harry and Meghan were the royal couple self-appointed to modernise the monarchy. But after “stepping back” from royal duties, the pair will today begin the arduous task of house hunting across the pond and finding schools Archie will one day attend. This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity, the couple wrote on their website.  On Saturday the Queen revealed that Harry and Meghan’s North American home would be in Canada. “There will be a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the UK,” reads the statement. The couple has made no secret of their love for the country. Meghan spoke about both the splendour of Canada and the warmth of its people following the coupleaposs Christmas break on Vancouver Island. “Just to be able to take in the warmth that we experienced from the people but also just to walk around and just see the beauty of Canada,” she said. “To see Archie go ‘ahhh’ when you walk by and just see how stunning it is, so it meant a lot to us.” Exactly where the Sussexes will live in Canada has yet to be announced publicly, but some locations are more likely than others.  Meghan is said to be particularly keen on Toronto, calling the city her “second home” after spending seven years there as she filmed the US legal drama Suits. Yesterday it emerged the Duchess had held clothes into storage in Toronto hinting she may have always held ambitions of ing to Ontario to one day live there again. Toronto has several well-heeled neighbourhoods including Forest Hill and Deer Park, where Meghan’s best friend Jessica Mulroney lives. Butthe couple is prepared to spend a chunk of their £ million fortune, the ultra-exclusive Bridle Path - dubbed Canada’s Beverly Hills - is where Harry and Meghan would rub shoulders with the A-listers they now appear to crave. Rapper Drake, singer Celine Dion and the late singer Prince all owned homes within the celebrity oasis. Toronto is also ideally placed to offer Archie an education steeped in British and royal heritage. The city’s Upper Canada College, a private boys’ school, is modelled on Eton - where Harry was educated. The Prince’s grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, has strong ties with the school being on its board of governors until he retired three years ago.  Boarding school Lakefield College in the province of Ontario is also an option. Harryaposs uncle Prince Andrew spent a year there in . Meghan is also well connected in Toronto previously being a staple of the city’s social elite. Although Harry has no known friends there, the Duchess is extremely close to Mulroney and her TV presenter husband Ben – son of former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Meghan is also close to Markus Anderson, who rose through the ranks at London’s Soho House hotel and members’ club before being sent by founder Nick Jones to open Toronto’s own venue. It was here he met Meghan and the two became firms friends. It was Anderson, now a close confidant and fixer for the Duchess, who introduced her to rich and powerful friends such as the Clooneys. Meghan once said of Toronto: “It’s really funny because I think as much of a big city as Toronto is, it’s so dferent from LA or New York. Thereno paparazzi, so it’s really easy to just have a normal le.”  Itaposs possible Meghan feels that Toronto could give her family that “space to focus on the next chapter,” as she and Harry put it in their announcement. But despite the lure of the Ontario city, speculation is mounting the couple could choose Canadaaposs Pacic west coast as their base. The Royals have spent the last seven weeks on Vancouver Island which boasts Pearson College as a possible school for Archie. The establishment is one of  schools and colleges around the world in the UWC movement, which was set up to promote the principles of peace and international understanding. Built on the shore, it has an ecological reserve and marina while its values are closely aligned to Harry and Meghan’s. The island would also ensure the couple the peace they value amid a backdrop of breathtaking scenery. Alongside the , sq ft £. million mansions they are currently staying in in North Saanich, they are surrounded by other millionaires and rich retirees who move to the Island for a quiet le. The couple could also move to the Vancouver on the mainland with them reportedly eyeing up a £ million home close to Kitsilano beach. Both Toronto and Vancouver have flourishing TV and film industries, which may well be a draw for Meghanshe wants toto acting or pursue a career as a director, as has been rumoured.  Industry tax breaks have seen both cities double their share of film locations for big-budget US movies and TV shows. But the Vancouver would also provide a perfect base for Meghan as it is only a three-hour plane ride to Los Angeles where she grew up and her mother, Doria Ragland, still lives. There she has assembled an elite Hollywood team she secretly retained throughout her time in the British royal family and who are now poring over a host of multi-million dollar offers. They include agent Nick Collins of The Gersh Agency, whose clients include Tobey Maguire and Jamie Foxx. He is handling lucrative film, TV and philanthropic offers and opportunities on behalf of the couple from around the world. Meghanaposs Beverly Hills business manager Andrew Meyer is also working behind the scenes planning her next major moves, while Hollywood power lawyer Rick Genow is also heavily involved. The team’s creation fuels rumour the Duchess’s ultimate dream is to move back to Calornia eventually but is claimed to be refusing to do so while Donald Trump is President.Los Angeles would also prove problematic in terms of the couple’s privacy as the city is the paparazzi capital of the world. America though, would place them closer to the Duchess’s business, Frim Fram Inc after she moved the firm to Delaware - a US state used by the super-rich to protect their interests from scrutiny.

The Queen was allegedly not pleased with the revamp to the historic cottage, which the couple were modernising with the intention of raising a family there. It has not been made clear how or over what time period the Sussexes intend to pay the signicant sum back or whether that was always the intention. However, Frogmore is likely to remain largely shut off with the pair planning a new le across the Atlantic.  A house manager and a cleaner are amongst at least two permanent staff members transferred to other duties in the Queenaposs household after Harry and Meghan revealed they would be leaving the UK. While other employees, including maids, footmen and chefs, were informed they would need to find new employment. The property was made into one single five-bedroom home rather than five separate cottages as it once was, with celebrity decorator Vicky Charles understood to have overseen the changes.  As part of their announcement to step down, the Sussexes said they plan to relinquish the Sovereign Grant, part of which was used to pay for the Frogmore work last year. The Sussexesapos new website, launched in line with their decision to step down, states that  per cent of their annual funding comes from the Duchy of Cornwall, the Prince of Wales’s private estate, estimated at around £.million. They are likely to make millions in commercial ventures abroad, however.  Harry spoke for the first time publicly about the reasons why he and Meghan decided to aposabdicateapos and move to Canada at a charity event over the weekend in The Ivy Club Cha. I know I haven’t always gotten it right, but as far as this goes, there really was no other option, he said. What I want to make clear is we’re not walking away, and we certainly aren’t walking away from you.  Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the commonwealth, and my military associations, but without public funding.  Unfortunately, that wasn’t possible. Speaking about what was planned after he married Meghan almost two years ago, he said: We both do everything we can to fly the flag and carry out our roles for this country with pride. Once Meghan and I were married, we were excited, we were hopeful, and we were here to serve.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex hope to make millions producing documentaries and giving voice-overs on worthy causes as they look to become financially independent after relinquishing public funding.  The couple, who announced two weeks ago their wish to step down as senior royals, are now free to strike lucrative contracts as they will no longer be serving the Queen. And Netflixaposs chief content officer Ted Sarandos was quick to confirm he would be interested in working with the soon-to-be former royals, who are apparently looking to emulate Barack and Michelle Obama. Harry has already contributed to a mental health series with pal Oprah Winfrey for Apple TV.However, the Sussexes have apparently given assurances to Her Majesty that all deals, including any with the streaming service, will be respectable of their royal connections, reports the Daily Mail .A source told the newspaper: The sorts of deals they will do will be more along the lines of the documentary series the duke is executive producing on mental health for Apple TV. It’s a new model, admittedly, but they are determined to prove to the family that this can work.  Given the duchess’s work [as an actress] before she married and the duke’s interests, it is likely that this is the route they want to go down.Wen asked about potentially working with the couple, Netflix boss Mr Sarandos said: Who wouldnapost be interested  Yes, sure.Issues the Sussexes are likely to focus their production work on include mental health and climate change.  This comes as Meghan has already agreed a deal with Disney for voiceover work, with profits to be given to an elephant charity. The duke and duchess are keen to emulate former US president Obama and his First Lady who have made substantial amounts since leaving office by setting up a production company, which then made deals with Netflix. The Sussexes are also understood to be looking to found a similar organisation to the Clinton Foundation, according to the Mail. A clip of Prince Harry pitching his weaposs interest in doing voice-over work to Disney chief executive Robert Igor last summer at a premier for The Lion King surfaced earlier this month.He said: You do know she does voiceovers  Iger replied: I did not know that, and the Duke went on to say: You seem surprised.

The Duke of Sussex opened up about his controversial decision saying he had no other option but to leave the UK for North America, admitting his great sadness at quitting The Firm. Speaking at the Ivy Cha Club in London on Sunday at an event for charity Sentebale he pulled no punches as he tackled the move head on. After emphasising the UK is my home and thanking the public for welcoming Meghan with open arms, he added lightheartedly: Finally, the second son of Diana got hitched, hooray! The Sussexes married in May  in St Georgeaposs Chapel at Windsor Castle, seven years after older brother Prince William married Kate Middleton in April  at Westminster Abbey. Harry then made reference again to Princess Diana later in his speech when he thanked the British public for taking him under your wing after her death. He said: When I lost my mum  years ago, you took me under your wing. You looked after me for so long, but the media is a powerful force. And my hope is one day our collective support for each other can be more powerful, because this is so much bigger than just us. The prince was just  when Diana died following a crash in Paris, with footage of him walking behind her coffin breaking the nationaposs hearts. The speech marked the first time he spoke publicly about the reasons why he and Meghan decided to move to Canada since they announced their plans to split from the royal family almost two weeks ago. The prince said the decision was not one taken lightly and that it was the result of many months of talks after so many years of challenges.  I know I haven’t always gotten it right, but as far as this goes, there really was no other option, he continued. What I want to make clear is we’re not walking away, and we certainly aren’t walking away from you. Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the commonwealth, and my military associations, but without public funding.  Unfortunately, that wasn’t possible. Speaking about what was planned after he married Meghan almost two years ago, he said: We both do everything we can to fly the flag and carry out our roles for this country with pride. Once Meghan and I were married, we were excited, we were hopeful, and we were here to serve. For those reasons, it brings me great sadness that it has come to this.

Buckingham Palace’s unprecedented statements reveal she’s very much still in charge while giving us a hint of her hurt at a grandson and his new we relocating to North America. By agreeing the couple can keep their royal titles, although they must not use them, the monarch has been very skilful. She has left open the door to ashould le not work out quite the way Harry and Meghan hope in Canada and the USA. Isolated from most of his friends, Harry in particular may discover the change isn’t as wonderful as he imagines. Important questions remain unresolved, such as which commercial deals are acceptable and the use of the “Sussex Royal” brand. There is also the potential cost to British taxpayers of security for a couple making a conscious decision to leave our country. But people will still wish them well.

expected that the value of the work to be undertaken will be around £,.The warrant has an expiry date of January   and all work must be completed by then.It is understood that the remaining conference centre will be retained as well as the nearby park-and-ride facility.Talks regarding the future use of the site are still ongoing.Plans were previously submitted to the local authority by developers Henry Boot in May  for the land, which hoped to create a mixed use development including approximately  residential units, properties for commercial and business use, a recycling centre and park-and-ride facility.The application is still pending and there was a number of documents uploaded on to the site in , along with a letter of objection received last year.It stated: “The site would have been better used as a new north-east HQ and training hub for Police Scotland with Queen Street being disposed of.“There would be ample space to create a specialist training facility, which Police Scotland does not have anywhere north of the central belt.”Discussions have also been under way with the King’s Community Church over the site, with the church keen to move from its base on King Street.The church began in  with a small gathering before it moved to the city centre church in  where it has remained.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: “A building warrant to demolish the arena at the old AECC and a covered walkway to the adjacent hotel has been approved by the planning authority.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/5e1ec97f6008a6.31141657-846x564.jpg ","title":"fundraiser","story":"Efforts to raise thousands of pounds for

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

Selkirk.But the Chief Executive told the towns Community Council she thinks Peebles should now be first on the priority list for a new school.Ms Logan explained: ldquoAt the moment my view is, and this is only my view, this has not even endorsed by the Council as yet, is that given the constraints that we have around what will be available financially, the Scottish Government have been really helpful in that they are offering their full support and we will make a bid late spring for funding through the schools programme.ldquoThere will obviously be a financial settlement from the insurance.\"But we need to find the best way forward, so my expectation is that we will retain the Sports Complex because it is undamaged and pretty new, we will also retain the Millennium Wing because again itrsquos not that old and is entirely usable.ldquoI would imagine that we will probably end up taking away everything  and replace it with something new.\"What that will look like, I have no idea. But what it will be is something that is modular that we can add ontowe need to for capacity and we will want to talk to the community about what  we might want to put into that site.A consultation will take place asking for local feedback on community space and the possible provision of health and social care.She added: ldquoSome people have said to me that they want to knock all of the school down including the fairly new bits, realistically that wonrsquot happen and itrsquos not the right thing to do. I think itrsquos important that we make sure people understand the parameters within which we are working so we can have some sensible conversations and that we try and accommodate as much as we can in there.Meanwhile, a major operation is underway to get the students back to their classrooms at the beginning of February.The Chief Executive said: ldquoWe put in arrangements for  plus pupils to be accommodated at locations in Peebles, Galashiels Academy and the Langlee complex.ldquoThat has been generally very successfully and the feedback from that has been positive. I absolutely acknowledge that itrsquos not perfect but it has done the job we needed it do to.Senior students are currently sitting prelim exams in the Sports Complex and this will continue until the end of January.Temporary classroom units are being erected within the school grounds and pupils are to be accommodated in unaffected areas of the building.ldquoThere are still huge amounts of work going on and we will go right up to the wire but Irsquom confident we will achieve it, added Ms Logan.The Council has decided on a phased approach with S to S students starting on Monday, February  and S to S working from home and ing the following day.Ms Logan said that there has been ldquocompromises in the education offer over the last few weeks but is assuring parents that from the beginning of February it will be ldquobusiness as usual.Demolition work on the damaged building has been completed and restricted access has been implemented.The council boss has assured parents that children will only be able to access safe routes throughout the school building.Ms Logan added: ldquoOne of the things we did lose in the fire was the vast majority of pupil toilets so what wersquove now got on site is the long term temporary arrangements supplemented over the course of January.To ensure pupil safety, traffic will enter the site from a new access via Craigerne Road located at the back of the school.Ms Logan is meeting with insurers this week to discuss a settlement figure which will help form the direction of the future of Peebles High School.She added: ldquoAll of what we are doing is going to be sustainable for whatever we do in terms of the proper rebuild.\"What Irsquom trying to reassure you is that wersquore not doing things that are very temporary, whatever we do, we will be looking to the future.Community councillor Graham Mackie commended the local authority on doing a ldquoremarkable job and said any criticism of the Council during this trying time was unnecessary.He said: ldquoIt has been thought for several years that we needed a completely new high school but possibly therersquos a silver lining here in that we can end up with a high school that will meet the needs of the current population.\"But the council chief told members that ldquoessentially this is the replacement.She explained: ldquoWhen it comes to looking at high schools and replacement we would always look to retain what is still workable.\"In the case of the bits we are talking about in terms of Peebles High site they are really not that old. The Millennium Wing meets the standards that would be required in a new building. There would be very little point in wasting money knocking down something that works really well. It will be a modern fit for the future school."},{"url":null,"title":"work-start-three-new-social-housing-developments","story":"BOSSES at Scottish Borders Housing Association have announced that work

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know. Countless numbers of so-called lsquocommon servantsrsquo whose lives and fates are deemed unimportant by history remain unrecorded just as the things they witnessed remain absent from our history books.Irsquove often thought it would be fascinating to meet Edwardrsquos ghost and ask him what really happened on that day.Silly idea, of course, but you never know."},{"url":null,"title":"public-exhibition-held-plans-revive-dunbars-east-beach","story":"Dunbarrsquos East Beach, which hosts the townrsquos annual Loony Dook, was once a magnet for tourists but the disappearance of its golden sands over the years due to coastal erosion has led to fewer visitors.East Lothian Council has already been given permission for the first phase of work on the beach, which it is hoped will help sandwhile also protecting the shore.A public exhibition detailing plans for a second phase of work ndash and the project overall ndash takes place in Dunbarrsquos Bleachingfield Centre on Monday afternoon.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, explained the desire to see the beach restored to how it was previously.She said: ldquoIt has been a long-held ambition.ldquoPeople reminisce about how wonderful the beach was and there has been a lot of disappointment that it has been so rocky for so long.Dave Northcott, East Lothian Council structural engineer and project leader, visited the community council shortly before Christmas to outline the plans.Consent is already in place for the construction of a breakwater at the southern end of East Beach.Refurbishment of the existing groyne at the same end of the beach has also been approved, alongside the placement of rock armour at the toe of the seawall.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now. The overall idea is that the artwork reflects past, present and future heritages of the area.There will also be two St Clements Wells name  per entrance in stone, either hand carved or sandblasted.The idea for a stone village sign for Wallyford is also being explored in a design reflecting the ideas of crossing a river or burn by a ford.A spokesman for East Lothian Developments said: ldquoEast Lothian Developments are delighted to be working with Susheila and James to deliver ious artworks at St Clements Wells.ldquoThey have shown real enthusiasm and creativity with the ideas they have brought forward to capture something of the history of St Clements Wells and design pieces which we hope will do justice to the entrances of the development, and spark interest from all those who will pass them.ldquoWe were very grateful to the community council for their comments and input to the designs.Elaine Di Troia was appointed vice-chairman at the AGM, Sharon Jamieson secretary and Beryl Stevenson treasurer.

Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum.

Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat.

That is why the survival of kelp forests is so crucial ndash to hit our carbon targets we need to both reduce our emissions and draw down those already out there. Itrsquos also why kelp is as the heart of a growing push towards what is being called the blue economy.Erwes is one of many international and local speakers gathering in Oban on February  for a Scottish Seaweed Industry Association conference titled Kickstarting The Seaweed Economy. He and others will create a conversation over seaweed in a seemingly new language, a lexicon of blue that includes terms like blue economy, blue new deal, blue co-ops, blue carbon and blue biotech.It will be about how Scotland can create jobs in rural communities, manufacture revolutionary products and combat climate change at the same time. In Erwesrsquo view, seaweed is ldquoone of the key elements on Earth ndash we are just approaching the potential of this amazing organism.In Scotland, we have a history with kelp. We have long harvested it and other seaweed for many purposes, burning it to create soda ash, extracting iodine from it, and producing alginates. Though the industry has for many years been dormant, the seaweed harvest and processing once helped sustain communities on the west coast and in the Hebrides and Orkney Islands. And now, in this age of climate emergency, some are looking to it once more as a crop.As he puts it: ldquoWe want to expand the forest so we can have more harvesting. In Scotland, policymakers should consider this. Itrsquos not only the question of the amount of kelp we are going to take, but itrsquos also for the next  years the amount wersquore going to plant and replant.Already, globally, seaweed aquaculture is a huge industry, though % of it is farmed in southeast Asia. Other countries in Europe ndash the Faroes, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Ireland ndash have a growing industry. But, says Lawrie Stove, managing director of AquaMoor which creates innovative structures for seaweed farms, ldquoScotland is one of the last ones to get going, though we have a superb latent capacity for seaweed farming.A recent report into the potential of seaweed farming commissioned by Argyll and Bute Council stated that ldquothe development of a seaweed cultivation industry would provide important economic growth to the Highlands and Islands.ldquoUntil now, the focus here has been on academic research and therersquos a lot of money available for research but little available for stimulating commercial activity, Stove says. ldquoThatrsquos why we need to focus on the blue economy and bringing blue investors in. Therersquos a desire and a want to farm seaweed, an understanding it should be part of Scotlandrsquos blue economy, and itrsquos coming together.Stove describes this type of seaweed farming, with kelp growing from ropes in the sea, as ldquorestorative aquaculture. ldquoTherersquos an ecological enhancement from farming seaweed in the sea ndash therersquos no fertilisers, no chemicals, no freshwater, no detrimental ecological effects.Not only can seaweed provide a carbon sink, there are also other benefits, he says. ldquoIt can absorb nitrates and it can help towards deacidication of the oceans, by the nutrient uptake that it involves, Stove points out. ldquoAnd it can attenuate wave energy and help protect coastal communities.ldquoBenefits also include the ecological enhancement to any body of water, creating an area that is really good for fish, like a nursery ground, and the creation of valuable jobs in coastal communities.Though this model is called aquaculture, it is little like Scotlandrsquos major aquaculture industry, salmon farming. Fiona Houston, founder of Mara Seaweed, which sells seasonings and salt replacements, describes it as ldquomore like ranching.ldquoItrsquos putting some ropes in the sea and the seaweed grows, she says.Houston is a key force in driving the idea that Scotland needs to rapidly grow a ldquoblue economy. Since she started Mara Seaweed, a product now stocked in Tesco, she has been driven by the idea that Scotland could develop a signicant industry around seaweed.ldquoI spotted that consumers were more interested in where food was coming from, says Houston. ldquoI was also aware that in Asia seaweed is eaten on a daily basis. I thought this is crazy. Wersquove got ,km of coastline in Scotland. Wersquove got a resource that is vastly undervalued. Andwe used it in the past and itrsquos got a role in the modern diet, why arenrsquot we doing it To begin with, Houston wasnrsquot thinking about seaweed as an element in the fight against climate change. That came later when she learned that seaweed was more efficient at capturing carbon than the rainforest.ldquoSeaweed is not only good for you and tastes good, itrsquos good for the planet, she says. ldquoThis is not now about just the value of seaweed as a product. Itrsquos the value it has for carbon capture.ldquoTherersquos a need for the growth of aquaculture beyond the commercial growth. If we could get a bluegreen deal going that would be great.The model Houston and others are advocating is small-scale farming by local communities. One of the things she hopes to do is make Scotland part of an international blue-cooperative of sustainable seaweed farmers being developed by Erwes. ldquoItrsquos about how you create sustainable employment in geographically remote areas ndash and for public policymakers that is a really key issue, she says.Professor Michele Stanley has been researching seaweed cultivation at the Scottish Association for Marine Science , which runs two test farms off the west coast of Scotland. Stanley is involved in ongoing research into the environmental impact of farming. ldquoItrsquos how you manage it, she points out. ldquoItrsquos choosing the right site and size of farm ndash and making sure therersquos enough nutrients in the water to support the growth, and that yoursquore then not going to impact on other organisms around.One of the things she has been doing is looking at how seaweed farming might benefit seale in the area. SAMS is working with a Chinese partner that has already shown that when shellfish are grown with seaweed there is a positive impact on them. ldquoOne of the problems is that the pH of the ocean has been increasing because of the CO dissolving, and that destroys the shells of the shellfish, says Stanley. ldquoIf yoursquore growing it with seaweed, it is taking CO out and putting oxygen in.According to Stanley, there is a fascinating range of possibilities around products from seaweed. ldquoThere are seaweeds that have the potential for anti-inflammatory compounds, antimicrobial compounds. Scotland has a long seaweed history which waned and now yoursquove got renewed interest in it. Among the old journals we have at SAMS from the s therersquos a copy from a meeting which was looking at using parts of seaweed for textile production.One promising product being developed using brown kelp in Scotland is a biopackaging material that could provide a biodegradable alternative to plastic on food packaging. It is, says Dr Charles Bavington, a biochemist and founder of Oban-based start-up Oceanium, ldquoa completely compostable, ocean-safe packaging material.Bavington began this journey into seaweed packaging after he came in contact with Oceanium co-founder Karen Scofield Seal, a business woman who had studied sustainability and, he says, ldquogot really excited about the potential of seaweed for solving a lot of climate problems.They now use the ldquowhole plant from which they make packaging material, food products, an anti-inflammatory called fucoidan, and beta-glucan, a nutraceutical used for cardiovascular health, and water, which will be reused in processing.Oceanium uses only sustainably farmed seaweed. ldquoWe donrsquot take wild harvest, because it wouldnrsquot be sustainable for the kind of volumes wersquore going to need, says Bavington. ldquoBut having large-scale sustainably farmed seaweed is something that isnrsquot available in the Western world.Like many of those working in the field, he is keen that the growth of seaweed farming is approached with care for environmental impact. ldquoWe need to be careful, because there can be unintended consequences of anything, and for what wersquore proposing to work, it has to be at large scale. We need to be really careful and check before we go for huge scale that wersquove considered all the unintended consequences of very large-scale seaweed farming and processing.But some warn that when it comes to kelp, farming it is not where are priorities should be. David Reay, professor of carbon management at the University of Edinburgh, says: ldquoIrsquod be deeply cautious about seaweed lsquofarmingrsquo to tackle climate change ndash we know we have huge so-called lsquoblue carbonrsquo stocks in the seaweed and sediments around Scotland, but these are also vital ecosystems that provide a habitat for myriad species and help to buffer us from the worst impacts of storm surges and rising sea levels.ldquoYes, we need to improve our understanding of these marine systems and the ways in which they gain and lose carbon, but at this stage it should be more about better protecting these precious ecosystems rather than trying to farm them.There is a balance to be struck. Seaweed is Scotlandrsquos forgotten treasure. What counts most that it remains, or even expands as a ldquoblue carbon sink. Kelp clearly matters."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-msp-backs-supporting-plans-free-period-products","story":"Gillian Martin MSP, who previously supported the plans to provide free period products put forward by Labours Monica Lennon, told the Herald on Sunday the need for legislation ldquomay not be as pressing as we once thought it was.It comes after MSPs quizzed Lennon during the local government committee this week on the proposals which would see Scotland become the first country in the world to provide free tampons and sanitary towels universally to women.Concerns were raised about the cost of the plan, which SNP MSPs suggested were inaccurate in Lennons proposals.:University tackles period poverty by postLennon has estimated it would cost around poundm to implement, and has challenged the Governments suggestion that it would cost more than double this amount.During the committee meeting this week, she said she did not know where the governments cost estimates had come from.When askedshe still supported the provision of free period products, Martin said the government has worked with charities and third sector organisations to give products to those in need, and as such a change in the law may not be needed.In , Martin supported proposals by SNP members to introduce an S-card scheme where by women who were unable to afford sanitary products would have a card allowing them free access in places such as GP surgeries and schools.The MSP put her name to a motion which stated \"every woman should have access to sanitary products as a right\" and called for the consideration of a scheme similar to the C-card scheme used in England to allow people to access free condoms, to be applied to sanitary products.Now, the politician claims that the provision of free products may no longer be needed in legislation, and said: ldquoGetting a Members Bill through parliament isnrsquot easy and having incorrect financial assessments on the cost of delivery can mean that it wonrsquot get government or parliamentary support. I understand that is what has happened in this case.:Hey Girlsrsquo phenomenal success sees it close in on aim of ending period povertyldquoThe fact of the matter is that that since people like myself, Women for Independence and Ms Lennon have been calling for action to address period poverty, the government have made great efforts to work with the third sector to provide period products to anyone who needs them. I see that in action in my constituency.ldquoThis work, coupled with free provision in schools, colleges and universities, as well as many public buildings having free access has largely addressed the issue, so the need for legislation may not be as pressing as we once thought it was.Martins SNP colleague, campaigner Julie Hepburn, said she was still in support of free period product provision, and added: \" It is fundamentally about dignity and human rights.\"We have made some really good progress, but we still have more work to do. We know that the outcome we all want is the same, but we do need to figure out how to get there, and make sure we have a scheme that is going to be the best value for everyone,\"Labour MSP Lennon said it would be disappointing should opposition politicians choose to withdraw support for the bill, which is currently at stage one in the parliamentary process.She added: \"Across the UK and many other corners of the world, governments and citizens are understanding that access to period products should be a right, not a luxury. We are seeing legal and policy initiatives developing that are making period products more accessible and this will help tackle period poverty and allow period dignity for all.\"Pupils at primary and secondary schools in England are the latest beneficiary of this and itrsquos a real step change to hear a Tory Minister talk about period equality.\"Thatrsquos why it would be incredibly disappointingSNP and Tory MSPs in Scotland take the unambiguous and conservative decision to block the Period Products Bill at Stage . If the clear general principles of the Bill are rejected, we will be telling the rest of the world we donrsquot believe that everyone who needs them should have the right to access free period products.\"The widespread support from organisations and iniduals across Scotland and beyond has convinced me this Bill is necessary and is the right thing to do.

Earlier, in , as a -year-old rookie politician he had beaten her in a South Lanarkshire council by-election. The pair, therefore, have electoral history.So Ferrierrsquos gesture was appreciated. ldquoI thought it was a nice thing to do, Killen told The Herald on Sunday as he reflected on his loss. ldquoPeople like to see their politicians being magnanimous, they like to see us trying to show where the common ground is especially these days, when much of politics is so isive.Welcome to the too-often-ignored reality of Scottish politics: that despite a mood music of shrill and partisan rhetoric on social and mainstream media, it is mostly local and it is mostly civil.Ferrier and Killen have been working against each other ndash and yet, also, effectively, alongside each other ndash for seven years.They are both from the place they represent and have no plans to go anywhere . And that, election watchers suggest, sets the tone of their contest: eventhey wanted to, there would be no point in running a nasty or bad-faith campaign it would just come back and bite them.This is the case all across Scotland. A detailed analysis carried out by The Herald of the backgrounds of  MPs elected north of the Border shows the vast majority have a strong personal link to their seat.More than half of them ndash  ndash went to secondary school either in their constituency or in a neighbouring one.Killen went to Trinity High in Rutherglen and has stayed in the area since he was a toddler.Ferrier went to Holyrood secondary just across the border in Glasgow. She has lived in the constituency for more than  years.On top of the  locally schooled MPs, another eight were educated in the general region they represent. Four of those had lived in the constituency for more than a decade before they were elected.Another  MPs who had no schooling in or near their constituencies had clocked up more than  years in their seats before they ran for office.They include three MPs born outside Scotland.

Edinburgh Eastrsquos Tommy Sheppard, also originally from Northern Ireland, and Edinburgh North and Leithrsquos Deirdre Brock, who hails from Australia, had lived in the capital since the mid-s.Being schooled in an area ndash or living there for a decade before election ndash is a pretty arbitrary measure of \"localness\" for a politician.Nine of the  MPs fail this unfair test. That is not to say they can not be local ndash or cannot become local after election.Take Alistair Carmichael, MP for Orkney and Shetland for the best part of two decades. Originally from Islay ndash and therefore aware of island culture ndash he was a prosecutor in the north-east of Scotland went he threw his hat into the ring to be a Liberal Democrat candidate in the constituency in the  general election.:New MPs are twice as likely to have private education than constituentsBut Carmichael was not a complete stranger in a seat where \"ferryloupers\" can be frowned upon. He had worked at both of Kirkwallrsquos big hotels, the Albert and the Ayre, a decade or so earlier.After  years representing the area ndash and being re-elected five times ndash does it really make sense to suggest he is not local In Decemberrsquos election two of the SNPrsquos stars ndash MEP Alyn Smith and former MP and TV presenter John Nicolson ndash won seats with which they did not have strong connections. Smith took Stirling. Nicolson secured Ochil and South Perthshire ndash despite muddling the seat with his old East Dunbartonshire constituency at a hustings. But this is far from typical. Ochil is unusual, recently, for having relative outsiders as MPs.Local Labour incumbent Gordon Banks in  lost to an outsider, London-born, Edinburgh-raised and Glasgow-based Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh. She was in turn defeated in  by an English-born-and-raised Tory called Luke Graham . Mr Graham insists he is staying in his Perthshire home after his unseating.Some Scots can take a pretty liberal attitude to what qualies someone to be regarded as compatriot. Politicians, for example, talk about migrants as \"new Scots\". As a stateless nation, Scotland has no citizenship. That means nationality can be a vague and even disputed concept. Is is determined by place of birth  Parentage  Accent, dialect or language  Schooling  Long-term residence  Cultural or political affinity The same questions apply to what makes a politician ndash or anyone ndash considered as local.Back in Rutherglen, newly elected Ferrier admitted there are those who will never accept her as local, even after decades.Ruglonians, she explained, can be a proud bunch after living in the shadow of Glasgow.She said: ldquoRutherglen is a really interesting constituency because people have really got to live there forever ndash they have got to be born in Cambuslang ndash before you are fully accepted as local. I moved in to the area about  years ago, from the neighbouring ward in Glasgow.ldquoSometimes you do get asked that question: where do you come from ldquoVoters really do believe you are going to care more about the constituency because you live in it yourself and you have some history there.Did it make a dference to her campaign that she was local  Ferrier thinks so. ldquoIt probably did help that Ged was local as well, whereas the other candidates they did not live locally though they were local councillors.Ferrier first took the seat in the great SNP surge of , turning around a , majority for the incumbent Tom Greatrex, then one of New Labourrsquos rising stars. Greatrex, who had replaced a local stalwart Tommy McAvoy in , did live locally ndash but he was originally from Kent and has since left the area.: Gordon Brown: UK will have to changeScotland is to stayFerrer said her local credentials gave her an advantage. After she in turn lost, she stayed put and fought to get her seat back.ldquoWhen I lost the seat in , I was still living in the constituency, she said. ldquoThat actually makes it more dficult for you when you are no longer the MP because people are recognising you and you have to go about constituency in your day-to-day business and there is nowhere to hide, really.ldquoAfter I lost the seat, I had community events to go to in my diary. I made a point of still going to them. That was dficult to do but it was the best thing I could have done. It meant I was facing the public I had supported and represented for the last two years.Margaret Ferrier is not a politician you will often see on your TV or making glib remarks on social media.But there is a very high chance,you live in Rutherglen or Cambuslang or Hamilton, that she has chapped your door, or turned up at a church or community event. SNP activists, moreover, describe her as a leafleting champion.Whenever there is an by-election or a campaign, she is the kind of stalwart who runs a street stand. ldquoI am a hard worker, she said. ldquoI like to talk to as many constituents as I can. And try to convince them to vote for me. That is my politics: putting in the graft.Ferrier admits she is not a big fighter in the national political air war ndash she sees that as less of a priority.ldquoIt is the people in your constituency who vote for you and they want to see you,\" she said. \"They want to see you are investing yourself, to make sure you do your case work diligently. For me, the bit at the end is the publicity. Someone  may say the publicity side is more important.Political insiders believe this kind of electioneering, especially against a local opponent, takes some of the nastiness out of politics.Ferrier agreed. She said debate with Killen was ldquocivil. But she stressed activists still faced abuse. ldquoWe had to report incidents to the local police. It is about how you handle that. I have been on so many doors now I reckon I can handle most situations. However, you have got to consider your activists as well. It is really important to train them properly. It is all about safety.As a Labour councillor and MP who expressed the working-class backlash against his party after the independence referendum, Killen is no stranger to doorstep anger either. It is, he said, now getting better for his party as memories fade of its  Better Together alliance with the Conservatives.So Killen recognises the abuse Ferrier cites. But he also thinks disagreements on fundamental issues ndash such as whether Scotland should remain in the UK ndash can be better curated by local politicians arguing in good faith.ldquoPolitics is becoming more heated, he said. ldquoAll of us, I think need to tackle that and keep things respectful and cordial.However, he believes it is just that bit harder to go negative on somebody you could end up running into again and again.He said: ldquoI donrsquot go in that style of campaigning but I think it would be far easier to attack somebody who was being parachuted in from where.ldquoI just bumped into Clare Haughey, who is a local SNP MSP ndash these are people you do see out and about on the streets.ldquoIt doesnrsquot mean you donrsquot criticise, of course, you do, but we all understand it is not personal. You criticise the policies.ldquoI would not pass Margaret without saying hello to her and she would be the same. We would see each other at dferent community events. When I was the MP, she was at a lot of things.ldquoNo-one likes anyone to be bitter or partisan when it is a community-minded issue. If you are both local, that certainly has an impact.The SNP now occupies space ndash both actual communities and centre-left policies ndash once firmly held by Labour. Nationally, this can look like a brutal conflict over small dferences, and the constitution. Locally, it can mean working together.In two-way Labour-SNP marginals such as Rutherglen, it is hard to compete with somebody with whom you basically agree on many things.ldquoIn a seat like mine the competition was between Labour and the SNP, Killen said. ldquoYou do try and find your voice in there.ldquoI am not one for negative campaigning and I never have been. I just go for what message Irsquom trying to put across rather pick out any flaws in the SNP.ldquoApart from the big constitutional issue ndash which is important and obviously does ide people ndash I donrsquot have any worries about how the SNP would go on most other issues.ldquoBecause policy-wise, Labour and the SNP are very aligned on most things.Killen contrasted this with neighbouring Lanark and Hamilton-East, a three-way marginal where Tories were seen as viable contenders.ldquoThere, he said, ldquo it wasnrsquot going to be Labour I would prefer it to be SNP so it wasnrsquot a Tory and I think a lot of people would feel the same.There is something odd about voter attitudes to politicians, Killen reckoned. The public tend to despise MPs in general but to respect their own local ones. Yet most MPs are local to somewhere.Killed explained. ldquoThere is a disconnect between what the overall view of politicians is ndash that they are in it for themselves ndash and the view of local ones. People will often say the person who represents our area is OK but the rest of them are not.ldquoNine times out of  people stand because they live in the area, they care about it and they want to represent it. One of the other reasons that such a high proportion of MPs are local is because of the way that parties run their selections.ldquoParty members much prefer to select candidates who live in the area. Because they believe that person has a better understanding of what the issues re and would do a better job of representing the area.But does this work  Do local parties get better results because they select local candidates  Killen is not so sure.ldquoI do think although the local thing is important, he said. ldquoI would only want to stand somewhere with which Irsquom familiar, somewhere I live.ldquoBut I do think more and more politics, or at least electoral results, are becoming about the air war. You only have to look at how unorm the swings are.ldquoBeing a good local candidate does have an impact. However, unless you are very, very well know it is not going to decide the result.ldquoI have heard people put the local personal factor at about five percent, which seems to me probably about right.ldquoAs long as I have been in politics it has steadily got more presidential, more about the air war. Yet people still like their MP to be local and to live in the area."},{"url":null,"title":"indyref2-mandate-claims-dubious-says-sir-john-curtis","story":"Curtice, who teaches at the University of Strathclyde, said the election result was an inadequate way of judging support for a second poll.Instead, the professor said, two polls carried out during the election campaign were a better way of quantying public feeling towards the policy.In a blog on his website What Scotland Thinks, Curtice said using the number of seats to claim a mandate does not take into account the effect of the first-past-the-post system, and how it calculates seats from votes.:SNPs Ian Blackford calls Boris Johnson a democracy denier for rejecting independence voteNeither should the SNP claim a mandate based on share of the vote at the December election because voters may not have agreed with the SNP stance on the referendum, but still voted for them regardless, he said.The SNP won  seats in the December vote, an increase of  from their previous tally, leading to senior figures in the party claiming it is time for a second independence referendum.A week later, the First Minister formally asked for the powers to hold a referendum from the Prime Minister, something he rejected this week.However, Curtice claims that two polls conducted during the election campaign present a better picture of attitudes towards another referendum than the General Election.He said: ldquoOne of these polls came from Ipsos Mori, the other from Panelbase.

First, they took on  more journalists to boost content. ldquoIf you can be dferent, and this in a way is the Netflix tactic, pour money into content, make great content, then yoursquoll get customers.

Advocates of ldquonew Scottish politics often promised that a new Scottish Parliament would broaden recruitment, notably to increase the proportion of women, but also to become more representative in relation to class, ethnicity, education, and former careers.Such reforms are left to inidual political parties, such as when Labour traditionally led the way in the recruitment of women. There is no institutional provision for ersity. As a result, following a brief honeymoon period after devolution, we have not really seen a major ergence in social backgrounds between MSPs and MPs.Rather, there has been a tendency towards convergence, in which roughly one-third of elected representatives are women and the vast majority have attended university.In some respects, Scotland has lagged behind Westminster, since almost all parliamentary representatives in Scotland are white. The main dferences have to do with the dferent party balance between Westminster and Holyrood.here are fewer privately educated politicians in Scotland, and few are graduates of Oxford and Cambridge, with Glasgow University being the largest source of recruitment. That, however, was true of Scottish MPs before devolution.As to occupation, MPs in Scotland are not remarkably dferent from their counterparts across the rest of the UK. In the post-war decades, Scottish Labour recruited more MPs from the old blue-collar working class occupations and the Conservatives more from aristocrats and landowners than their counterparts in England.Amongst MSPs, this has been reversed, with a common middle class background predominating. Many such occupations ndash such as in law or education ndash were once described as ldquopolitics facilitating because they offered the skills or connections conducive to seeking election.Now, the main focus is on the occupations that may be used as a stepping stone towards elected office, such as MP and party assistants, members of think tanks or interest groups sympathetic to particular parties, and work in public relations or the media, close the political centre. These jobs support potential candidates until they are elected, since candidacy is an increasingly time-consuming task. In many cases, the jobs also help them become elected because they give them essential links to party recruitment. An even smaller pool, from jobs related directly to Westminster or government, may help newly elected MPs achieve rapid promotion within their parties. The proportion of candidates in these jobs, ldquoinstrumental to elected office, are dficult to identy precisely, but we tend to find that somewhere between one-third and one-half of MPs and MSPs have held a job that acts as a source of income and stepping stone to candidacy. Overall, there is a ldquopolitical class in Scotland just as there is a ldquopolitical class in London.It is dficult to come to too many conclusions about how worrying these trends should be, for three main reasons.First, in their book The Good Politician, Nick Clarke and colleagues show that most electors are more interested in more general indicators of MP trustworthiness. They seek ldquohonest, ldquosincere, and ldquogenuine politicians with a grasp of ldquoeveryday le and in touch with ldquoordinary people. A tendency to recruit from the same small proportion of the population seems to undermine the chance that Westminster politicians engage in ldquoordinary le, but it does not undermine their honesty and sincerity.Second, there can be unintended consequences to a too-ambitious shopping list of reforms to the political class. For example, in their article The Politics of Local Presence, Sarah Childs and Philip Cowley suggest thatthe insistence on a local candidate can overshadow attempts to secure more women or people of colour in elected positions.Third, electors want politicians who share their beliefs, and are committed to turning those beliefs into policy. During periods of fierce competition on constitutional and other issues, these beliefs seem to trump shared backgrounds.Electors seem to trust their politiciansthey want the same things, and distrust themthey donrsquot.Michael Keating is Professor of Politics, University of Aberdeen, and Director, Centre on Constitutional Change.l Paul Cairney is Professor of Politics and Public Policy, University of Stirling."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10914517.jpg?type=article-full","title":"former-glasgow-rbs-building-set-demolition-pave-way-new-hotel","story":"Plans were approved for a hotel on the Dale House site, West George Street, almost two years ago.

Rationing also generated thousands of enquiries, and bureaux persuaded the government to grant extra clothes coupons to pregnant women. The first CABs in  were in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Stirling and Dundee.Post-war period: Against expectations, the end of the war brought an increased demand. CABs dealt with more enquiries than at the height of the blitz. Housing problems and family breakdowns increased. To meet this demand, the number of CABs began to prolerate.The advent of Legal Aid and the NHS led to a surge in enquiries.s: Housing problems continued to grow as people struggled with the housing shortage, overcrowding, and the end of rent controls.Hire purchase promised le on the ‘never-never.’ For many this led to mounting debts.s: Rents were rocketing, yet many people were still living in slum conditions and homelessness was rising. By  housing problems accounted for a quarter of the . million problems dealt with by CABs across the UK.Divorce reform too led to a surge in enquiries, with family problems representing  per cent of the CAB workload.s: Family, housing and benefit problems remained the top priority, but the consumer boom saw personal debt soar too. Industrial change saw an increase in redundancies and workers’ rights issues.s: Consumerism brought with it two recessions and debt and benefit cases doubled. Employment enquiries rose by  per cent.

If I get to  that will be it. “ButI still have my health, I might just carry on for another few years...”It’s clear that leaving the SSPCA would be a huge wrench for Sharon so I wouldn’t put bets on her leaving in three years!During her time with the society, Sharon and David have had two boys, Ronnieand Greg . They also have a grandson, Ronnie jnr who is now .But Sharon also brought her work home with her and the couple are now also “mum and dad” to three dogs, two of which Sharon hand-reared, and three cats.“There’s always one or two that pull at your heart-strings,” she said, by way of explanation for their very own menagerie!However, there’s one dog which she didn’t adopt which also brings a tear to her eye.“A wee puppy came in with PAVO virus whom we called Paddy,” she recalled.“He was a wee black and white lurcher type who was at death’s door.“I stayed in the kennels with him for three or four nights and, at one point, he did actually die.“We resuscitated him though and after about eight weeks we got him back on his feet and rehomed.“Seven years later, I was doing my shopping in Dundee when I heard this commotion.“This dog squeezed itself out of a passenger window, ran across the road and jumped right into my arms.“It was Paddy the police officer who rehomed him was on the opposite side of the street from me but the dog saw me, remembered me and was determined to come and say hello.“It was amazing that he remembered me after all that time – they don’t forget the kindness you show them.“A lot of the animals we care for are more than happy to come back for visits with us. They realise its a sanctuary for them so they are more than happy to come back and say hello.“I’ll always remember that day with Paddy though in . He’s now long gone but I’ll never forget him.”Sharon has witnessed many changes over the years and longs for the day when people finally stop being cruel to their animals.However, she knows that, until that day, the SSPCA will be there to help them.She added: “Behind every animal, there’s a human story too.“The biggest problem, other than cruelty cases, that we see is people with mental health issues.“They love their animals but maybe start with a pregnant cat, keep all the kittens and then end up with  or  in their home.“They can’t bear to be parted with them and end up in a dficult situation.“It’s heart-breaking to hear some of those human stories but, at the end of the day, we are here to look after the animals.“Over the years, I’ve seen thousands and thousands of animals who have been nursed back to good health and rehomed.“I’m really, really lucky. Not many people can say they’ve worked in their dream job for  years but I still wake up every day and feel blessed.”SSPCA could not operate without generosity of the publicToday, the SSPCA has nine animal rescue and rehoming centres and a world-leading wildle rescue centre at Fishcross in Clackmannanshire.The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work. The public funds the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team at its centres across Scotland and its wildle sanctuary. The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children through its educational programmes.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.To find out more or donate, visit www.scottishspca.org."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish charity worker surpasses his 50 000 running home target","story":"Even Mark Calder wasn#t surehe#d be able to pull off his mammoth  challenge. In January last year, we featured his incredible aim to run  ultramarathons along some of Scotland’s ancient pilgrim routes.The Running Home  challenge combined his two passions – running and his work with charity Embrace the Middle East, for which he is regional manager for Scotland and the north of England.He hoped to raise £, to rebuild war-torn areas of Iraq while covering the  miles, gathering support and funds along the way.While there were times when Mark didn’t think he’d see the finish line, he successfully completed the challenge.He also surpassed his fundraising tally – with £, currently banked.And he’s hopeful that even more funds will be amassed before he travels to Iraq this spring to see it put to good use.Marksaid: “There were occasions when I wanted to go home.“I knew,I was to quit, I was going home to a nice, comfortable house. The people I was running for don’t have that option.“That was a monumental reason to keep going.”Mark had extraordinary support along the way, not least from his crew – Gareth Brocklebank and Andrew Clarke – who followed him in a camper van, which also acted as shelter in areas where overnight BB stays were not an option.Mark’s we Karen and his two daughters also cheered him every step of the way as did many strangers.“People welcomed me into their churches and communities and generously donated large sums of money,” he said.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Zimeng with piano teacher Sister Avril and trustee Maggie Picken.\"  Fe charity marks  years helping blind people viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"“I was invited to speak in venues I would never have been able to reach in my day job, Iona Abbey being one.“It was a fantastic way to spread the word about Embrace the Middle East.“I look back on it not with a sense of pride, but rather relief – and gratitude for the people and places I encountered along the way.”Divine inspiration also came from a meeting with Father Emanuel Youkhana, a Christian minister who works in Dohuk in Iraq to bring Christians, Muslims and Yazidis together.Mark said: “To see his energy and enthusiasm for what we were doing was a massive inspiration.“That was at the end of Run , the St Ninian run, when I was at my most tired.“To have that intervention made a really big dference.”That particular run had loomed large in Mark’s mind it was the equivalent of running three marathons each day for seven days.Remarkably, though, he only lost one day to ill-health throughout the year.“I’ve learned that your body can adapt to whatever is thrown at it,” said Mark.“I wasn’t sureI’d be able to make it to the end of that run but when I hobbled over the finish line, that’s when I knew I could do it.”The darkest day of the challenge was undoubtedly in June during the St Columba run from Inchcolm Abbey to Iona Abbey.“It was one of the most interesting runs in terms of scenery, with just about every landscape Scotland has to offer,” he said.“There was a long, unsupported section just north of Oban. I was feeling great but, within ten minutes, a niggle turned into barely being able to walk.“I had to find a couple of sticks from the woods to use as shin splints.”However, it was an earlier, shorter run – St Cuthbert’s in March – which cost Mark a full day and also taught him a very valuable lesson.“I wanted to run from Melrose to Lindisfarne, where I planned to stay overnight, but I had to be there for a certain time due to the tide restrictions.“I got lost early on and was chasing my tail for the rest of the day. I started pushing really hard and ended up lost in the hills for  minutes, with no water, torchlight or phone charge.“I rushed checkpoints and didn’t take the time to check my kit properly.“I was dehydrated, didn’t stay on Lindisfarne and lost a whole day because of it.“It taught me a very good lesson – that I couldn’t do it alone and that these runs were pilgrimages, not races.“I had my tail between my legs the next couple of days but the reception at Durham Cathedral reminded me of what I was doing and why.”Mark enjoyed a similar reception at the Forth Bridges, where supporters and family joined forces to cheer him on before he reached the finish line in St Andrews on November .The following day, he addressed parishioners in St Leonard’s Church.It was the perfect place to end Running Home as St Andrews was once such a centre of pilgrimage.Mark took a breather to enjoy Christmas and New Year but has a busy  planned.He added: “I’m heading to Iraq in the spring to see how the money is being spent.“I also plan to revisit some of the places and people I met this year, by car though!“I passed through a lot of villages that were torched in the Highland Clearances.“People were forced out of their homes, and in some cases country, so there’s a sense of solidarity there with today’s refugees.“I was conscious of not being able to spend much time in places where I got a great deal of support.“So I’m hoping to revisit some of those communities, combining storytelling and traditional folk music to consolidate the friendships I made this year.”Karen is not keen for Mark to pull his running shoes back on too soon, but he will be taking on the York Marathon in October.

While the Government continues to dither, local people will feel the impact as we move from being rule makers to rule takers.“Last week I spoke in the house about the risks that new tarfs and trade barriers could have for businesses in the Northern Isles. Food and drink production are a staple part of the isles economy. The impact that continued and intensied tarfs could have on rural communities is signicant and organisations such as the SWA are understandably concerned.“This could be just a taste of what is to come as we leave the EU and our economic clout is reduced. If there were any doubt about the limits of our leverage in future trade negotiations with the US, this is a reminder of the precarious position that the Government is putting us in.“I will be writing to the Secretary of State for International Trade to explain what efforts they are making on these tarfs as a matter of urgency. With the UK losing our seat at the table in these trade talks at the end of this month, the next two weeks are crucial.

With this technology being unmanned, the union representing staff, Prospect, has said  jobs could be at risk.HIAL#s plans, which it says will be phased in, would see control centralised to a #Combined Surveillance Centre# at New Century House in InvernessHIAL has said the changes, which come as part of the latest phase of its controversial air traffic management programme, are aimed at ensuring the long-term sustainability of its operations in Scotland. HIAL has also said there are no planned reductions in staff numbers as a result of the project.The union representing staff at the airports, Prospect, says the proposals are #poorly thought-through, have not been consulted on, and will put the long-term future of vital services at risk.The union has said the plans could take £.m of direct employment away from rural and island economies.Further proposals would also see a review of air traffic services at At Benbecula and Wick John O’Groats, with a new system put in place there, which Prospect says would likely result in a further ten redundancies.HIAL managing director Inglis Lyon, said: “The strategic programme decisions made by the Board will move us into the implementation phase of the project and allow detailed operational decisions to be made. “The acquisition of a base for the new Combined Surveillance Centre marks a signicant next step in the project.“It will allow us to move forward with planning and procurement of the relevant systems to safely deliver a state of the art air traffic control management system and give additional clarity to colleagues and stakeholders as we deliver this complex and challenging programme.“Our focus continues to be on aviation service delivery and providing a safe, modern and efficient means of handling aircraft for the regions and the islands in the future.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orkney has the highest incidence of MS anywhere in Scotland and indeed worldwide.Commenting on the announcement, Mr McArthur said: “MS is a devastating condition that can cause serious pain and discomfort to those affected, seriously impacting upon their lives and those around them.“This decision by the Scottish Medicines Consortium to allow Ocrelizumab to be used in the treatment of early primary progressive MS is therefore excellent news. It is something I know that many constituents, as well as the MS Society, have been calling for over many month. Hopefully, it will help improve treatment and provide a signicant step forward in the fight against this debilitating condition.“Scotland is currently home to world class research that is looking into more ways that people can manage the symptoms of MS, with a view to eventually finding a cure. By sanctioning the use of Ocrelizumab, the SMC is helping encourage further breakthroughs in this research.“Meantime, organisations such as MS Society Orkney do extraordinary work to support those with MS and their families. I would encourage anyone affected by MS to contact them and find out how they can benefit from their invaluable services and support.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Nine miles I tell you – that’s a Sunday School trip with juice and crisps in your packed lunch box before you even think about running along the West Sands to the strains of Vangelis.: General election: Why I’m scunnered with politics these days – Kevan Christie: After  years, I can finally say it: I hate golf – Kevan ChristieThis carry-on, which is straying into ‘a piece of nonsense’ territory, came to the picturesque Fe mining village of Crossgates where I live the other day.No sooner had I left the grounds of the estate in the Toyota Auris,  plate, than I ran into three sets of temporary traffic lightsthat had turned Main Street into a scene reminiscent of the final hours of the Battle of Stalingrad.Humbug Park, Divito’s and Crystal CornerPanic-stricken white van drivers had abandoned their vehicles in the middle of the road as they rushed to the takeaway to get their daily fix of Lorne sausage on a roll.Squads of workers in high-vis jackets crowded round a small transistor radio eagerly waiting to hear what song Ken Bruce had chosen to kick-off his .am Radio  show with before gathering again to listen to the PopMaster quiz at half-ten. Doing anything but working as they let their young hearts run free.Motorists had time to run into the chemist and pick up a prescription in the time it took for the TTLs to change colour. Utter carnage.The cause of all this consternation was the arrival of a fleet, well two... OK one, articulated lorry dropping off building materials at a new development called Crossgates, Dunfermline.This got the old tether up as, to my knowledge, Crossgates has never been in Dunfermline – although I’m sure some parish boundary pedant will be digging out the ancient scrolls in an attempt to justy the unjustiable.We’re a self-proclaimed People’s Republic in ‘The Gates’ with our own shop selling crystals – Crystal Corner – and we’re also home to The Crystal Bar, a target shooting shop, a hairdresser called Kutz for U and the best ice-cream shop in the world – Divito’s.Our football team are Crossgates Primrose who play at the beautully named Humbug Park where Scotland legend Jim Baxter first graced the turf.So you can keep Dunfermline with their Pars, fancy Abbey, Robert the Bruce and his Spiders from Mars.I may add that none of the above have paid me in cash for the shameless plugs and the four boxes of Caramel Wafers I received are on the cusp of their sell-by date, give or take a day or two,No plug for property developersBut the property developers – who shall remain nameless – have felt compelled to attach the name of the nearest big toon to the new houses in the hope this attracts the aspirational . children brigade and their funny wee yappy dugs. “Be gone with your toonie ways – there’ll be no avocado on toast in my backyard.”The area around Dunfermline has doubled in the last few years with no end of new builds springing up in the Duloch Park suburb – which is handyyou’re looking for next-day deliveries from the Amazon warehouse just off the M and a manageable commute to Edinburgh. They also have their own giant Tesco for the milk and maltesers. “Come to Duloch, where dreams are made.”It sometimes takes a while for things like medical practices and schools to catch up when developers decide to create a small town in a field in the middle of nowhere but residents will be spoiled for choice when the inevitable fast-food outlets arrive ahead of the game.All of these shenanigans remind me of a friend from the old country over there in Embra, where this kind of stuff really matters, who told everyone he was from posh Ravelston as he shared the same EH postcode as them.The fact that he lived a stone’s throw from his local The Doo’Cot Pub in sunny Drylaw mattered not a jot as he fancied a better class of pigeon that hung around the “bought hooses” up the road.Upper DuddingstonMy friend and I also like to tell people “we’re old Academy boys” and enjoy watching the confused look on their faces as they try to work out how you can talk like that after going to Edinburgh Academy when we really mean the Leith version.Duddingston and Corstorphine are just two of many ‘desirable’ areas of the Capital that are rapidly expanding with estate agents quick to crowbar anywhere within a five-mile radius into their listings.So, the perfectly decent housing estate of Magdalene becomes Upper Duddingston and similarly Clermiston is incorporated into Corstorphine in the minds of the deluded to whom these things matter.I recently heard the Bellevue area described as North New Town which is a bit of a leap in terms of increasing property values.We can all laugh at this status anxiety and I’m sure everyone can name an area from their part of the country where this exists – a network of spam valleys.Conversely, hipster types look to the more edgy parts of town like Leith in the hope of gaining a bit of street cred and I’m starting a campaign to make Piershill trendy.My last bit of advice folks is to keep your eyes peeled for this type of shenanigans andyou see a sign for new builds that’s been vandalised with marker pen changing “near” to “nowhere near”, it wisnae me.

While it is widely accepted that modernisation of air traffic control infrastructure is needed across the region, Ms Wishart says Hial’s own consultants have acknowledged that the ‘remote tower’ model was the most ‘costly’ and ‘risky’ of the options available.The Liberal Democrat MSP has now lodged a motion in parliament that will see a debate on the issue take place later this month.“It now appears clear that Hial’s management is intent on pressing ahead with their plans to centralise air traffic control services.#This is deeply worrying given the serious questions that still hang over these proposals and the level of concern amongst ATC staff.“Hial has been intent on pursuing this option from the outset, despite its own consultants identying the ‘remote tower’ model as the most costly and risky option. Since then, there has been a desperate attempt to get the evidence to fit the desired outcome.“That is simply not acceptable, particularly given the leline nature of these air services. No-one disputes the need to modernise and invest in the current infrastructure. However, this must be balanced with the safety of passengers, reliability of services and the benefits of sustaining high-skilled jobs in our island communities.“To date, the Scottish government has been happy to wave through Hial’s proposals with little evidence of robust scrutiny. I hope this debate will force the Transport Minister to think again and begin asking serious questions about these latest centralisation plans.”Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston has added his voice to calls for a debate in Parliament on HIAL’s plans to centralise air traffic control in the region.Mr Halcro Johnston, an Orkney resident and regular user of Hial services, said: “I share the concern of many people over Hial’s plans to centralise air traffic control services in Inverness.“There is real concern amongst Hial employees that they don’t feel that they have been properly consulted, particularly amongst those living in the islands. Hial should reflect on the feedback they are receiving and review their options before they commit to the approach they are advocating.“I am yet to be convinced that these proposals from Hial aren’t more about saving money than providing a better service. Given how important our vital leline air-links are, that would focusing on the wrong priority from Hial. “I would welcome the opportunity to see the issue debated at Holyrood and, with Hial entirely owned by the Scottish government, to hear the Minister’s justication for Hial’s plans.# It is understood that Hial is planning to update staff and stakeholders on the air traffic controllers issue later this week. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"man handed payback order and told to pay compensation ","story":"A man was ordered to carry out  hours of unpaid work and told to pay £ in compensation after he admitted taking a backpack from a pub which did not belong to him.Richard Oswald Layfield, , of Horseshoe Close, Virkie, was in the Douglas Arms pub in December  when he took the pack, believing it to belong to a friend he was with at the time.But when he got outside he realised the bag, in fact, belonged to somebody .Instead of putting it back, however, he held onto it – and its contents, which included a £ i-phone, £ in cash and a set of car keys.Layfield admitted a charge of reset when he appeared in the dock before Sherf Ian Cruickshank yesterday.Procurator fiscal Duncan MacKenzie said it would have been simple for Layfield to have rectied his mistake.“It was not the case that he was in a drunken state.

This programme is about far more than that as Club Chairman Jim Brady elaborates: “Our annual programme places its emphasis clearly on the achievement of personal goals for all involved. “For some that might be simply getting out of the house for an activity at a time of the year when the long nights and inclement weather may put you off leaving home. “For others it may be an opportunity to meet new people, to try something new or indeed … to lose some weight.“Whatever the goal, the programme seems to have captured the imagination of local people in great numbers since it started four years ago with some  people in total taking part. “As well as providing the participants with a range of activities to undertake we offer mental wellness sessions, a range of social events to attend and many opportunities to step outside of their comfort zone. “All of our fitness tutors are locally based and that means that as well as channelling funding towards them during the programme they also get a chance to show off their product and attract spin-off business as a result throughout the remainder of the year”.In  the programme was recognised at the Irish News Club  Volunteer Awards when it was awarded the prestigious award for best Club Health  Well Being initiative.

I am still weak but you can imagine what it is going to do for me when I fully recover.“I want to thank so many people, including my amazing CF team at Belfast City Hospital who pushed behind the scenes without me knowing, and the amazing staff on Level  South Transplant Ward who have become my second family. I have spent more time with them this year than my own family.“Then there is the team in ICU. What these guys do is amazing.

As British citizens living in the United Kingdom, we have a complex and multi-layered identity which in many areas is wider than simply Ulster-Scots. We remain unconvinced that the cultural traditions and identity of the Orange family will be meaningfully promoted or safeguarded by these proposal.#Earlier Conradh na Gaeilge had branded the proposals an #historic advancement# for the Irish language but ones which fell #far short# of previous government commitments by the Irish and British governments.The deal includes a number of provisions for the language including the appointment of a Irish Language Commissioner.Dr Niall Comer, President of Conradh na Gaeilge, said that deal was #undoubtedly historic#, however, the organisation highlighted the absence of an Irish Language Act as promised in the  St Andrew#s Agreement. #This legislation is undoubtedly an historic advancement for our community, and for those who wish to use the language, by providing historic official status, legal protection and an Irish language Commissioner for the first time in the history of the state,# Dr Comer said.#This has only come about as the result of a tireless, inspirational and bottom up campaign which has transformed how people here now view the language and ultimately how the state will interact with our community and shared language moving forward.#Ciarán Mac Giolla Bhéin of Conradh na Gaeilge added: #This protection comes in the form of an Irish language Bill being pasted into the GFA, independent from the other language legislation, as new, separate parts of that agreement. If passed, we will hold any new power-sharing executive fully to account on the full implementation of these proposals and will tirelessly test and expose the weaknesses and glaring omissions in the coming days, weeks and months. #There are some huge question marks here. These proposals fall far short of the commitments made in the  St Andrew’s Agreement, which promised an Irish language Act based on the Welsh legislation and does not contain provisions that are made for language in Wales or in the south, as was explicitly committed to by both Governments. #The complete omission of visibility and signage is hugely frustrating and will undoubtedly be a source of tension and will expose major fault-lines on contested cases of signage in the coming period. However, the possibility of the delivery of signage through language standards will be rigorously and immediately tested by our community. #The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services. The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming Executive.#We welcome the adoption of recommendations included in our consultation document for the centuries long overdue repeal of the final remaining  Penal Law, that will now facilitate the use of Irish in Courts the new central translations hub the right to use Irish in the Assembly, where it was previously sneered at and belittled, which includes a provision for simultaneous translation. Finally, the commitment to an Irish language Strategy has the potential to transform our community in the coming years. #We will now work diligently towards testing the glaring gaps in the legislation that prevent us from playing a fair and equal role in our society. Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the ‘official status’ provision. The devil is not only in the detail of the legislation, but in the implementation of that legislation.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"o theanga leipreachain go dti acht ghaeilge","story":"I , caitheadh amach as mo chéad chruinniú den Chomhairle i mBéal Feirste mé as Gaeilge a labhairt.Nó “teanga leipreacháin” mar bhaist Sammy Wilson uirthi.Mhuscail mé inniu agus Acht Ghaeilge ar an táirseach againn.Moill ró-fhada ach d’éirigh linn mar phobal Gaeilge ó Thuaidh tabhairt ar na húdaráis an tAcht a bhí geallta ó  a ghéillstin.Tá na heilimintí tábhachtacha atá de dhíth in aon Acht ansin:Stádas oigiúil.Coimisinéir Teanga.Caighdeáin seachas scéimeanna.Agus ar ndóighe tá ríméad ar leith orm go bhfuil aistriúchán comhuaineach le bheith curtha ar fáil sa Tionól féin agus comhaltaí ag caint Gaeilge.

The first same-sex weddings are expected to take place from February , following the minimum period of notice of  days. The changes follow passage of the Northern IrelandAct , which received Royal Assent last July.Patrick Corrigan, Northern Ireland director of Amnesty International, which played a leading role in the campaign, said: \"This is an historic day for equality and human rights in Northern Ireland,\" he said.\"For too long, LGBT+ people here have been treated as second-class citizens. So, today is an incredible moment for same-sex couples who can finally marry and have their relationships recognised as equal.\"Today, and the weddings which will follow next month, mark the culmination of years of campaigning and we thank our colleagues in the Love Equality coalition and every supporter who helped make this a reality. \"That includes a majority of NI Assembly members who supported the campaign, our champions at Westminster such as Conor McGinn MP and Lord Robert Hayward, and the huge majorities in both Houses who voted for the law change.\"Mr Corrigan also thanked ministers in the NIO, \"and their officials, who have worked with us to give effect to the law within a tight timetable\"."},{"url":null,"title":"heroes of the high street meet the man at the helm of a famous co down business now in its","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tell me about Wardens and how and when it began.A. Were a department store selling everything from screws to curtains and china. We sell tableware, we have a cookshop, an electrical department, furniture, interiors and hardware, and we also have a nursery department.Right now were trading in our rd year and we have  staff, most of whom are full-time.Wardens was established in  by James Warden, who came from a local farming family here in Newtownards.It started out selling hardware goods and ironmongery, way back then, on the site were still on currently today.It was a much smaller premises on High Street over the years, then it was extended back to Court Street.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetUnfortunately, four years after setting up the business James died. He was reasonably young, and in those days people sometimes had a tendency to die at any age.Then it was taken over by his brothers Robert and George. They continued it on for a wee while.Q. Is there a Warden family member who dominates the early history of the business A. James, the son of Robert who joined in , had a keen eye and a keen interest and apparently was quite a bright spark when it came to retailing.He was only  years of age when he started. He developed the showroom from being a hardware merchant and ironmongery into introducing china, fireplaces, and carpets.For a long time in Newtownards it was known as the Wee Boys Shop because he was of such a young age.He was very, very good and we furnished lots of hotels and large houses in Co Down and Greater Belfast.James was probably doing then what we now call interior design.Carpets were brought in three-foot widths and they were all bound together. We still have a loft where its nailed out where they used to measure carpets.James died in  but he was working until his later years and would have very much sat around, directing people around in a chair with a walking stick. He was very friendly.The customer always came first and he was a no-nonsense sort of guy and very, very good at his job and kept everyone on their toes.Q. Tell me about the present generation of Wardens who are in the shop, and perhaps the next generation who might take over A. James had a daughter, Helen, who married a farmer called Campbell.Mrs Campbell is the owner today, and shes in her s. Originally she studied chemistry in Queens but she was then persuaded to join the family firm.Thankfully we also have the next generation in, we now have Jane Campbell, Helens daughter.Jane has some nieces and nephews, so hopefully one of them could be the next generation in.She is in four afternoons a week so its lovely to have her here. Helen was very, very much actively running it, though she always has had a manager and even today we have our inidual department managers.Q. And have you many long-serving members of staff A. Lots of our managers are now in their s and have been here  or  years. When I joined the business there were a couple of ladies in their s or early s and had been very loyal staff of Wardens.In carpets, one lady had been here an awfully long time, as had another lady in the office.When I joined people said to me: \"I hope you realise thats you here until you retire.\"Q. Where do your customers come from A. Our customer base would be within a -mile radius. Theyre mostly from Co Down and Greater Belfast.But I wish people from further afield would make the effort to come to Newtownards and Wardens. Its a fantastic town for ladies and gents fashions, as well as having Wardens.We do have coach tours from the likes of the Womens Institute and its great to see them coming from Antrim, Lisburn and Portadown. We have our own delivery team and delivery service and we deliver anywhere in Northern Ireland.Q. How do you guarantee good performance from staff A. We deeply appreciate and value all our staff. Wardens has got to where it is today from good department managers.We dont pay commission so staff are just there to meet customers needs and try to meet requirements. Were all about customer service and customer focus.We still have an active hardware department. I know were competing against the BQs and Homebases, but again that doesnt matter.If you want a certain size of screw customers know they can come and get customer service at our counter rather than work through the aisles of a giant store like BQ.Q. What has changed over the years about the stock you sell A. The only thing we no longer do is fireplaces but we have expanded more into furniture and carpets.We have a good china and gtware department and one thing we are focusing on is our interior design service and thats what we want to grow on.The interior designers are employed by Wardens and have free access to sell everything and anything from all the departments, and perhaps furnish the whole house from it.We make all our curtains on site, making curtains and pelmets, and have a wedding gt department, which is very successful, plus lighting and nursery, wallpaper and paint.Were still that type of place where you can get everything from a mousetrap to a three-piece suite.Q. Do you think the founder of Wardens would be proud of its long survival, outliving the famous Belfast department store Robinson and Cleaver, and value department stores like BHS A. I have no doubt about that. Maybe people did go into the city to places like Robinson and Cleaver and some of those places arent with us anymore.But we have a nice farming community around here and thankfully Wardens has a very loyal customer base, but you can never take that for granted and you have to work daily to keep it.Q. How have you had to change to keep up with the times A. We have our old friend the internet to compete with. But we now have a brilliant full-time person who works on our own website and she is working extremely hard, so we had to get another part-time on the internet side to assist her.We have a successful wedding department and a lot of its business would be on the internet.Were trying to throw the net wide open and trying to get people.Id have no problem employing more people on that side of things. You do have to adapt to peoples buying.There are those who like to sit and feel and look at items and thankfully a greater part of our business is still coming from that base.Q. You now have the fourth generation of the Warden family working in the business. Have you generations of shoppers, too A. Well,I was asking my sales team, theyll always tell me that shoppers say: \"My grandmother or grandfather used to shop here.\"When we do run events we have a terric response and the amount of people coming in and referring to past generations shopping there is amazing.Every year at Christmas we have our Santa Band . Every year people come and ask us is our Santa Band coming out because they remember coming to see it years and years ago. Its wee simple things like that.Every year we wonder should we bring it out as its a bit worn out and were forced to because people want their photo taken with the Santa Band.Its at least  years old. We had a little collection around the Santa Band this year and we raised over £, for charity.Q. How has your stock evolved over the last  years or so A. Trends always do change. Wardens, like most other good furniture shops, bought stock from all your good mahogany manufacturers, which used to ship container-loads into Northern Ireland.But all that business has gone because people are buying less expensive furniture.I remember people would have bought furniture to pass on down to the next generation and that younger generation doesnt want that look any more.Belleek Pottery is another great make. You wouldnt recognise todays Belleek from the china of  or  years ago and theyve had to change with the times.Q. Are wedding lists still an important part of business  What items usually go on a wedding list these days A. It can be anything from everyday dinner sets to essentials like toasters, kettles and ironing boards, right through to bigger items like mirrors, pictures or rugs. Our wedding list business remains good and strong.But lots of other retailers dont do them nowadays because so many people now live together before getting married and now have all those things already. So they might say to their guests: \"Can you just give us money \"So couples tend to have everything they need and its probably dferent from when I was getting married.Q. What is the future for Wardens A. At Wardens, each and every department is important to us. But overall well just have to change to meet customer needs, should that maybe mean a bigger requirement for interior designers, and Id be happy to bring another one or two onthats the way we need to go. Were also trying to bring youth into the business.Q. Why has Wardens survived A. I think its just down to really, really good local support. And Mrs Campbell and her father James werent greedy people and never took a lot of money out.Any money that was made was reinvested or just banked. Im not suggesting other retailers were foolish, but it was just down to a bit of good sound management and spending money wiselyit was needed.Even today Mrs Campbell would be very, very good that way and Jane is the same. And the fact we own the property is a big help, because with business rates and other overheads, rents would be really punishing.Q. Have you invested in the store recently A. Weve done a new side entrance to the shop which was in great need of being done.Once you step into the store it is like you are stepping back in time, and people do love it.Its a big, rambling place with lots of split levels but people love it for its quirkiness.I have made a lot of changes internally but there are restrictions because of the types of walls and so on.But the new side entrance looks so much better, and weve put in a window there as well, and a lovely big car park on South Street.Q. Are you hoping that theof the Executive will mean improvements in the economy A. Yes. We are living in dficult times in retail. Even now Im hoping that with a local government, that will have a great impact on things like car sales and house sales.With no local government sitting things have gotten worse, especially with say the health service.I just think now that some money is getting injected, and with spending it wisely, it might have a knock-on effect.People have been holding back on bigger purchases in the £,-plus bracket. People now, given a bit more time, will have more confidence to go out and spend money again.We have a wonderful offering of furniture and Im just hoping that we will see an increase in sales.Seven quickfire questionsWhat has drawn you to retail I did a business diploma in Enniskillen and from a very early age I knew I wanted to be in retail. I did well on the course and from then until now Ive only had three jobs and theyve all been in family-run showrooms.What is your motto in business We are aware of the competition we have from the high street names and the online market so we have to be at the top of our game.What would you have doneyou had not gone into retail If I was to rewind back the clock and gone to university and not done that business course I may have become a GP. I think Ive got the personality and toneWhat are your hobbies Im a keen gardener and I enjoy racquet sports and cyclingWhat is your favourite sport and team I like to watch football and Ill be giving away my age when I say I am a big Leeds United supporter.What is your favourite book I dont have a lot of time between work and travel, but Im always following the local press and I always read specialist magazines that focus on homes, interior design, anything thats related to the departments in our store.How do you sum up working in independent retailing Its both a joy and a challenge and an industry Im so happy to be part of."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest delays and updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

whether squirrels were left- or right-handed. data-dfpadtargeting\"\" title\"\" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"\" width\"\" \"\"  By Nilima Marshall, PA Science ReporterJanuary   : AM CommentsPaw preference makes squirrels ‘less efficient at learning new tasks’BelfastIt is not just humans who are left- or right-handed.https:www.belfasttelegraph news viral paw-preference-makes-squirrels-less-efficient-at-learning-new-tasks-.htmlhttps:www.belfasttelegraph news viral  .ece AUTOCROP h bpanews_be--ae--ecefe_EmailIt is not just humans who are left- or right-handed..pushTurns out, some squirrels are also strongly lateralised, that is, they actively favour one side of their body over the other.But unlike humans, where handedness is believed to make brains more efficient, scientists have found that squirrels who demonstrated a paw preference were less good at learning new tasks compared to their ambidextrous counterparts.Dr Lisa Leaver, programme director of University of Exeter’s animal behaviour course and study author, said: “It has been suggested that being strongly lateralised makes brains more efficient, with each hemisphere focusing on dferent tasks.“This could help animals survive, which would explain the evolution of laterality across the animal kingdom.“In fish and birds, there is evidence that being strongly lateralised is linked to better cognitive performance .“However, limited data from studies of mammals suggest a weak or even negative relationship.”To find out more, researchers from the University of Exeter observed  wild grey squirrels who were presented with a perspex tube containing peanuts.Of them,  provided enough data to be included in the research paper, published in the journal Learning and Behaviour.In order to access the nuts, the squirrels had to learn to use a paw, rather than their mouth as their faces were too big to fit through the holes of the tube.Dr Leaver said: “We were measuring how long it took them to stop using their faces and to start using their paws to reach into the tube.“And once they started doing that, we measured which paws they were using – left or right.”We found that the squirrels who had stronger tendencies to use either their left or their right paws rather than being ambidextrous were the ones who didnt perform as well on the tasksDr Lisa LeaverWhile some squirrels showed ambidexterity by using both their paws to access the nuts, others strongly favour one side.The team then measured how quickly squirrels learned the task and how strongly they favoured a particular paw, assessing both learning and laterality.Results showed that squirrels which strongly favoured a particular side did less well on a learning task.Dr Leaver said: “We found that the squirrels who had stronger tendencies to use either their left or their right paws rather than being ambidextrous were the ones who didn’t perform as well on the tasks.“So they didn’t learn as quickly, they didn’t earn as thoroughly as the ones who were more ambidextrous.”She said the findings were in line with these previous mammal studies which suggest “strong lateralisation is linked to poor cognitive performance” but added more research is need to “understand the complex relationship” between the two."},{"url":null,"title":"snooker referee feels wrath of

Grade A office space is the pinnacle quality that can be achieved. This type of property is normally brand new or will have undergone a complete redevelopment with a high-specication renovation.

However, the site has suffered setbacks in terms of redevelopment, The Quiet Man distillery project was put on ice with one of the Chief Executives behind the project reportedly saying “it was really more of a tourist attraction than a distillery” and they had to remind themselves what business they are in. Luxco CEO Donn Lux added that he’d “still like to do the projectwe can get the brand to build, it’s just going to take some time.” Work on a museum marking the citys maritime history has also stalled due to the absence of government in Northern Ireland and the Nerve Visual Gallery which hosted the prestigious Turner Prize closed its doors last year.

There will be a lot more activity from the unusually quiet four piece I’m assured. Very little other craic at the minute. .Squakdon’t have anything organised yet man..Rebecca Mulhernhas nothing on except uni stuff. googletag.cmd.push .Paddy Nashis hinting a vinyl compilation of all his material later in the year. He also describes a few releases and some solo tours as nothing much. Luckily for them Paddy doesn’t compare himself to other artists. .Basorkhave an announcement to make soon. .Fast Thursdayare flat out recording an album at the minuteandhave very few gigs planned so far. .Ryan Vailhas new music lined up and loads of live shows. .George Huttontells me “Two next gigs coming up are the Ulster Hall in Belfast, th Feb. I’ll be releasing my new album in Feb also and on the th Feb I’ve a gig in St Columb’s Cathedral with Ruth McGinley and the Priests. I’ve been asked to be a judge on BBC School Choir of the year, and they want me to perform live on the BBC in the Guildhall before the final, but I haven’t been given a green light to put that out there yet! Hopefully will today or tomorrow! Man, the new album is a big step up, it’s very much down that Irish channel but it also really showcases what I do best”. googletag.cmd.push .Nazirtold me “Working on my next release which I’m hoping to have out in the next month or so, I’d love to playCeltronic again but I guess I won’t know about that for a while, some technical things with involve are holding us back but as soon as we get that sorted I’ll let u know!” .Caitlin Nashsaid, “I have no clue at the minute because I’m heading back to uni soon but I’m hoping to get a few projects done over there and here when I’m back in the summer”. . At some point we’ll work out why  People don’t get paid for playing gigs. . In April Reevahwill be releasing “A Dferent Light” and she’ll also be heading out on a UK Irish tour as well as putting the finishing touches on her debut album which will be out either by the end of this year or the start of next year. .Declan McLaughlinis feeling nostalgic and will be celebrating his entire career this year, from The Screaming Bin Lids to The Whole Tribe Sings to Central Drive to The Hi Flats, share the love on his Facebook page. . If you’re not really a fan of music then mrk my words, there’s plenty of bland music going live this year. .Roewill be releasing a couple of singles this year with an e.p. on its way after the summer.  Noella Hutton has a new album coming out soon.  .Noella Huttonhas a new album coming very soon called “Love  Liars” and you can check out the video for her video for “I’m Going Crazy” from that album on her Facebook page. .Bloodhaven’t gone away you know. .

It was tough on a St Louis team who brought so much to the table, notched some fine scores and had a stoppage time goal ruled out before the game went to extra-time. Throw-in was delayed  minutes, such was the attendance. After playing second fiddle to a dominant but wasteful St Louis for much of the first-half, Maghera were still in touch and only trailed - to - at the break. googletag.cmd.push Ballymena had their exceptional goalkeeper Orlagh Convery to thank for some vital first-half interventions including a breath-taking reflex save to deny Aimee Lennon after Clare Gunnings rasper came off the bar. Caitlin Crawford extended the St Louis lead from a free but with Ceaacutet McEldowney and Bronagh McCullagh grabbing the game by the scruff of the neck, Maghera began to dominate. A fine Caoimhe Molloy point on the break looked like it would inspire St Louis but when Maghera substitute Niamh McCullaghs shot went all the way to the net to open a - to - lead, the game changed. Molloy, like her younger sister Katie, excelled for St Louis. Her thundering nd minute shot to the roof of the Maghera net put them ahead. googletag.cmd.push - POLL Who was player of the match  Vote here... It looked to have captured a first title for the Ballymena school in  years but there was still more drama to follow. First, Clare Gunning leveled the game before yet another twist. Caoimhe Molloy raced goalwards before dispatching a shot that dipped into the top corner with virtually the last puck of the game, but it was ruled out by referee ONeill for too many steps. For much of the second-half, players from both teams went down with cramp. However, following an agreement between both schools earlier in the day, extra-time was played. The games hammer blow was delivered by Clare Gunning, who sank St Louis with her goal in the first attack. It was followed by a third Maghera goal from Blathnaid McLaughlin at the start of the second period of extra-time. Magheras defence, in which Aimee Lennon played a pivotal role in extra-time, kept St Louis to a Molloy point and the cup was on its way back to Maghera.

John Dallats introduction to politics came quite by chance.An invitation to join a new branch of the SDLP was sent to his brother, but John went instead and almost got selected to run for council.He declined, pleading that he was living and teaching in Donegal.Four years later, after ing to Kilrea to take up a teaching post at St Paul’s College, he was chosen to run and so began a letime of council work which culminated in John becoming the first ever nationalist mayor in Coleraine.This period also represented his involvement in rejuvenating the local Credit Union which was in danger of closingA new Conference of Saint Vincent de Paulwas also being set up in Kilrea which would do amazing things for people.Around the same time, the man who was about to become one of Ulsters most hated sectarian killers, was placed by the Probation Service in the very town John lived, and worked in.Just before committing the Castlerock and Greysteel atrocities, UFF murdererTorrens Knight was placed on a local community employment scheme in Kilrea.He left without completing the year of work he was ordered to do by the courts.“The rest is, of course history,” said John. “He and his cronies murdered my friend Gerry Dalrymple, who was in my house the night before the Castlerock murder of four workmen.“His last advice to me was to pull my curtains.“The following morning, he was dead and so too were three of his workmates.“These were dark and dangerous times with armed cops sitting outside the council chamber.“In the beginning I thought they were protecting unionists but when I complained that they could be better used other places I was told by the Divisional Commander it was me they were looking after because I had no control over my mouth!“Yes, Ulster Resistance had brought in guns which were ided among the UDA and UVF and in the future innocent people would die at Castlerock, Greysteel and where.“Among those in the security forces to die was Bertie Gilmore who lived in the same lane as me.“We played together, grew up together and Bertie joined the UDR and I the SDLP. googletag.cmd.push  John Dallat ready for the road in his beloved Morris Minor car. Photo: Mary K Burke “He had retired three years and was recovering from a severe heart attack when he and his we were riddled with gunfire beside the retirement site he was going to build.“Today his daughter is among those who have helped me in challenging times.”Johnwas born and bred in Rasharkin, Co Antrim.“On reflectionI was asked to be born into a dferent house in a dferent place I would turn it down.“I was happy growing up by a Tilley Lamp, carrying water from the well and waking up in the morning with ice on the inside of the windows.“Later on I loved the ‘put-put’ of our ‘Start-o-matic’ generator and Peeke my pet pigeon was never from my side.“She had fallen out of the nest and my mother nursed her back to le while she grew the most beautul brown and white feathers.“An amazing creature of God. I knew why we couldn’t get a council house and I know it was more than just because we were Catholics. “Poor Protestants didn’t get council houses either because they might also be unable to pay the council rent.“Anyway, we kept a goat for the milk which was good for my wee brother Gerard who was special needs both physically and mentally.“He died when he was  and part of my mother and father died too.”John said that being the “underdog” was second nature to him growing up.And it was something he carried with him into his politics career.“It just seemed right and at times didn’t go down well, especially when I sided with the travellers when they came to town but the travellers were good people and attitudes changed,” he said.“When a young girl from a dferent part of the world suffered horric le-changing injuries after losing her job and was left homeless, it seemed right to have her for Christmas in our home and it was one of our best and happiest times ever.“Today she and her family are our best friends and we love them to bits.“When an African student was going to be deported because her visa ran out and her sponsor died suddenly it seemed only right to bring her home and set about stopping her going back to a country where she had only a blind grandmother and no one .“Luck had it I met the head of the Border Agency in Stormont on the corridor and he extended her stay for two years.“In the meantime, she met an amazing husband, married and is among our best friends.“Brian Kennedy played at the wedding and we dressed up in African traditional dress!There is one battle, not yet won, which has had the most impact on John in his role as a public representative.He said: “Perhaps the one story which doesn’t have a good ending just yet is the dreadful murder of Inga-Maria Hauser whose mutilated body was found in Ballypatrick Forest  days after her neck was broken in an attempted rape.“Early next year I will meet her only sister Frederika at a special conference in Queen’s University.“That will be an amazing occasion and hopefully the prelude to her murderer being brought before the courts for one of the most brutal killings I have ever read about.”At the heart of it all has been one thing, John’s family.“Politics had its mixed blessings. I got to see places in the world that I could never have been but it also brought its problems – searching under the car for booby traps, bullet-proof windows and doors and a gun that I know I would never have used.“But politics also gave me the most incredible family.“My poor we Anne was parachuted into the north at the height of the Troubles to a small town which was bombed from one end to the other.“Our daughter, Helena, now a councillor, became the youngest detainee when we were arrested by the British army in Derry shortly after crossing the border.“She was ten days old and our mission was simply showing her off to her Donegal grandparents.“Sixteen years later as a member of the Foyle Harp School she played for President Bill Clinton when he first made that history-making appearance in Mackey’s Foundry.“Later, she would entertain other leaders including President Robinson and McAleese as well as John Major and member of the Royal Family.“I felt honoured when she was invited to play in the Russian Embassy in Washington on Saint Patrick’s Day.“Today the same harp is never out of sight but not played in public anymore.”John added: “Our two sons, Ronan and Diarmuid have been amazing and in one dficult and dangerous year we were on the Aran Islands three times for our safety.“For  years Inishmore, the largest of the three Aran Islands has been our refuge, our safety valve and our friend.“Two weeks ago when I was in hospital after breaking my arm while canvassing, Vincent Mc Carron, one of our friends, left the island during a storm, drove to Kilrea to collect Anne, go to Derry to collect me from hospital and bring me home. He stayed for several days helping with my recovery.”In , one week after his mother sadly passed away, John became Deputy Speaker, a post he held for ten years.“I found it a strange place and certainly not reflecting my background where the term ’Mister’ was hardly order of the day.“In time I persuaded the doorkeepers and others to call me by my first name and I felt comfortable about that.“I felt I was dismantling a bit of the old Stormont that was in danger of being rejuvenated!“All these people were my friends by simply showing them a bit of respect, nothing more and I have missed them dearly over the last three years when I see little of them anymore.”Reflecting on challenges and achievements in his political career, Mr Dallat spoke about stopping the closure or the Belfast-Derry railway north of Ballymena.”The twenty-year project nearly went off the rails several times,” he said.“The Civil Service had a plan to save money by closing the railway north of Ballymena and use the savings to make a start on the A roadway though Toome.“Today the Belfast-Derry railway carries many more passengers than the Belfast-Dublin Enterprise service, but still needs connected to the Irish Rail network and that is a priority for me.John added: “Stopping the closure of the Irish Coastguard Radio Station at Malin Head, announced by Leo Varadkar when he was Minister for Transport.“I gave evidence to a Dail committee with two of my councillors and told the TD’s this was one of the best examples of cross-border bodies, seamless, transcending partition and two world wars, costing very little and actually working!

A progressive society must be a society that works for all its citizens.”Ms Mullan said: “It marks a momentous step for LGBTQ+ people across the North, as same-sex couples receive the long-awaited right to register to marry the person they love and finally have their relationships recognised as equal before the law. “This day is one to be celebrated and is a major milestone in the journey to full equality for all citizens on this island, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. “I would like to pay tribute to all those who campaigned for so long to demand equality, inclusion and fair treatment today is theirs.“The fight for marriage equality has been just one element in the struggle of the LGBTQ+ community, and although this is a massive achievement, we still have a way to go.“Sinn Feacutein is determined to see government which works for everyone, that is our pledge for this mandate.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He said: “We are all very proud of Hollie.She has been a member of Mrs Blankings science club for five or six years and she has always been genuinely pleasedfor other pupils when they have done well, so its great to see her get her chance to shine.Hollie is currently studying for her A Levels and is doing well because she is a very hardworking student.Her project was well chosen because it is so topical at the moment.Of the , projects that were entered in the competition,only  were picked to go the RDS, so to go there and present your findings is an achievement in itself. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The group fuse Celtic classics with modern pop and folk with their programmeinspired by traditional Irish music that has been mixed and merged with more modern music from Irish artists such as U, Van Morrison and Snow Patrol.The programme also includes work from other artists including Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran and even songs from “The Greatest Showman,” all given an Irish twist. Musical arrangements are by Toby Nelms, creative staging by Ian Good. Twenty-seven-year-old Conor is a graduate of Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts and has worked extensively as an actor-musician. Coming from a family of seisiuacuten musicians and singers, he is particularly delighted to share the trad-pop fusion that The Four Harps have created. As well as Conor, the group also consists of -year-old Ryan Lynch, from Strabane, -year old Kevin Fagan from Dublin and -year old Fergal O’Hanlon from Galway.Having trained at Northumbria University and Associated Studios London, group creator Ryan has appeared in several productions including new musicals such as The Clockmaker’s Daughter. Most recently he toured the world with a major cruise line playing leading roles in popular musicals including “Tony” in “West Side Story.” Fiercely proud of his roots, he has always loved Irish music and in  developed a solo show singing some of his favourite songs. The response was so positive that he decided the way forward was to further develop the idea and form a four-piece male harmony group. With a busy work schedule it wasn’t until earlier this year that he was able to bring together the right line-up.The boys have already performed at the Kinky Kaberet, The Phoenix Arts Club, Archer Street, Soho, The Concorde Club, Southhampton, The Above the Stag Theatre and Picadilly’s, Crazy Coqs, Live At Zedel.Kevin has worked as a performer since childhood as a cabaret host and singer and actor.

He trained in Ireland and has appeared in ious film and stage productions, including work in the USA.It is now full steam ahead with recording sessions and a potential Britishand Irish tour. Ryan is confident The Four Harps and their programme of music, which includes “The Irish Rover,” “Danny Boy,” “You Raise Me Up” and “With or Without You,” will have a wide appeal. He said it was their aim to introduce the beauty of Celtic music and voices to the world intend to tour their shows internationally.The Playhouse performance will take place on Saturday,  March, starting at :pmgt tickets are priced pound. pound.. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Bangor attacker played in Kurtis Bell, who slotted the ball into the inside side-netting after Saintfield were dispossessed at the edge of their own box.Saintfield raised it a few gears and struck three times in the  minutes before half-time.The first came from Andrew Clarke after James Sofley was played down the line. After beating two defenders, James played in Andrew, who passed the ball into the bottom right-hand corner past the lsquokeeper.It took less than five minutes for left back Oliver Duff to score Saintfieldrsquos third. A long ball found Adam Childs on the left wing.He played it back to the edge of the box for Duff. He took one touch to set himself before striking a powerful left-footed shot into the bottom right corner.The Saints scored one more goal before the break with Andrew Clarke playing the ball across the face of goal for Tony Liken to finish at the back post. Saintfield went into half-time in the driving seat and - up.The second half started much like the first ended with Saintfield scoring an early goal.Ryan Sofley was the supplier of an own goal after bombing into the box and fizzing a cross into the near post which ricocheted off the Bangor defender into the net.At - up, the Saints took their foot off the gas and conceded just over five minutes after scoring.Bangor gained possession from a loose ball in midfield and played it into Matty Hall, who turned well to beat the Saintfield defender before striking the ball low and hard into the bottom corner.The Saints were again quick to respond with Andrew Clarke getting his hat-trick with half an hour still to go.Clarke started the move in midfield and finished it expertly after James Sofleyrsquos effort was parried by the lsquokeeper.Saintfield had a penalty and rebound saved less than two minutes later after James Sofley was brought down in the box.However, the Saints werenrsquot finished yet and Clarke had one more goal left in them with  minutes left to go. Possibly the best goal of the game, as he showed real determination and skill to score his fourth. Another counter-attacking goal from the Saints as they broke fast from a Bangor corner.Clarke received the ball just inside the Bangor half and stood tall after several attempts to bring him down. He beat three defenders before slotting home a cool finish into the bottom corner.This goal also signalled the end of the goalkeeperrsquos game after he strongly disagreed with the refereersquos decision to allow the goal to stand. Bangor had one more chance before the end of the game when they were also awarded a penalty, but David Harper kept the Saintsrsquo five-goal lead intact and made it a penalty saved for both teams.A great performance for Saintfield who progress to the next round of the cup and a fantastic performance from  year-old Andrew Clarke who relished his role as an attacking midfielder.Saintfield United Bangor Young Men CLARENCE CUP ND ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call to begin work on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"THE re-establishment of the Stormont Executive has led to fresh calls for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed multi-million pound bypass.Newly appointed Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon is being urged to signal the start of construction work on the scheme which is estimated to cost in excess of poundm.South Down MP Chris Hazzard mdash a former roads minister in a previous Executive who signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December  mdash has written to Ms Mallon seeking an assurance that the Ballynahinch scheme remains a priority for her department and that construction work will start as soon as possible.In addition, Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is tabling a notice of motion at the February meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council seeking across-the-board political support to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon discuss the next step in the construction of the bypass.He also confirmed that Strangford MP, Jim Shannon, has written to Ms Mallon on the issue and is seeking a meeting with her to discuss the issue.There has been major progress on work on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads, with work already completed on a major archaeological investigation along parts of the route.Work was due to complete on the schemersquos economic appraisal before the end of last year, with roads engineers confirming recently that in order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents was ongoing to ldquominimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.The by-pass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting that it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.They are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the by-pass would provide a good economic .The scheme is designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard said that following his decision to formally sign off the scheme at the end of , the government department had been working through ious legal stages to ensure the scheme could commence as soon as possible.ldquoA programme of geotechnical investigation works on lands along theof the scheme was completed in  with advanced archeological investigation works completed last year, he confirmed.ldquoThis allowed the Department to move ahead with the final stage of preparing contract documentation in readiness of funding becoming available to construct the scheme.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWith an Infrastructure Minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont this week, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.Cllr Walker said it was the view of many, including senior roads engineers, that the multi-million pound scheme was vital to the survival of Ballynahinch town centre and will play a signicant role in helping boost the wider South Down economy.He said given that the project is shovel ready, it is essential that the cash is earmarked to allow construction work to start this year is forthcoming.ldquoMoving forward what is now required is the finance to build this scheme, continued Cllr Walker.ldquoIt is clear to me that when you look at other parts of Northern Ireland that Down District has consistently missed out on major roads funding. That must change and the cash needed to build Ballynahinchrsquos new bypass must be made available.The Rowallane councillor said that the bypass can help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre and act as a catalyst to encourage new investment.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe eagerly-awaited scheme can address town centre gridlock and along the main approach roads.

Lidl, which currently employs  staff, claims its proposal will create  new jobs.In late November, the local council confirmed that outline permission granted in March for the multi-million pound development was to be quashed as a result of a judicial review brought by developer Don Holdings Ltd.However, days later, the agenda for the December meeting of the Planning Committee included a plannersrsquo recommendation to approve the new store proposal. The recommendation was subsequently withdrawn, but features on the agenda for todayrsquos meeting with a recommendation to approve.The Newcastle development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal, with planners receiving  objections. Five five letters in support of the new rescue team base proposal have also been lodged.Lidl has consistently argued that its current base at Railway Street in Newcastle is too small to allow the store to carry the companyrsquos full range of goods, highlighting issues with narrow aisles and inadequate parking provision.It says the Railway Street base was only supposed to be a temporary home until a larger unit could be found.Lidl says it has been looking for an alternative town centre site for over decade without success until the Shanslieve Drive site became available, with the planned mountain rescue team centre providing the volunteers with a permanent base.Objectors to the new store proposal claim that there are ldquoserious errors in the transport assessment submitted in conjunction with the planning application, inaccurate land ownership information, unachievable visibility spays and out-of-season traffic surveys.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that the Lidl planning application was deferred to allow further consideration of a number of submissions received by the local authority.She added: ldquoThe Council is endeavouring to bring this application back to the Planning Committee in Februarypossible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 15%2C 1980  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash Police believe that a professional gang were behind the drugs raid on a Ballynahinch chemist shop at the weekend.The thieves smashed their way into Hannawinrsquos Medical Hall in Main Street through a skylight and forced open a door to get to the shop. They used a crowbar to prise the steel cabinet containing a store of dangerous drugs out of the wall. The cabinet was later found along the side of the Carrickmannon Road, near Ballygowan.The drugs taken included heroin and cocaine, both of which are dangerous even in small doses. They are types of hard drug in big demand on the black market. Additives like glucose are used by drug pushers to multiply the volume and increase profits. Other drugs, including morphine and strychnine, were also taken.The raid was the latest in a spate across the province and police fear that the addiction problem could be more serious than previously realised.Police chiefs have backed chemists pressing for an urgent review of the Home Office regulations about the keeping of prescribed drugs in steel cabinets.The present procedure is making things too easy for the thieves. It has meant that the hard drugs are all kept in the same place and the professional thief knows that.Before  regulations, chemists had better safeguards, evenit meant hiding the hard drugs on the general drugs shelves. It meant that thieves could not go straight to the security cabinet and other break it open or take it with them.The head of the RUCrsquos drugs squad, Chief Inspective George McBride, said he agreed that there was an urgent need to re-examine safety procedures for storage of dangerous drugs.DOWNPATRICK mdash Compensation for the destruction of St Patrickrsquos Hall in Downpatrick has been agreed mdash almost six years after it was destroyed by fire.The trustees of St Patrickrsquos Parish were awarded pound, at Downpatrick Crown Court last Friday after a two-hour hearing.The award was made in four parts, the bulkbeing attributable to physical damage and the remainder split between loss of profits , contentsand site value pound,.The claim had been before the court for over a year and was held up after the Northern Ireland Office disputed the amount of the parishrsquos claim for loss of profits.On Friday counsel for the Northern Ireland Office argued that the hall trustees had not made a big enough effort to reduce lost profits. But this was strongly refuted by counsel for the hall trustees.In a -minute summing up, the judge looked at the ious points of the case. He said he felt the church had not acted unreasonably and that the trustees had done everything required of them under law.STRANGFORD mdash A Strangford schoolboy will pack his bags later this year to take up a scholarship at a new college at Cambridge mdash with the long term prospects of becoming a Cambridge don.He is  year-old Andrew McDowell, who is an A Level student at Down High School, and he learned this week that he was won an open exhibition to the famed university.In academic terms he has won the equivalent of a junior scholarship and he will be among the first major intake at the new Robinson College.Andrew already has nine O Levels and he sat the examination in November along with several thousand others.In October he will pack his bags to concentrate on Mathematics at the college, with the scholarship being renewable after two years. His success is all the more remarkable because he is a year younger than most other candidates.Andrew is studying A Level Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry at Down High.

The Ballynahinch venture was unique in having a large amount of surviving documentation.Mr Reid says it is clear from these papers that the scheme organised by the First Presbyterian Church was sophisticated, comprehensive, self-funded, and cradle-to-grave in scope. It included widowsrsquo and old age pensions, end of le and burial grants, and support for orphans.Finance allocated to the project was known as lsquoThe Poorrsquos Moneyrsquo. The scheme operated late in the reign of William III and was continued into the time of Queen Anne, George I and George II.Nowadays benefit claimants unable to work through illness or injury, are paid Employment Support Allowance, .In  a similar scheme was obviously operating in Ballynahinch. The church carpenter at that time was John Gough, and that year he suffered a signicant injury, perhaps a broken arm or leg. He was unable to work or to earn a living for over a year.John had been married six years earlier in , in his home congregation by Rev James McAlpine. His we was Elizabeth, neacutee Ferguson. Their children soon followed mdash Christine, who was five in  Rebecca, who was four, and their twin boys, George and James, who were just one year and one month.With four young children and no income, John and Elizabeth were soon struggling financially. But in April the church stepped in immediately, with payments for an initial three-month period, at six shillings per instalment. In August John tried to resume work, but couldnrsquot. The church continued payments, but now at a reduced rate of d. Another attempt at work in October  failed again, and again payments resumed.John eventually recovered and ed to work permanently in August , having received a total of  support payments from First Presbyterian. He resumed his valuable role in maintenance of the fabric, receiving church contracts in ,  and .The problem of unwed mothers and absent fathers is one that troubles every age and every generation. Back in the early s, the Ballynahinch Session took a stern approach to fire-and-forget fatherhood.Their starting point was an interview with the expectant mother to ascertain the identity of her co-responsible male partner. If she proved uncompliant, exclusion from church attendance was then threatened. Faced with resultant near-total social ostracism, the mother-to-be soon cooperated.The next stage involved the errant couple appearing some Sunday morning before the entire congregation, kneeling on the Stool of Repentance and confessing their extramarital transgression. After that they were received back into the congregation. Their child was baptised and recognised as a church member.In a -year period the Ballynahinch Session dealt with  such cases. In six, they identied both parents. In six other cases only the mother was identied in seven, only the father. In one case the origins and surname of a lsquofoundlingrsquo child were known, but neither parent actually came forward.By st century standards, these church procedures sound draconian. But they had the purpose of protecting the rights of the child and of offering an opportunity to the parents for their reputations to be salvaged,possible.The alternatives were a lot worse. It was common in the s for the sexton at Magheradroll Parish Church to discover live newborns abandoned overnight on his church doorstep, ordead through neglect or infanticide, to find their bodies surreptitiously concealed in adjacent graves.In Ireland such surviving infants were sent in large numbers to the Foundling Hospital in Dublin, which who received between ,-, orphans annually. The hospitalrsquos mortality rate was some %.In Ballynahinch, under Presbyterian auspices, some such infants were spared this grisly fate. The lives of a number of potential orphans were actively protected by the church in their home town.Under the Welfare Reform Act of , Disabled Living Allowance was controversially replaced with Personal Independence Payment. DLA payments were made to claimants who often had long term medical conditions. The amount of the award ied according to the degree of disability.Interestingly, in Ballynahinch in the early s, First Presbyterian made a number of long-term DLA-type awards to some lsquosupplicantsrsquo.Ms Grissel Foreman was on such a benefit from -. Some financial records of the Poorrsquos Money still exist. But all its other documentation is lost, so we donrsquot know what Grisselrsquos ailment actually was. It was obviously slow and progressive, perhaps something like tuberculosis, or multiple sclerosis, or Parkinsonrsquos.As her condition deteriorated, the church increased its amount of financial support. In  she received seven payments totalling s d. By  this had escalated to  payments totalling pound s d.She died in  and was buried at church expense. Over  years, amounts paid to her totalled pound s d. This was an enormous sum, considering the church ministerrsquos annual stipend at the time was pound.These and many other such stories will be outlined on Monday night at Down Museum.

We must go out there and grab them by selling what the district has to offer.Cllr Curran said given that the Newry, Mourne and Down area is the third largest of the provincersquos  district councils, it should be an ldquoattractive proposition for potential investors.ldquoThe focus moving forward must be on new job creation in both the public and private sector. It is important that we sell what the area has to offer.In relation to public sector job opportunities, Cllr Curran said available space at the Downshire Civic Centre could be utilised by a number of government departments keen to decentralise their operations from the greater Belfast area.He continued: ldquoNew investment will not happen out of the blue. We all have a duty to work together to secure it. I believe we need new hotels and there is a need for such a facility in the Downpatrick area and hope see progress on this issue in the near future.Cllr Curran is particularly keen to see the proposed commercial development at the site of the former Irish Street police station in Downpatrick and a number of adjacent derelict buildings progressed this year.ldquoThis exciting proposal has the potential to restore Downpatrickrsquos economic heart, create jobs and, most importantly, provide a boost for existing businesses via increased footfall, he said.Cllr Curran also warned that while attracting new investment is crucial, cracking Downpatrickrsquos traffic congestion problem is also essential.ldquoGridlock continues to stle town centre investment and we need to act quickly. While expensive schemes have been proposed in the past, nothing has happened. We must see progress in  and ensure roads officials deliver.ldquoWork was completed recently on a major upgrade of the Collinsrsquo Corner junction and while welcome, I and others remain to be convinced that it will address congestion problems in the heart of the town.Cllr Curran said roads officials also deserve praise for the improvement scheme in Fountain Street and hopes that in  efforts will be made by the Department for Infrastructure to improve Edward Street.He added: ldquoThis is a real problem area which has not been addressed. The presence of a busy primary school should ensure that roads officials redouble their efforts to improve driver and pedestrian safety.

Rail chiefs, who had been hoping for investment after the railways had proved so crucial to the war effort a few years earlier and that the buses would be barred from competing with the trains and instead provide a feeder service to stations, were devastated at the outcome.ldquoThe recommendation, accepted by Stormont, was that the entire Belfast and County Down Railway main line from Belfast to Newcastle, including the branches to Donaghadee, Ballynahinch and Ardglass, should be closed.The only route to be saved was the Belfast to Bangor connection, which continues operating successfully to this day.Mr Gardiner continued: ldquoThe attitude of Stormont was that it would be cheaper to move everything to the roads than to invest in railways that had been run down during the Second World War. People would use the buses instead. They developed huge road building schemes mdash most were never completed mdash but closed the railways first before these were even started. It seems incredible today.ldquoThe most puzzling element of the decision was the axing of the Belfast to Newtownards line, which served the east of the city mdash Dundonald, Knock and Comber areas in which the suburbs were developing and likely to provide increased commuter traffic had they been spared.ldquoIndeed, there were more than enough new diesel trains ordered to operate both the Bangor and Newtownards lines mdash and evidence suggests that the Transport Tribunal expected Stormont to spare the Comber line as a compromise option and as late as , before the tracks were lted, they were calling on the minister responsible to reverse the decision and trial these new diesel trains on this section of track mdash a call that fell on deaf ears.The  closures were the first steps in a plan which was to see the reduction of the Northern Irelandrsquos railway network from  miles to  miles mdash a decrease of  per cent.A decade later, the Great Northern Railway was ided between the UTA and its counterpart in the Republic, CIE, and further closures to lines to Armagh, Dungannon, Omagh and Strabane occurred.Willie Watterson and James Magill, who were porters and ticket clerks at Newcastle and Tullymurry stations, recalled their memories of the last train in an interview recorded for the BBC documentary lsquoRaising Steamrsquo in ldquoThe last train was a Sunday night. It was a cold winter night, January , , said Willie. There was twelve coaches, and two engines and two guards. She was packed. Packed to the doors. So I lit all the lamps, and put detonators on the line to give her a send-off.James added: ldquoI think every station did the same thing, so when the train came in there was a salute of bangs. I felt terrible about it, terribly terribly sad. I still felt it couldnrsquot happen. Still felt theyrsquoll come back, theyrsquoll run again. I couldnrsquot believe therersquod be no more railways, after working on them so hard.Adam Hamilton, who was a fireman mdash the person who stoked the fire on the steam locomotives mdash said: ldquoIt broke my heart, because the railways were in my blood. I still hear the sound of the steam still running on a clear night puffing away.Today, the Downpatrick and County Down Railway keeps the memory alive through its reconstruction of two miles of the former main line, as well as restored carriages rescued from their fate as hen houses.As part of its commemorations of the BCDRrsquos demise, it is keen to make contact with anyone who had any connection with the network, including former employees or their families, or people in possession of railway memorabilia such as photographs, tickets, timetables or even carriages.Mr Gardiner added: ldquoOne thing we would love for the museum is a BCDR unorm or tunic. So far we have been unable to track one down. Perhaps you have something in your loft And what of the future of the line  In November  the section of the BCDRrsquos former main line from Holywood Arches to Comber was opened as the Comber Greenway, whilst other sections have been used for roads as well as the section around Downpatrick being used by the DCDR.In the early s Northern Ireland Railways prepared a feasibility study into reopening the line to Newtownards, but this was not taken further by the Direct Rule administration.In May , the Department for Regional Development published its Railway Investment Prioritisation Strategy, which promised feasibility studies into the reopening of closed railway routes to Armagh, Dungannon and Castledawson by , but not including the Comber Newtownards route.However, maybe  years after the first railway closure in Northern Ireland, the new Minister for Infrastructure in the restored Stormont Government might see the first of those historic mistakes rectied.The Downpatrick Railway Museum can be contacted via email at info@downrail or message at www.facebook downrail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Mickey.jpg","title":"Mickey ‘magic’ to help Magpies lift cup  ","story":"KILCOOrsquoS tearaways may hold the key to success in Sundayrsquos All-Ireland Club SFC final at Croke Park.The ability of their six forwards to win dirty ball and turnovers could dismantle the perceived invincibility of Corofinrsquos much-vaunted defensive system.Corofin, described in many quarters as the best club team ever, have an enviable set of defenders who squeeze the le out of the opposition.However, they have never encountered a team like Kilcoo before that has  attackers and  defenders.Conor Laverty, the three Johnston brothers mdash Ryan, Jerome and Shealan mdash Paul Devlin and Ryan McEvoy fight tooth and nail for every ball.They are the clubrsquos first line of defence and are not afraid to go where angels fear to tread, but can then turn into a snatch squad with the blink of an eye.Kilcoo will have to be at their bestthey are to cause an upset as the Galway and Connacht champions are sizzling hot favourites at   to win the Andy Merrigan Cup for an unprecedented third year in a row and the fourth time in six years.Certainly, Kilcoo have it all to do, but they fear no side.Manager Mickey Moran has twice taken Slaughtneil to All-Ireland finals day and few would begrudge the Derry man a first title with Kilcoo.He has transformed the Magpies into a ruthless, disciplined machine in a quiet, unobtrusive way and has won many admirers for his style of play.He started out in management in  when he took over the reins at Derry, the first of three separate spells in charge of the county team.

While pay parity and safe services are key issues for us, the key thing is that there are enough recurrent resources in place to deliver this now and in the future.Irene said the RCN is about putting patients first, describing the scale of the hospital waiting list issue as ldquounacceptable.She added: ldquoEmploying more nurses can help bring waiting lists down. This is not a new phenomena. It is tough to work as a nurse and it is not an easy job. But we currently have a situation where some nurses are taking on extra shts to earn more money, but that is just an unacceptable way to live.Alison Megarry said patients are nursesrsquo primary concern and at the heart of what they do, highlighting the need to keep staff working in Northern Ireland to ensure they donrsquot go across the water and donrsquot come back.She revealed that she was talking to a nursing sister last week who was working on international recruitment for nurses in Mumbai to work in Northern Ireland.ldquoThe nurses in India said why would they come here when the pay is less than it is in England, Scotland and Wales. I believe thatwe can keep our nurses here, it will help to tackle the waiting list issue, she said. ldquoThe big issue we have is that the population is ageing and people are living longer which therefore impacts on waiting lists.Nurse Sonia McCoubrey said that while pay parity is one issue, additional nurses are also required. She said many newly qualied nurses are choosing to go to England, Scotland or Wales because the money is better.She also said she worries about the safety of newly qualied nurses managing dficult situations and the patients they are caring for.ldquoYou have trolley waits and people lying in corridors. There is no privacy, no dignity and the situation is appalling. You go home at night after a sht burnt out and worried about what you have seen, the nurse added.Nurse Donna Boyd also expressed concern about waiting lists and said she fears that the situation is going to get worse, forcing many people to go private.ldquoIf more money is put into the system nurses are quite happy to do even more to help reduce waiting lists. All nurses go and above what is required of them when they are working, often staying after their scheduled quitting time which is unpaid work, she said.ldquoWith more people going private because of y waiting lists, a lot of the doctors and consultants are taking on private lists which then impacts on the NHS list. I have friends who were nurses who have left the profession to work in supermarkets because they have burnt themselves out.

Across the resort,  street lights are not working.The figures are available on the NI Direct website under the reporting fault problems menu with other districthot-spots including Ballynahinch where  street lights are currently out of order.Elsewhere,  faults have been reported in Killyleagh, with  brought to the government departmentrsquos attention in Castlewellan and Crossgar. In Saintfield,  faults have been reported.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Sixteen street lights are out of order in Dundrum with  faults reported in Drumaness. The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Last month, the Department for Infrastructure confirmed that its current budget for street lighting repairs was approximately poundm, explaining that the figure was much lower than the pound.m needed to provide a full street lighting repair service.It also revealed that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran described the number of reported street light faults across large parts of East Down as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.He said broken street lights in many areas represent a health and safety issue, explaining that an examination of every town and village across the district will reveal a signicant number of faults.Cllr Curran described faulty street lights as a ldquohot topic with politicians being contacted about the issue on all almost daily basis. He said the legacy of underfunding the roads department has experienced is now clear for all to see.The politician said many will be concerned that the Department for Infrastructure does not have the money it requires to carry out much-needed repairs.ldquoWhile I understand the decision to prioritise emergency repairs, there is no doubt that the alarming figure of almost  faulty street lights across East Down is simply going to increase. Clearly the issue is going to get a lot worse before it gets better, he said.ldquoStreet lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem. A fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.Cllr Curran said that while the new Stormont Executive will inevitably face calls for investment in many key areas including health and education, the Department of Infrastructure also required an injection of funding.He added: ldquoWhile the focus for some will be on major new roads schemes which is understandable, it is clear that the creaking infrastructure the government department is responsible for, including street lighting, requires major cash injection.ldquoThe street lighting issues requires immediate attention. We are still in the grip of winter and several months away from the clearer evenings. Now that we have a local minister in place, I hope to meet her on this issue and other matters of local importance.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continued to face budget challenges and resources were currently not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service.She added: ldquoDue to this restricted service, outages are taking longer than usual to be repaired. However, priority will be given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Tributes.jpg","title":"Tributes to lawyer who was ‘a real gentleman’  ","story":"TRIBUTES have been paid to a lawyer who died last week.Mr Paul McAlinden, who was a barrister, died peacefully in Belfast City Hospital last Wednesday.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves. The vast majority just wonrsquot be able to do this.ldquoIntroducing policy which isnrsquot fit for purpose could have severe consequences.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The event was well attended, and we estimate over two hundred turned up.ldquoAt present we have organised an exhibition in Chepstow Museum celebrating the tradition, with over  artists displaying work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I started the week as usual by walking Isaac to school, enjoying a father-son chat about the day ahead. has seen a rocky start with wildfires ravaging through Australia and tensions rising in the Middle East but this cannot set the tone for what is to come.As someone who has family in Australia, I am truly appalled to see the spread and devastation of the fires, but also the initial response from senior Australian politicians.Their denial of the link between the climate emergency which we face globally and the disaster which has swept across their nation is completely incomprehensible.Moving forward we must accept that we are in a state of emergency and must take drastic action to limit as much of the impact as practicably possible.We certainly have an interesting year,not decade ahead. The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They each received weekly book vouchers, provided by Egmont, to spend at Grfin Books, and coffee shop vouchers donated by local businesses.In , the families committed to reading with their children for  minutes per day.The bookshoprsquos owner, Mel Grfin, said:\"We were delighted to be selected to participate in this exciting project. The idea was to encourage children to experience the joy of reading for pleasure, rather than seeing it as just something they have to do for school\"Research shows that being able to choose their own books, as well as sitting down regularly to read with a parent, makes a real dference to childrens enjoyment of reading. This in turn benefits their schoolwork across the whole curriculum, not just in literacy.\"We are also grateful to the local businesses who generously donated the coffee shop vouchers to help make this happen.ldquoThe contributions of local businesses show once again what great community spirit we have here in Penarth!\"In total,  local businesses donated coffee shop vouchers. This included The Bottle Shop and Loursquos for Men, who each sponsored one family for the six-week duration of the scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.
