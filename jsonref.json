A paper published by SAGE last week suggested two doses of the Pfizer vaccine is good enough to protect against all known variants.Public Health England\u0027s Dr Susan Hopkins said the agency was \u0027still investigating\u0027 the cases and added there is \u0027no evidence that the variant causes more severe disease or renders the vaccines currently deployed any less effective\u0027. \u0027The numbers are still low but certainly in London right now, B.1.617 and its subtypes are the only variant that appears to be growing,\u0027 Professor Pagel told MailOnline yesterday. \u0027That could be because it is outcompeting other strains, including the dominant Kent strain, or it could be circumstantial in that there were some spreading events that happened that, just by chance, were the Indian strain.\u0027However, I think the experience of India and now its neighbours do provide plenty of reason to be cautious and assume that B.1.617 is more transmissible.\u0027PHE has designated the Indian strains \u0027variants under investigation\u0027 because they are not well understood. The Kent and South Africa variants are \u0027variants of concern\u0027 because they are known to spread faster and escape some types of immunity – this means officials do surge testing to stamp out the South Africa variant when it\u0027s found, but they don\u0027t currently for India. Another 357,229 Covid cases and 3,449 new fatalities were recorded by the health ministry in India yesterday but medics believe the real figures could be between five and 10 times higher. Some have suggested the fast-spreading Kent variant could be behind the surge – similar patterns were seen when it took hold in the UK and Europe.But others say it was a perfect storm of rules that weren\u0027t tight enough, people\u0027s inability to keep social distancing and also new variants emerging. Data from the Wellcome Sanger Institute suggests it detected 100 test samples with the Indian variants in the most recent week, up from 52 in the week to April 10. This does not include tests from people travelling internationally.During that time the proportion of national cases they accounted for rose from one per cent to 2.4 per cent. Dr Pagel also said the proportion nationally was slightly higher, at around 4 per cent.This ate into the market share of the Kent variant, which fell from 97.8 to 96.2 per cent of cases. The Brazil and South Africa variants together account for less than one per cent.They have now been found in dozens of local authorities across the country with hotspots in London and the Midlands, and Public Health England has officially confirmed 400 infections caused by the viruses.As well as Lambeth (46 per cent of cases) and Harrow (36 per cent), the Indian variants also made up large proportions in Eastleigh, Hampshire (31 per cent) Bromley (25 per cent) Bolton (24 per cent) Stafford, Haringey and Hounslow (22 per cent).Professor Pagel: \u0027It rapidly became dominant in India and, again the sequenced data there is sparse, but early modelling shows that it might well be more transmissible than our B.117 Kent strain. \u0027What we have also seen in India is that B.1.617.2 is becoming the dominant subtype – exactly the same pattern we see here in the UK. \u0027While this could reflect the situation in India through importation, the Sanger data tries to exclude travel related cases or surge testing and we still the rise of B.1.617.2 in that.\u0027So we cannot be definitive. But that doesn\u0027t mean we should be complacent either – as so often with Covid, waiting to be absolutely sure is waiting too long.\u0027          Although the Sanger Institute data tries to filter out test results from people who have travelled internationally, its numbers likely reflect cases that are parts of clusters than began with a traveller.  India is now on Britain\u0027s red list, meaning only UK residents and citizens are allowed to make the journey into the country. They must quarantine for 10 days in a hotel and test themselves three times – before departure and then twice during self-isolation."},{"url":null,"title":"Commuting Britons likely catch Covid walking cycling work data suggests","story":"Share this article This result was based on a sample size of 10,516 people who were sent a Covid swab between March 20 and April 16. Just 31 tested positive.For those getting to work via car or taxi the risk was 30 per cent - based on swabs of 64,122 people, of which 160 were positive.Those who went to work by train or bus were found to be 8 per cent less likely to test positive than people working from home. But only 5,773 people were included in this group and just 10 were diagnosed with the virus, creating wide confidence intervals.The ONS said that because of this, the risk compared to working from home could be as high as 90 per cent.Riding in a train or bus was the most risky method of transport for every month bar one since the study started in October 3 last year.During all of the UK nations\u0027 various national lockdowns public transport was restricted for all but essential travel.Even though the ban was lifted most recently on April 12, levels have still not bounced back to pre-pandemic figures, which is reflected in the ONS\u0027 findings.Employees were also told to work from home if possible, but that decision has now been left with employers to decide, despite vanishingly low infection numbers.  Professor Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, told MailOnline it is nearly impossible to draw too many conclusions as to which method of transport is safest from the ONS\u0027s dataset.He said: \u0027The interpretation is really, really difficult. That’s for two reasons. \u0027First, there are huge confidence intervals (margins of statistical error) around these estimates, and that’s fundamentally because very few people in the ONS samples are testing positive these days.\u0027There were only 10 people in the ONS sample who travelled by bus or train and tested positive in the March to April 16 period. You’re never going to be able to get precise estimates from 10 positive tests.\u0027The second reason is there are differences between people who use different means of transport to work apart from their transport means, he said.Professor McConway added: \u0027So we can’t even be sure that the means of travel actually causes any difference at all to the risk. \u0027My guess would be that it probably does, but these results can’t show that. \u0027So, for instance, the data can’t tell you whether someone who currently travels by bike would be safer if they travelled by train or bus instead, because we don’t know enough about what causes the observed differences in risks. \u0027It might make no difference at all to their risk, or it might make a big difference.\u0027He said travelling by public transport is \u0027surely safer than it was\u0027 because cases are now so low.But he warned that as offices open up again and people return to work, it is possible trains and buses would become crowded again and the risk of transmission could rise.Dr Joe Grove, a virologist at University College London, told MailOnline: \u0027It’s difficult to think of a mechanism by which the risk associated with bus and train would drop whilst other modes of transport stayed the same. \u0027What is clear is that the national risk continues to drop — irrespective of what you’re doing — thanks to lockdown and vaccination, and we should keep up the hard work and be optimistic for the future.\u0027Boris Johnson urged to consider lifting \u0027work from home\u0027 guidance next month"},{"url":null,"title":"Coronavirus real world data proves Pfizer Covid jab 77 98 effective","story":"Share this article  Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: \u0027It\u0027s very positive...

I didn’t think about the terroir of grape-growing, the nose of whisky or what wine to pair with raw tilapia. On sunny days, I just thought about the most enjoyable way to quench my thirst. Now, the clank of a metal bottle opener and the hiss of a cold Thatchers Cider opening is enough to bring me back to the Meadows in Edinburgh, for a post-lecture picnic with friends. Stretched out on the grass as the rays warm my skin, the air is filled with the smoky smell of barbecue. Summer walks have been made all the sweeter with a sip of cider at the end. Arriving at a sweep of beach, blanket at the ready, or settling at the end of a pier as the sun sets. The cool fizz of cider tickling down my throat while the sky streaks violet and hazy pink is an unbeatable feeling. On an emotional level, clinking bottles with a friend at the end of the day is the perfect reward. On a practical level, a couple of bottles of ice-cold Thatchers in your rucksack on the way to the sea cools your back – ideal. Cider is the taste of a barbecue with my family – the only way we were allowed to see each other in summer 2020. My dad cooked venison burgers for the first time, an attempt to impress me, the “food and drink writer”, making jokes about not wanting a bad review. Despite the burger buns being a bit frozen in the middle, I gave it 1010. The sun was shining, family was gathered, the cider was flowing and for a brief second it felt like normality again. The epitome of the “better times” we’re all looking forward to. I can’t always suppress the drinks writer in me and did have to note that the iron-y tang of venison burgers goes particularly well with the light sweetness of Thatchers Katy. On the slopes of the Mendip Hills, Thatchers grows 458 different varieties of apple in perfect conditions – more than 25 varieties of them are used for ciders. The autumnal rain, summer sun and lack of winter frost combine to create juicy, flavour-filled apples. They have a cider for every taste bud: sharp and cloudy, sweet and pink. As a drinks writer, I’ve sampled more ciders than I care to remember. Thatchers Katy is the choice for sunny days and balmy nights. While Thatchers’ other ciders are made from a combination of different types of apple, Thatchers Katy is made from just one type. Red as a fairytale apple and sweet as strawberries, Katy apples are the pride of the crop and first to be run through the mill. It’s what you want to be drinking to get that real thirst-quenching moment, with only a hint of sweetness that doesn’t overpower. It sits between sweet and dry, with a crisp finish, so it’s incredibly drinkable. Being an apple-based drink, it goes best with anything pork. But its lightness also carries well with salads and summer food. Think charcuterie boards laden with spicy salami, salty prosciutto, and garlicky mortadella. The slight sweetness to Thatchers Katy cuts through the saltiness of prosciutto beautifully. Hand-held picnic food – scotch eggs, sausage rolls, and pork pies – tends to be savoury-heavy, so goes down a treat with a sweet cider, paired best with a sunset view, of course. But it also mixes well with fruity dishes – a salad sprinkled with glistening pomegranate seeds and topped with ripe avocado. The delicate fizz works particularly well with the creamy squish of avocado. Meat and salad, barbecues and picnic food it’s as though Thatchers Katy was designed for summer. So, it’s no wonder cider is the British summer drink of choice it pairs naturally with grilled meat and fruity salads, it’s easy to drink, and that hit of sweet apple sings of good times. For me, cider evokes memories of barbecues with friends and family, sunsets over the sea and picnics in the park, and Thatchers Katy is my cider of choice this summer, for its strawberry sweetness and crisp finish. If you need me, I’ll be sipping a cold cider in the park, or on my way to the shore, two bottles clinking away and cooling my back. To better times.

Economist Julian Jessop says the recovery is gathering pace: EY Club’s Howard Archer says the economy made a ‘robust’ start to the April-June quarter. Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, says “a surge of pent up demand has started to flow through the UK economy” as pandemic restrictions lift. The vaccination programme is boosting business confidence, he adds, meaning some firms can’t find enough workers: The latest Service PMI, which tracks activity across the sector, has jumped to 61.0 for April, its highest reading since October 2013 (any reading over 50 shows growth). Companies say they saw a sharp increase in business and consumer spending last month. New projects and forward booking jumped, with new orders rising at their fastest rate since December 2013. IHS Markit, which compiles the report, says services companies reported a jump in demand as pandemic restrictions were eased, and optimism about the economic outlook rose. Firms also took on more staff to handle this surge in orders - with employment growth accelerating to its fastest since October 2015.  At 61.0, the services PMI was much stronger than March’s 56.3, and also above a ‘flash estimate’ of 60.1 during April, suggesting activity picked up towards the end of the month.German factories have reported a jump in orders for the third month in a row, as its manufacturing sector continues to shine despite the pandemic. Luxury carmaker Aston Martin has reported a jump in sales that helped it cut its losses. Aston Martin sold 1,353 vehicles in the first quarter of 2021, with the launch of its first sport utility vehicle, the DBX, boosting sales. Aston Martin was rescued from collapse in January 2020 by billionaire fashion tycoon Lawrence Stroll, who says he’s “delighted with the great progress”. Aston Martin is sticking with its current guidance for 2021, adding: Reuters has the details:  Barratt says it has seen strong customer demand, with the underlying market also robust. Mortgage lending surged after the first lockdown lifted, with the stamp duty holiday boosting demand, and helping to drive prices to record levels. Speaking of Barratt....The Economist’s Duncan Weldon recently looked at the rise of housing estates around the country, and the impact of ‘Barratt Britain’. And this is having an impact on the political landscape of the country (timely, as we head to the polls today), Weldon added: The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors reports today that Britain’s construction sector is seeing the biggest increase in its workload in five years, due to strong demand for housing and the resumption of other projects. Materials shortages are the biggest challenge for construction sector growth this year as the industry continues its recovery from the covid-19 pandemic, RICS warns.UK retail chain Next has hiked its profit guidance, having seen stronger trading than expected in recent weeks as the lockdown lifted. Next has increased its central guidance for full year profit before tax by £20m to £720m, after making £75m more “full price sales” than expected. It had already raised its profit forecast once this year, at the start of April. Almost all of Next’s high street shops were closed under the lockdown, with the majority reopening on 12 April when curbs on non-essential stores were lifted. But it warns that this boost probably won’t last: This chart, from Jefferies, also shows how UK economic activity picked up in April as some lockdown rules were eased. The Bank of England sets UK interest rates at noon today, against the backdrop of an economic recovery as the country slowly emerges from lockdown and more people are vaccinated. Private sector growth is the fastest in years, mortgage lending is at a record, and economists are predicting the biggest bounce in GDP since the 1940s. Investors are also upbeat. The FTSE 100 share index hit its highest level in over a year yesterday, with mining giants, oil companies and banks among the risers -- all companies who benefit from a global rebound. So with the economic picture brightening, the BoE is expected to raise its growth forecasts today, in its latest Monetary Policy Report (also released at noon). Elsa Lignos of RBC predicts that the Bank will predict a smaller spike in unemployment this year: But...the Monetary Policy Committee will be pondering when it should slow, or taper, its £895bn asset purchase stimulus programme, which is buying up around £4.4bn of government bonds each week. Any hawkish signals about that could also sent the pound higher (it’s currently trading at $1.39). Shamik Dhar, chief economist at BNY Mellon Investment Management, says the prospects for the UK economy “look bright”.   But the economy won’t return to its pre-Covid state, of course, Dhar adds: European stocks are expected to open a little higher, with new eurozone construction data, the final UK services PMI for April, and the weekly US jobless report also coming up.

For a bite-size section, head to pretty Perros-Guirec, two hours’ drive from Saint-Malo, being sure to try traditional galettes at Crêperie du Ranolien, before hiking the Pink Granite coast, with its rosy boulders reminiscent of Seychelles. Alternatively head for the Crozon peninsula, a three-hour drive cross-country from the port, for lovely swimming creeks and imposing headlands jutting into water the colour of mouthwash. The island loop one: Belle-Île-en-Mer, BrittanyWho knew there was a tiny island paradise so close to home, where white sands meet turquoise waves, lighthouses decorate promontories and sweet seaside cottages are painted candy colours. A little like a French take on the Isles of Scilly, Belle-Île-en-Mer has long attracted creatives such as Claude Monet, who painted its imposing Port Coton needles, and one of the early stars of the screen, the bohemian actress Sarah Bernhardt, who moved into the military fort here in 1894, hosting glamorous parties, with Edward VII among her guests. The fort is now a little museum, in a beautiful spot on the Pointe des Poulains, one of the highlights of the 51-mile coastal path that circles Brittany’s largest island. The path threads together the sheltered coves of the east, steep cliffs in the south, dunes for children to tumble down, and Le Palais harbour. Le Palais, the island’s main town, is where you’ll arrive if you take the hour-long ferry ride from Quiberon on the mainland. Ride the bus to different sections of the path and be sure to have an evening cocktail at Le Grand Large hotel, overlooking the sea. The magical forest one: Brittany’s mythical forestHolidays to Brittany are very often all about the sea, but there are magical walking routes too in the interior’s marshes, forests and hills. Brittany’s once-vast forest of Paimpont, west of Rennes, is thought to be the one referred to in medieval folklore and myths as Brocéliande, an enchanted, fairy-filled forest associated with Arthurian legends. Today, themed trails and a museum at the Château de Comper bring the stories to life, adding an ethereal slant to family walks on the forest’s network of fern-lined trails. Your closest base could be Brittany’s vibrant capital, Rennes, an hour’s drive south from the ferry port at St Malo. The dramatic one: Normandy’s Alabaster coast on the GR21For anyone yearning to tackle one of Europe’s mammoth GR hiking trails there couldn’t be a handier starting point than that of Normandy’s iconic GR21, which begins in the city of Le Havre, arrival port for the Brittany Ferries crossing from Portsmouth. Whether you ditch your car immediately and strike out to walk the full 115-mile route north to the fishing village of Le Tréport, which usually takes seven to 10 days, or drive to stroll shorter sections, is a matter for you and your thigh muscles to decide. The geology of this stretch echoes that on the other side of the Channel, with dramatic high white chalk cliffs earning it the moniker the Alabaster coast. While the beaches of Normandy might still be associated with the noisy barrages of D-day, now only the wind tussling the leaves and the odd gull call will prick your ears, leaving mental space for contemplation on a peaceful route voted best hiking trail in France in 2019’s annual French Hiking Federation survey. The path doesn’t always follow the coast due to the fragility of the cliffs, but descends often to beaches and villages tucked into ravines where rivers meet the sea, such as Fécamp, with an abbey, and Dieppe, with wonderful seafood restaurants. Look out too for second world war sites and Delacroix’s painting subject, St Pierre-en-Port. Just a little past Le Tréport, the lovely belle epoque seaside resort of Mers-les-Bains, with quaint bathing huts on a lively seafront, is a fabulous place to finish up. The boozy one: Normandy’s cider routeWhether you stagger it, swagger it or dart along like a teetotal hare, the 25-mile cider route is a beauty, connecting more than 20 cider farms in the lovely Pays d’Auge region of lower Normandy. Densely wooded hills, villages of colourful timber-framed houses, chateaux and farmland comprise a gorgeous backdrop for immersion in the appley booze-making expertise of the area. You’ll learn to appreciate the slightly bitter flavour of local ciders – neither sandpaper dry or juicy-sweet – perfect for quenching the thirst of parched hikers. Calvados (apple brandy), sometimes mixed with apple juice to make pommeau, has to be tasted along with perries and cheeses. Where should you base yourself? Try any of the characterful hotels in ancient towns such as Cambremer. The cultural one: the Loire estuary The Loire river may be most famous for the beautiful chateaux that decorate its banks, but many other interesting features lend it character as it wends its way west to the Atlantic. At its finale, a wide estuary forms a fascinating natural and semi-industrial environment that’s fun to explore on foot. A 37-mile trail through the estuary from Nantes to the ocean, takes in fishing villages, nature reserves and a fantastic art trail, the Estuaire Nantes\u0026lt\u0026gtSaint-Nazaire, featuring 33 mind-bending sculptures, dotted along the water’s edge. Picking out one section for a day’s walk, you might opt for the lively 11-mile stretch from Paimbœuf, a village of brightly coloured houses, to the seaside resort of Saint-Brevin-les-Pins, on the southern side opposite Saint-Nazaire. It offers sandy beaches, fishing huts on stilts and the art trail’s “Serpent d’Ocean” by Huang Yong Ping, a huge skeleton of a sea serpent submerged in the breakers that’s thrilling for children. Alternatively there are dozens of other shorter walking trails of a few miles throughout the southern estuary area, which are easily doable for little legs. The hilly one: the Alpes MancellesFor not-too-tough hiking challenges in a mountainous region that resembles a mini version of the Alps, head to the pretty Alpes Mancelles in the Atlantic Loire. The mountains here top out at only 200-400m, bless them, so are relatively easy to conquer, but will still earn you the kudos of having summited some of the highest peaks in western France. Le Mont des Avaloirs, at 416m, is the big boy of the region, providing wonderful views of the Sarthe river from a Brutalist-style concrete lookout point at the top. Across the unspoilt massif, hundreds of kilometres of paths explore wooded slopes and valleys, and loop from authentic villages such as Fresnay-sur-Sarthe, a medieval town on a rocky outcrop with a ninth century chateau to visit. There’s tons for families to do too, from hiking with donkeys to high-ropes courses in the trees.

PA report that the basic Tui package will include a lateral flow test for pre-departure to the UK, and a PCR test to be taken post-arrival in the UK. Andrew Flintham, the travel firm’s managing director for the UK and Ireland, said: “We have always believed that cost-effective testing solutions, as well as maximum flexibility, will make travel a possibility this summer and beyond. “Our research has shown that customers are looking forward to their much-needed holiday overseas, but affordable and easy testing solutions was imperative to make this a reality. The four new exclusive testing packages have been developed with our customers in mind they’re offered at greatly reduced prices, include certification to travel and will be a simple process from start to finish.”Nicole Winfield reports for Associated Press that the conference, which begins Thursday and ends Saturday with a virtual audience with the pope, was planned well before the pandemic erupted, and is being held after being postponed last year. Fauci, who is leading the US pandemic response, told the online conference in recorded remarks that the pandemic had confirmed to him that faith and science are constantly evolving — and that scientists in particular must humbly admit they don’t have all the answers all the time. One answer Fauci said he did have was that the key to overcoming current vaccine hesitancy is pairing the right medical message with the right messenger.“You have someone who’s a deeply religious person who will listen to their clergy. That’s different than me with a suit going into an area telling people to do something,” he said. He was referring to the religiously inspired resistance to taking Covid-19 vaccines that were indirectly developed using lines of cells derived from aborted fetuses. The Vatican has declared that all Covid-19 vaccines are not only morally licit, but that people have a moral responsibility to get the jabs to protect others. To back his point on the potency of messages from spiritual leaders, yesterday we were reporting that Iraq’s vaccine rollout had been faltering, but that images of a populist Shiite cleric’s public endorsement of vaccinations have spurred on his supporters to get the jab. At the Vatican event Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel will be speaking about the mRNA technology behind Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine, while his counterpart at Pfizer, Albert Bourla, is heading up a discussion on preparedness for future global health crises.Agrence France-Presse have produced this summing up of the arguments. Some countries see the temporary intellectual property (IP) rights waiver as a shortcut to ending the coronavirus pandemic. But the pharmaceutical industry claims an IP waiver will not help produce a single dose more this year. The original plan proposed a temporary exemption from certain IP obligations so that any country can produce vaccines without worrying about patents. The waiver would also cover “industrial designs, copyright and protection of undisclosed information”, and would last “until widespread vaccination is in place globally, and the majority of the world’s population has developed immunity”. More than 80 countries support the proposal, including Argentina, Bangladesh, the DR Congo, Kenya, Nigeria and Venezuela. Egypt, Indonesia, Morocco and Pakistan are among a host of countries that have indicated they have production capacity available if the patents are waived. A number of NGOs including the medical charity Doctors Without Borders back the waiver, saying it would facilitate timely access to affordable medical products for all countries in need. The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations is, naturally, strongly against the proposal. “A waiver is the simple but the wrong answer to what is a complex problem,” the IFPMA big pharma lobby group said, branding the US decision to support the plan “disappointing”. “Waiving patents of Covid-19 vaccines will not increase production nor provide practical solutions.” The IFPMA claim the real challenge in scaling up production is eliminating trade barriers, and addressing the supply chain bottlenecks and scarcity of raw materials - and argues introducing new manufacturers will not help. Larger firms also suggest that vaccine confidence could be undermined by a free-for-all on production. There will now undoubtedly be months of negotiations – and acres of op-eds and pressure from both sides – before a consensus can be found at the World Trade Organization in Geneva. Earlier today European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said that the trading bloc was ready to discuss the proposal. The idea has the backing of World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who hailed the US support as a “monumental moment” in the pandemic fight. “Ultimately, the solution to the vaccine crisis is for the countries and companies that control the global supply to share... technology, know-how and to waive intellectual property rights,” he said yesterday. Health minister Jens Spahn announced on Wednesday night he would push to scrap the priority order for the British-Swedish company’s vaccine at a meeting with German state leaders on Thursday. Spahn also said he would seek to reduce the interval between the first and the second dose of the Oxford-developed vaccine from 12 to four weeks. Some German states, including Berlin, Bavaria and Saxony, have already scrapped prioritisation rules around the AstraZeneca vaccine. In the German capital, some GPs even offer walk-in jabs for patients who aren’t registered with their clinic. Several reported cases of a rare blood-clotting disorder in people who had received the vaccine led Germany in March to limit the use of AstraZeneca to people aged 60 or older, and doctors report continued scepticism around the product. Health minister Spahn on Wednesday appealed to the over 60s to take the jab if it was offered to them, and emphasised that the risk of side effects even among younger people was “very, very low”.They report that around one in three people in England aged 50 and over identifying as black Caribbean are unlikely to have received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine. Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers’ Association confirmed on Thursday night that players, coaches, officials and commentators were en route from India to the Males. But Mike Hussey, who is an assistant coach at Chennai Super Kings, was unable to travel with the group as he continues to serve a 10-day isolation period in a Delhi hotel after testing positive for Covid-19. The length of the Australian contingent’s stopover in the Males, where Australian commentator Michael Slater fled to earlier this week, may be determined during a meeting of Australia’s national cabinet on Friday. The worst-case scenario for Pat Cummins and compatriots would be an extension of the ban on travellers from India, meaning they would need to spend a fortnight in the Males then a further two weeks in Australia’s hotel quarantine system. Sharon Peacock, head of the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium (COG-UK) and professor of public health and microbiology at the University of Cambridge, said it could be the case that coronavirus mutates to become less infectious, though she warned it could take years for it to become like the common cold. Asked whether a variant will emerge somewhere across the globe that is resistant to current vaccines, she said: “We haven’t seen anything like that to date, and the question you’re asking is the million dollar question in many ways, everybody wants to know what’s the likelihood and when is it likely to occur, if at all.” “What we don’t know is if it is likely to occur. We know that as mutations accumulate in the virus, it can actually make it more fit in terms of avoiding our immune system, but the more mutations it accumulates, it could actually lead to a virus that is less infectious. So there’s a trade-off for the virus in terms of how many mutations it can tolerate. Jane Kirby, PA’s health editor, notes she said: “Now, some people have predicted that a virus could emerge that is pretty resistant to vaccines, but we haven’t seen any hint of that at the moment. And the key thing is to get on and vaccinate the world so that we can clamp down. If we can reduce disease rates, then we reduce the risk of variants arising in the first place.” Prof Peacock suggested richer nations should be doing all they can to help vaccinate people in poorer countries. She said: “We in wealthy countries should be thinking about people who are less fortunate than ourselves,” and added: “We should be vaccinating the world on a moral standpoint, but also vaccinating the world to try and reduce the rate of infection, so that we protect people from an untimely death, but also reduce the risk of variants emerging in the first place, because ultimately in the long-term, that is one of the major threats to us controlling this pandemic.” Asked whether Covid will become like annual seasonal flu, she said: “The idea that the virus will become like a common cold and nobody will notice it by next spring is far too optimistic. And so it could take one or two generations before we see a virus that starts to, what we say attenuate, which means it causes less severe disease, and so, I think, what we have to do is tackle the problem that’s in front of us at the moment and not put too much store in the fact that the virus is going to evolve into something that’s really rather harmless.Russia had already sent 15,000 doses of the vaccine to the former Soviet republic last month, Lavrov was quoted as saying at a meeting with his Armenian counterpart. Armenia’s population is fewer than 3 million people.New Zealand will pause quarantine-free travel from New South Wales from midnight Thursday (NZST), after two community Covid cases were detected in Sydney. The NZ Covid response minister, Chris Hipkins, told reporters the suspension would initially last 48 hours, while the source of infection in the two Sydney cases was investigated. Hipkins said the pause would be “under constant review”, and if more information came to light that prompted officials to reopen sooner or to extend the pause, then they would do so. At this stage, it applies only to New South Wales, not all of Australia, and will not affect those flying from New Zealand to NSW – only those coming in the opposite direction. Hipkins said the government was aware it would cause disruption for travellers, but was erring on the side of caution. “We’ve weighed this up very carefully,” he said. “I’m confident we’ll know more in the next 24-48 hours,” he said. A man in Sydney tested positive for the virus on Wednesday. On Thursday, Australian health officials confirmed that his wife had also tested positive. Genomic testing has linked those cases to a likely case at the border – but officials have not yet been able to find a clear chain of transmission. That has raised concerns that there could be a “missing link” case between the border and the community cases, which has not yet been identified.

That’s why we are ready to discuss how the US proposal for a waiver on intellectual property protections for Covid-19 vaccines could help achieve that objective.” She was speaking to the European University Institute in Florence. In the video address, she also said that, “In the short run, however, we call upon all vaccine-producing countries to allow exports.”The ban prevents Australians who have been in India in the previous 14 days from returning to Australia, with threats of fines and jail time if they return. The government says it was enacted in response to the high number of cases of Covid-19 in India but since it was announced, Morrison has been in damage control against accusations the policy is racist. On Tuesday, the prime minister launched three sponsored videos on Facebook, including subtitles in Hindi and Punjabi, where he talks directly to the camera about the ban. In the nearly nine-minute-long video, Morrison notes the Indian community in Australia is a “generous and kind community” going through a difficult time. “I know this is a time of great pain and great fear, as many families in Australia have lost ones in India,” he says in the video. “You know we are witnessing in India an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe.” But he explained the decision to ban returning Australians from India on the basis of medical advice. He said the “temporary” pause would be reconsidered on 15 May, and reviewed every day before then. The online advertising push comes as immigration minister Alex Hawke holds a series of roundtable meetings with Indian community leaders in Australia to explain the policy and hear their concerns. He held his sixth meeting on Thursday. Read more of Josh Taylor’s report here: Scott Morrison targets Australian-Indian community with Facebook ads explaining travel ban “This is a global health crisis,” Katherine Tai, the US trade representative, said in a written statement. “The extraordinary circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic call for extraordinary measures. “The administration strongly believes in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for Covid-19 vaccines. We will actively participate in text-based negotiations at the WTO needed to make that happen.” Reuters report that in a response this morning, the GAVI vaccine alliance has welcomed Biden’s support, and urged Washington to help manufacturers to also transfer know-how to boost global production urgently. “We recognise also the significance of the (Biden) administration’s commitment to work towards increasing raw material production, which will have an immediate impact on alleviating current global supply constraints,” the Geneva-based group that co-leads the global Covax dose-sharing facility told Reuters in a statement. The waiver will not take place immediately as it has to be approved by consensus at the World Trade Organization (WTO), but the decision of the Biden administration to throw its weight behind a waiver will have a strong influence on the outcome of that decision. Dan Whitehead writes for Sky that NHS England has spent £34m on opening 83 clinics, but did not have figures available on how many people are using the clinics.

Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine.

Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar told his parliamentary party that indoor dining could return in July with six people to a table, contact details taken and allowances made for the size of venues. He said a decision would be taken next month. It comes as the Government prepares to discuss extensions and adjustments to key business and wage supports. The Cabinet subcommittee on economic recovery, chaired by the Tánaiste, will on Thursday meet to discuss the future of multibillion-euro subsidies due to expire this summer. The National Economic Recovery Plan will also be on the agenda. Additional supports for severely impacted business sectors will also be considered as part of the discussions, which are preliminary.No ‘cliff-edge’Sources emphasised that there would be no “cliff edge” to the schemes, and the intention is that they will stay in place to allow businesses to recover, especially those which are closed or restricted, and to allow employment to recover. However, senior sources also said the programmes could not stay in place indefinitely, especially as firms reopen fully under a hoped-for permanent easing of Covid restrictions.Discussions are expected to focus on plans for the second half of the year for supports such as the commercial rates waiver, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS).However, any restructuring of the schemes would have to be weighed against uncertainty over the wider epidemiological situation, sources said. Elsewhere, the Government continues to consider a new plan to offer the AstraZeneca and Johnson \u0026ampJohnson vaccines to those under 50. Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said advice on the use of the vaccines indicated they could be used in this way. Discussions on the plan are underway, and he said he expects to have proposals to be considered by Government this week.

Our priority is first-time buyers.” Video: OireachtasNew homes at Mullen Park, Maynooth, Co Kildare. Round Hill, a multinational investment company, is in discussions to buy 115 homes at the development. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Government will move to block investment funds from buying up entire housing estates, according to senior figures involved in the process.Discussions are continuing within Government as to how best to implement the policy, but senior Coalition sources confirmed that the move had been agreed between the parties.The decision comes after fierce Opposition criticism of the Government on the housing issue, following reports that entire developments of family homes had been bought by investment funds, a trend that Opposition parties and housing campaigners said was squeezing families out of the housing market.Both Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar yesterday expressed their unhappiness with the practice, with Mr Martin telling the Dáil that it was “unacceptable” and “will be examined”.But sources involved in behind-the-scenes discussions said the party leaders had taken the decision to bring the practice to an end and officials were examining ways of doing this. Senior officials are examining the options, though some sources fear that the process could be fraught with legal difficulties.While there has been widespread Opposition criticism of the role that investment funds have played in the property market, there is a belief in Government that they should not be chased out of the market as they have an important role to play in providing funding for certain types of developments. Government sources briefed that they wanted them to fund “extra builds” that would not otherwise take place. There is little opposition in Government to the funds financing large-scale apartment developments for rental in urban areas.‘Original intention’However, Ministers and senior officials have been alarmed by reports of entire housing estates being bought up, though there is legally nothing to stop the funds from doing so. One source said the funds were needed for their “original intention” but not for “plucking supply that is already there”.Under fire from Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald in the Dáil, Mr Martin said institutional investors were brought in “to add supply, not to displace supply” of housing and they had to “distinguish between good capital and bad capital”.“We do not want institutional investors competing with first-time buyers,” Mr Martin stressed.Earlier Mr Varadkar weighed in, saying investment funds mostly invested in apartment buildings before or during construction but there had been a change in recent months to whole housing estates or part of them.He said: “It was never intended that they would enter into that part of the market and are taking away properties that could be bought by first-time buyers or upgraders . . . It’s working against the principle of home ownership.”But Opposition parties continued to savage the Government on the issue. “It is government policy to incentivise and support private investment funds to buy up housing across the state. It is government policy to keep a whole generation locked out of affordable housing,” Ms McDonald said in a tweet, during a day when housing policy dominated sharp exchanges in the Dáil.Mr Martin also said that local authorities should not be effectively underwriting investments by property funds by promising long leases for social housing once the developments were complete, as has happened in some cases.“I want to be very clear about this that no county council should be on the other side of this engaging in long leases with these institutional investors,” Mr Martin said.There was some merit in short-term limited leases “but leasing overall long-term doesn’t represent great value”.Mr Martin said he had spoken to the Ministers for finance, public expenditure and housing about the matter and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe “will meet colleagues this afternoon on this”. However, The  understands that discussions have quickly moved on to banning the practice."},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord government in a flap about the cuckoo in the property nest","story":"“How are ordinary house buyers who scrimp and save for a mortgage supposed to compete with this?” File photograph: iStock The Taoiseach was right to look concerned.A new strain has emerged.“There is something new in what happened over the weekend. There is no point in saying there isn’t because there is,” he informed Cian O’Callaghan of the Social Democrats.A new strain of the old greed.This could be called the “Maynooth variant” although a number of TDs say it isn’t new but an infection which has been slowly but steadily taking root under the eye of recent governments in a dangerously weakening market.“Insidious” is what Labour’s Duncan Smith called it.Micheál Martin identified this new strain during Leaders’ Questions. Like all the others it came from the liquid Reit market and is spread by cuckoos and vultures, but the big difference to look out for here is the emergence of bulk-buying of completed housing schemes.And swooping. Swooping in and scooping up.“Unacceptable,” he said. “Not acceptable.”Investment companies should not be purchasing entire suburban estates. His Government is absolutely opposed to this.The Taoiseach’s sincerity was genuine. As was his obvious concern, not just for the inidual victims of the Maynooth variant and other financial mutations, but for his administration’s future and his own political skin.He will be aware of the disgusted reaction to the Business Post’s weekend revelation of an investment vehicle called Round Hill Capital sneakily nipping in and snaffling all but 22 out of 174 new homes in a Kildare housing estate, shouldering shocked inidual buyers aside with its massive buying power.So he will be aware that this sort of practice has to be stopped, not only to help first-time buyers find a home but also to stem the public anger over the unfair, inequitable and dysfunctional state of the housing market here.Raging contagionAt least an effective vaccine exists now for coronavirus, while opposition criticism of the Coalition’s handling of the pandemic has always been tinged with the cautious awareness that a raging contagion is oblivious to the rule of politics.If only the same could be said for the housing crisis, which was very much with us before the pandemic and looks well set to outlast it. The climate allowing global real estate investment trusts (Reits) to flourish was engineered nearly 10 years ago by Fine Gael minister for finance Michael Noonan when he introduced tax breaks to encourage these companies to invest here and boost an economy emerging from deep recession.And in they poured.They weren’t supposed to go mad looking for money by milking the lovely tax breaks until too many suffered and too many noticed. They should have confined themselves to reaping lucrative returns from commercial property and nondescript apartment blocks full of students, young buckos and renters who can’t afford to buy their own place.They weren’t supposed to start muscling in on proper suburban houses built for people who want to raise a family and set down strong roots in the electoral register.But Darragh is all set to move on the Reits. Rarin’ to go. He just needs to take a good run at it first.Further analysisHe told Morning Ireland on Tuesday that further analysis would have to be done before he acts. Outright banning of these companies (was anyone suggesting that?) “would be a pretty radical move and might have unintended consequences”.It was pointed out more than once to his boss in the Dáil on Wednesday that Germany managed to do it, banning such wholesale investment in specific areas of housing as opposed to the entire property market.Cian O’Callaghan reminded the Taoiseach that the Construction Industry Federation said in 2009 that 95 per cent of new apartment builds in 2009 were bought by these funds. Was the Government only interested in protecting houses in the suburbs? What about apartments?This is when Micheál broke the news of the new variant – the purchasing of entire estates. New to him, that is.Social Democrat co-leader Catherine Murphy told him of other estates in Kildare which have been similarly bought over by these financial cuckoos who arrive with their fat chequebooks and special tax breaks and elbow out ordinary buyers from their chosen nest.“How are ordinary buyers who scrimp and save for a mortgage supposed to compete with this?”The Government has to do something. People who hoped to buy one of the new houses had no chance. The local council couldn’t match the swooping vultures either and the local housing trusts, also interested in acquiring some of the homes, were bankrolled out of buying by the cuckoos.“There’s a skewed ideology at play here,” she said, promising that “every one of us” would sit overnight or for the weekend if they had to pass legislation.The Taoiseach was very sympathetic. “In respect of that swoop-in by that investor, we are going to deal with that. That is not acceptable.”Factory shipsBut it gets worse. These Reits are like international factory ships, steaming into Ireland and indiscriminately hoovering up all sorts of housing stock.Duncan Smith revealed that first-time buyers are not just losing out on new homes. The investment funds are leaving young couples “absolutely devastated” by sniffing out second-hand homes that might be within the reach of first-time buyers and offering over the odds before they even hit the market.Sinn Féin, particularly its housing spokesman Eoin O’Broin, has been calling for a number of years for the tax loopholes which give these global financial machines a huge advantage over local buyers to be closed. Richard Boyd Barrett of People Before Profit has also long complained about the actions of the funds and brought the personal stories of powerless people’s lives turned upside down by them.Mary Lou McDonald was the first at Leaders’ Questions to demand action, and quickly, from the Government. She was followed by a succession of speakers from all Opposition parties.Even the venerable Bernard Durkan, Fine Gael stalwart, wanted to know what emergency legislation is planned. As a Kildare TD he is well aware of the housing heartbreak in the constituency.Outside the Dáil, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar limply said the situation is “undesirable”.Meanwhile, Darragh (let’s not be too radical) O’Brien said what is needed is “a whole-of-government approach”.The Taoiseach indicated that O’Brien, along with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure, was working on a plan. But despite fevered demands from the Opposition to hear more, details there came none.In a novel twist, Labour Senator Rebecca Moynihan promised the party will introduce Darragh O’Brien’s 2019 Bill “word for word” if he doesn’t do it himself before the end of the week.Time for the Government to swoop and put this bad cuckoo back in its clock.Otherwise it will be the voters who are calling time."},{"url":null,"title":"canada authorises pfizer covid 19 vaccine for ages 12 to 15","story":"Pfizer vaccine  is first to be allowed to be administered to people of younger age cohort in the country, the federal health ministry said on Wednesday. File photograph: Mehdi FedouachAFPCanada is authorising the use of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for use on children aged 12 to 15, the first doses to be allowed in the country for people that young, the federal health ministry said on Wednesday.Supriya Sharma, a senior adviser at the Canadian federal health ministry, said the Pfizer vaccine, produced with German partner BioNTech, was safe and effective in the younger age group.“We are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” she told reporters.Sharma and a health ministry spokesman said Canada was the first country to grant such an approval, but a Canadian representative for Pfizer later said Algeria permitted use of the vaccine for this age group in April. The Canadian health ministry said it had no information about the discrepancy.The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to take a similar step “very soon,” US health officials said.Separately, authorities reported the third death of a Canadian from a rare blood clot condition after receiving AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine. The man, who was in his 60s, lived in the Atlantic province of New Brunswick.Jennifer Russell, the chief medical officer of health in New Brunswick, said the province would continue using the AstraZeneca vaccine. Alberta reported a death from clotting on Tuesday and Quebec announced one on April 27th.“There will be rare cases where thrombosis will occur. However, the risks remain minimal compared to the risks, complications and potential consequences of Covid-19,” Russell told reporters.Inoculation bottlenecksCanada’s federal government has bought tens of millions of doses of vaccines but critics complain the pace of inoculation is lagging due to bottlenecks in the 10 provinces, which are responsible for administering the doses.Alberta will become the first province to offer Covid-19 vaccines to everyone aged 12 and over from May 10th, premier Jason Kenney said on Wednesday, a day after he introduced tighter public health measures to combat a third wave of the pandemic.Alberta, home to Canada’s oil patch, has the highest rate per capita of Covid-19 in the country, with nearly 24,000 active cases and 150 people in intensive care.About 20 per cent of the 1,249,950 cases of Covid-19 in Canada have been reported in people under the age of 19.

Photograph:  John ThysAFP via Getty ImagesOn Christmas Eve last year, as the Brexit negotiations were entering their final minutes, Michel Barnier sought out his British counterpart in a room in the European Commission’s Berlaymont headquarters.“After nine months of negotiations, it is the last time I would see David Frost and our final exchange is professional and cold,” Barnier, who was chief Brexit negotiator, writes in The Great Illusion: a secret Brexit diary (2016-2020)“He knows I know that until the last moment he has been trying to circumvent me by opening a parallel negotiating track with Ursula von der Leyen’s cabinet. And he knows it has not been successful.”Although he describes Frost as courteous, Barnier makes clear that he neither trusted the British negotiator nor admired his negotiating style. A few weeks earlier, when the British team were refusing to engage with issues of concern to the European side, Barnier told them their negotiating technique was a farce.Throughout his 500-page diary, which is published in French on Thursday and will appear in an English translation in October, Barnier is bewildered by the British approach to the talks. He never wavers from his conviction that Britain made a mistake in leaving the European Union but he is surprised again and again by the incompetence and self-delusion that informed London’s negotiating strategy.When Theresa May declared in Lancaster House that Britain wanted to leave the single market and the customs union but hoped to maintain many of their benefits, he could scarcely believe what he was hearing.“Have the consequences of these decisions been thought through, measured, discussed? Does she realise this rules out almost all forms of cooperation we have with our partners?” he writes.“I am amazed at the way the prime minister has shown her hand.”He is generous towards May, describing her as a courageous woman surrounded by a lot of men putting their personal interests ahead of those of their country. Boris Johnson was one of those men but Barnier is careful not to underestimate him and finds him to be an appealing, if “baroque”, personality.He enjoyed a warm relationship with David Davis but has little complimentary to say about the next Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, whom he describes as having a messianic glint in his eye.When Raab demanded that the Irish Border issue should be resolved as part of an overall agreement, he warned that the EU would otherwise be responsible for the impact of a no-deal Brexit in the North.‘The fault of the UK’“We are searching for solutions together. And Dominic, if this threat is the new line of your government, then the negotiations can end immediately. And I will prepare myself in the coming days to inform the European Parliament and member states. We will regard the failure as being the fault of the UK,” Barnier told him.From the start, the issue of the Border was central to the talks and Barnier is at his most passionate when he describes his personal commitment to the peace process and his feelings when he met people in Northern Ireland.“I promised myself in this negotiation not to fuel the polemics and attacks from the British tabloids, to pay attention to the words I use, to stick to the facts, the figures, the legal fundamentals, in short, to leave little room for emotion and feelings, for the sake of objectivity. But here in Ireland . . . it is difficult not tobe touched by the sensitivity, the emotion of those who express themselves, the memories that remind me of this tragedy,” he writes.Barnier describes former Taoiseach Leo Varadkar as “courageous”, praising his role in the abortion rights referendum. Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney is “always shrewd, methodical and well-informed” and Barnier singles out John Callinan from the Taoiseach’s office and Ireland’s former EU ambassador Declan Kelleher for praise.While May was hamstrung by the need to negotiate every step in the Brexit talks with her own party, Barnier maintained unity among the EU’s member-states by frequent visits to capitals and open channels of communication to the leaders.Johnson’s indifference to the truth and his pursuit of “dead cat” strategies and staged crises complicated the negotiations and when Frost opened the second phase of negotiations he told Barnier that the prime minister did not feel bound by the political declaration he agreed alongside the withdrawal agreement.The Internal Market Act, which included clauses that would have allowed the British government to unilaterally suspend the Northern Ireland protocol, was the trigger for Barnier’s final loss of trust in his negotiating partners. He suggests that Johnson waited until Donald Trump’s election defeat before withdrawing the offending clauses, fearful of their impact on his relationship with Joe Biden.La Grande Illusion – Journal secret du Brexit (2016-2020) is published by Gallimard.

US president Joe Biden’s administration made the call for the waiver amid WTO talks on easing trade rules. File photograph: J Scott ApplewhiteAP PhotoBloombergUS president Joe Biden’s administration is throwing its support behind efforts to waive intellectual property protections for Covid-19 vaccines in an effort to speed the end of the pandemic.United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai announced the US government’s position in a Wednesday statement, amid World Trade Organisation talks over easing global trade rules to enable more countries to produce more of the life-saving vaccines.“The Administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for Covid-19 vaccines,” Ms Tai said in the statement.But she cautioned that it would take time to reach the required global “consensus” to waive the protections under WTO rules, and US officials said it would not have an immediate effect on the global supply of Covid-19 jabs.“This is a global health crisis, and the extraordinary circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic call for extraordinary measures,” said Ms Tai.“The Administration’s aim is to get as many safe and effective vaccines to as many people as fast as possible.”President Michael D Higgins has welcomed the move as one of “immense moral significance in international policy”. The President had criticised the international response to helping developing countries deal with the pandemic in a speech to mark May Day when he said that “in a most important respect, our solidarity at global level has been tested, and we have been found wanting”. But in a tweet late on Wednesday night, President Higgins praised the move by the US government to back the waiver: “This decision marks a moment of immense moral significance in international policy, putting global need ahead of any narrow considerations. “It has the potential to be exemplary, building hope in so many areas for a real new beginning in our mutual interdependence.” The WTO previously backed a similar waiver on vaccines to combating Aids and HIV in the past. The issue has been raised in recent weeks in the Dáil and Seanad as TDs and Senators urged the Government to use its influence to persuade the European Commission, which represents the EU at the WTO, to reverse its opposition to a waiver. Last week, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said there had been “too many simplistic conclusions drawn” on the issue. Ireland and the EU had shown moral leadership on the issue, he insisted, adding that Europe had led the charge in terms of vaccine production and export for the entire world. The EU through its pre-purchasing agreement “has done an awful lot to ensure proper research and production of vaccines, which are being exported all over the world, and the barriers have not been put up to stop it”.  The issue needed to be studied carefully because “the model that has evolved has resulted in unprecedented production of vaccines in record time”. Ms Tai’s announcement comes hours after WTO director-general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala spoke to a closed-door meeting of ambassadors from developing and developed countries that have been wrangling over the issue, but agree on the need for wider access to Covid-19 treatments, WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell said.Waiver panelThe WTO’s general council, made up of ambassadors, was taking up the pivotal issue of a temporary waiver for intellectual property protections on Covid-19 vaccines and other tools, which South Africa and India first proposed in October.The idea has gained support in the developing world and among some progressive politicians in the west.Mr Rockwell said a WTO panel on intellectual property was set to take up the waiver proposal again at a “tentative” meeting later this month, before a formal meeting on June 8th-9th.No consensus, which is required under WTO rules, was expected to emerge from the ambassadors’ two-day meeting on Wednesday and Thursday.But Mr Rockwell pointed to a change in tone after months of wrangling.“I would say that the discussion was far more constructive, pragmatic.“It was less emotive and less finger pointing than it had been in the past,” Mr Rockwell said, citing a surge in cases in places such as India.“I think that this feeling of everyone-being-in-it-together was being expressed in a way that I had not heard to this point.”Authors of the proposal, which has faced resistance from many countries with influential pharmaceutical and biotech industries, have been revising it in hopes of making it more palatable.Ms Okonjo-Iweala, in remarks posted on the WTO website, said it was “incumbent on us to move quickly to put the revised text on the table, but also to begin and undertake text-based negotiations”.“I am firmly convinced that once we can sit down with an actual text in front of us, we shall find a pragmatic way forward” that is “acceptable to all sides”, she said.Co-sponsors of the idea were shuttling between different diplomatic missions to make their case, according to a Geneva trade official who was not authorised to speak publicly on the matter.A deadlock persists, and opposing sides remain far apart, the official said.CopyrightThe argument, part of a long-running debate about intellectual property protections, centres on lifting patents, copyrights and protections for industrial design and confidential information to help expand the production and deployment of vaccines during supply shortages.The aim is to suspend the rules for several years, just long enough to beat down the pandemic.The issue has become more pressing with a surge in cases in India, the world’s second-most populous country and a key producer of vaccines, including one for Covid-19 that relies on technology from AstraZeneca. Proponents, including WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, note that such waivers are part of the WTO toolbox and insist there is no better time to use them than during the once-in-a-century pandemic that has taken 3.2 million lives, infected more than 437 million people and devastated economies.More than 100 countries have come out in support of the proposal, and a group of 110 members of US Congress, all fellow Democrats of Mr Biden, sent him a letter last month that called on him to support the waiver.Opponents say a waiver would be no panacea.They insist that production of coronavirus vaccines is complex and simply cannot be ramped up by easing intellectual property, and say lifting protections could hurt future innovation. – With Associated Press reportersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Politics latest news: French naval patrol ship heads to Jersey as fishermen blockade capitalCoronavirus latest news: Britain faces pressure to follow President Biden and waive patent on vaccinesTake your own pencil: new Covid-19 rules to expect at your local polling station today SNP 2021 manifesto: What Nicola Sturgeon\u0026#39s policies mean for Scottish independenceThe fisherman’s daughter with a \u0026#39pirate\u0026#39s soul\u0026#39 who threatened to turn off Jersey\u0026#39s power Will more bricks fall from the Red Wall?

an engineer incorrectly refuelled the aircraft, a report found.  The maintenance worker who didn\u0027t speak English as his first language had added nearly 38 times too much anti bacterial chemical into the Airbus A321-211 fuel on 23 February 2020, investigators found.Three days later, the airliner was forced to make an emergency landing after one engine caught fire and the other stalled resulting in it almost crashing near Gatwick airport.The disaster may only have been averted because the 236-seat plane was flying light with no passengers and just seven crew in quiet airspace and in clear conditions.The report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said that while the aircraft was being serviced at an overseas maintenance depot in Cyprus an engineer, who only spoke English as a second language, did not understand that \u0027ppm\u0027 meant \u0027parts per million’.The engineer, 52, who had never used biocide treatment before attempted to search the internet for the ‘ppm’ definition and then used an online calculator to try to figure out the correct amount, but was unable to recall which website he had used.He ended up pouring 30kgs of the anti bacterial chemical Kathon into each wing tank when he should have used 0.8kgs on each.The report found that he had also made an error by pouring the biocide directly into the tanks, so that it pooled in the bottom, rather than mixing it up with fuel and then putting it in.The plane then took off from Larnaca Airport, Cyprus to London Stansted Airport and problems with the two engines were noted over the course of its next few flights.But it wasn’t until its fourth flight when the plane took off from Gatwick airport to Stansted, that the pilot noticed that his number one engine was banging and surging at a height of 500ft.He told investigators how the Titan Airways jet was yawing...and fishtailing...all over the place as his cabin crew told him by intercom that flames were billowing out of the engine\u0027s tailpipe in the darkness.The 28-year-old pilot sent out a Mayday alert just 47 seconds after taking off and took manual control of the plane, making an emergency landing back at Gatwick at 12.20am on the 26th February, just 11 minutes after taking off.The report concluded that the excess quantity of Kathon treatment contaminated the fuel and caused the partial failure of the jet\u0027s engines due to the build up of residues.Investigators made safety recommendations, calling for the European Union Aviation Safety Agency to classify the use of biocide additives as a critical maintenance task and subject to tighter rules and procedures.The report said that Airbus was also in the process of replacing the term parts per million\u0027 or ppm in its maintenance literature to the more easily understood ml1,000ltrs.Crispin Orr, Chief Inspector of Air Accidents said: This was a very serious incident that in different circumstances could have had a catastrophic outcome.He added that it was “essential that maintenance regimes are resilient to errors that could lead to fuel system contamination.”Titan Airways have been contacted for comment.More from NewsMore

Troubles, Joe McCann, the gunman killed by paratroopers in 1972, had acquired a reputation as one of the organisation’s most ruthless killers.Jailed as a teenager after being found in possession of five bayonets in the 1960s long before Northern Ireland was consumed by sectarian violence, McCann quickly rose to become a senior IRA commander in Belfast.In this role, his unwavering support for the “armed struggle”, as he called it, saw him responsible for the murder of at least 10 British soldiers, as well as the attempted assassination of the Ulster Unionist politician John Taylor in February 1972.McCann’s insatiable appetite for acts of extreme violence led to him being top of the Royal Ulster Constabulary’s wanted list. Indeed, it has even been suggested that his violent conduct prompted more moderate figures in the IRA leadership to reveal his whereabouts in Belfast, resulting in his killing by British soldiers in April 1972.It is a supreme irony, therefore, that one of the IRA’s more renowned killers should now, nearly 50 years after he met his violent end, be feted as a cause celebre by the republicans, someone who, instead of being remembered for the catalogue of violence he wrought, is lauded as an innocent victim of British brutality.The fact that McCann is viewed in such terms is the by-product of both the republican movement’s success in being able to see dubious cases relating to the Troubles brought to court, and the failure of successive British governments to prevent them from doing so.There have been numerous pledges in Queen’s Speeches dating back a decade or more in which ministers have pledged to address the anomaly by which veterans who risked their lives in the service of their country during the Troubles find themselves liable to prosecution, while IRA terrorists responsible for some of the worst atrocities of the era have been granted immunity.The fundamental reason for this iniquitous state of affairs dates back to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, when Tony Blair, in his desperation to win republican support for the deal, in effect granted an amnesty to IRA terrorists, irrespective of the crimes they had committed. Mr Blair has subsequently argued that, without this concession, the deal would never have been struck.But it resulted in an estimated 200 “on-the-run” terrorists being sent letters providing assurances that they were no longer wanted by the police for their crimes. Among them was John Downey, who was accused of carrying out the 1982 Hyde Park bombing, which killed 11 soldiers.While legions of IRA terrorists have been granted immunity from prosecution, it is a disgrace that no provision has been made to give similar protection to British service personnel who served during the Troubles, even though prime ministers from David Cameron through to Boris Johnson have promised to do so.There is an expectation that a pledge to provide better protection to veterans will be contained in next week’s Queen’s Speech outlining the Government’s goals. The concern, though, is that, as with previous promises, no effective action will ultimately be forthcoming.The simple reason for the Government’s reluctance to act is that, by affording veterans the same immunity from prosecution as IRA terrorists, Downing Street risks alienating Sinn Fein, the current standard-bearers of the republican cause whose support is deemed essential to maintaining the peace in Northern Ireland.Consequently, while the British authorities are prevented from prosecuting those responsible for some of the worst atrocities during the Troubles, Sinn Fein and their allies in Northern Ireland can persist with their persecution of British veterans even when, as this week’s collapse of the trial of the two paratroopers accused of murdering McCann has graphically demonstrated, the evidence is deeply flawed.Even though legal experts had given explicit warnings that there were serious flaws in the prosecution case several years ago, Barra McGrory, Northern Ireland’s then director of public prosecutions, insisted on proceeding.Mr McGrory has previously represented Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and his colleague Martin McGuinness, who are both alleged to have enjoyed close ties with the IRA. This has led to accusations that the trial of the two paratroopers was politically motivated, rather than an exercise in seeking justice.Certainly, with prosecutors in Northern Ireland said to be looking at pressing charges in another 200 cases involving veterans of the Troubles, there is an urgent need for the Government to take action to prevent further gross miscarriages of justice, instead of constantly pandering to the whims of Sinn Fein and its IRA supporters.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish independence polls tracker 2021 referendum latest election","story":"Opinion polls conducted since the start of April show dwindling support for Scottish independence,  analysis shows. Over the past month, an average of the polls show that 46 per cent of Scots are against independence whilst 45 per cent are in favour. The most recent ten polls conducted widen that gap to 47 per cent opposed and 44 per cent in favour. The proportion of undecided voters has remained steady at around 9 per cent of the population.The results come as a significant change in people\u0027s views on independence. Since early-2020, support for Scottish independence had overtaken opposition, with the Yes vote securing a 8 per lead in average polling numbers in October last year. This resurgence in Scottish nationalism came as the devolved government took a markedly different approach to its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic from Westminster and Brexit. But in recent months, the success of the UK-government\u0027s vaccination rollout and splits within the Scottish nationalist movement appear to have dampened support for independence. Before the resurgence last year, polls has shown clear opposition to independence, even after the EU referendum which saw England and Wales vote in favour of Brexit, whilst Northern Ireland and Scotland voted to remain. In 2014 Scotland voted by a clear majority to stay in the UK, with 55.3 per cent of ballots cast against independence leaving and 44.7 per cent cast in favour, but the most recent polling average now shows the situation reversed. Despite the decline in support for Scottish independence, the Scottish National Party has sustained a considerable gap in the polls ahead of Thursday\u0027s Scottish Parliament elections. An average of the most recent polls show 48.5 per cent of Scots plan to vote for the SNP in their constituencies.This is ahead of the Conservative\u0027s 21.5 per cent, Labour\u0027s 20.3 per cent and the Liberal Democrat\u0027s 7.5 per cent . But similar to independence, the support for the SNP has decreased in the polls in recent months. In October last year, their polling numbers averaged at around 54 per cent. Labour have benefited most from this slump in the polls, having increased their polling numbers by 5 per cent over the period. Scottish voters will also vote for regional members of the Scottish Parliament with polls similarly showing a significant gap between the SNP and the second-place Conservatives. During the last election in 2016, the SNP fells two seats short of an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament. The fall in the polls could hamper hopes of claiming a majority in the elections which would have been used as justification for seeking a second referendum vote. In January, the SNP proposed an 11-point roadmap for holding a second referendum if they secure a majority in the Parliament. Since then, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been engaged in a bitter conflict with former SNP leader Alex Salmond over sexual harassment claims against the latter. Ms Sturgeon was cleared of breaking rules over her handling of the allegations but was heavily criticised by some members of the Scottish Parliament. In the aftermath, Mr Salmond went on to form his own independence party, Alba, which is also contesting in today\u0027s Scottish election.   More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"spacex lands mars rocket fifth attempt","story":"SpaceX managed to land its prototype Starship rocket at its Texas base without blowing it up on Wednesday, the first time it has succeeded in doing so in five attempts.The test flight represents a major win for the hard-charging company, which eventually wants to carry crew inside Starship for missions to Mars.Starship landing nominal! tweeted founder Elon Musk triumphantly, after the last four tries ended in big explosions.Nominal means normal in the context of spaceflight.The execution wasn\u0027t quite perfect, with a small fire engulfing the base of the 50 meter- (160 feet-) high rocket, dubbed SN15, shortly after landing.SpaceX webcaster John Insprucker explained this was not unusual with the methane fuel we\u0027re using, adding engineers were still working out design issues.The flames were quickly put out with water cannons, footage showed.Earlier, the rocket took off at around 5:25 pm local time (2225 GMT) from the Starbase in Boca Chica in southern Texas, reached an altitude of 10 kilometers (6 miles) and performed a series of maneuvers, including a horizontal descent called a belly flop.SpaceX was facing added pressure to succeed with Wednesday\u0027s flight after NASA last month announced a version of Starship will be used as a lunar lander when the space agency returns humans to the Moon.But the $2.9 billion contract is currently suspended after two rival companies, Jeff Bezos\u0027 Blue Origin and Dynetics, lodged a protest.Nevertheless, if the award is eventually confirmed, it will transform Starship from Musk\u0027s pet project to a major tax payer-funded venture, with all the scrutiny that entails.The first two flight tests of Starship, SN8 and SN9, both crash landed and exploded when they launched in December and February, respectively.The next, SN10, successfully landed then blew up a few minutes later on March 3.The video feed cut out during the test flight of the fourth, SN11, with Musk later confirming it too had exploded, this time in mid-flight.Eventually, SpaceX plans to combine the Starship spaceship with a Super Heavy rocket, creating a fully reusable system to explore deep into our solar system.This final version will stand 394 feet (120 meters) tall and will be able to carry 100 metric tonnes into Earth orbit - the most powerful launch vehicle ever developed.Musk wants to use this to help realize his goal of transforming humanity into a multiplanetary species with a colony on Mars.The planned lunar version of Starship would however serve a more modest goal - docking with a future lunar orbital station, collecting astronauts, then setting them down on the Moon.To get the astronauts to the lunar station in the first place, NASA has a more traditional plan in mind: using its own giant SLS rocket with a crew capsule called Orion affixed on top.But the SLS rocket has suffered severe delays and cost overruns, and observers have mused if Starship succeeds, it could one day make SLS obsolete.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"waiving covid vaccine patents may noble really best solution","story":"Leading health experts have conflicting views on whether it is the right move to strip pharmaceutical companies of the intellectual property rights on Covid-19 vaccines.While the World Health Organisation (WHO) welcomed the decision by the US on Wednesday to waive its IP rights - calling it a “watershed moment” - some scientists warn the move could backfire.Dr Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, has pushed back against the global calls, warning it may not be the best way to actually improve vaccine access.In an interview this week Dr Fauci, the head of the US’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he was “agnostic” about the idea of waiving rights as it may not be “the fastest and most efficient way” of getting shots in arms.“If you take too long, people are going to die,” he told the Financial Times. “There are other ways to ramp up vaccine production around the world.With Covax, the WHO-led vaccine-sharing programme, struggling to gain momentum because of vaccine shortages, pleas have been growing to do something about what rights groups term “vaccine apartheid”. Wealthy countries have secured more than half of nearly nine billion doses locked up in purchase agreements to date. Developing countries that are most in need, such as virus-beleaguered India, meanwhile, have struggled to get their share.The waiver, which would affect firms like Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson, would give other companies across the world access to the information needed to make their own vaccines and remove legal barriers stopping them from doing so.Advocates say this would enable more manufacturers across the globe to produce vaccines and help combat dwindling supply. “Surely in this once in a hundred years moment of crisis, we can find it within us to forget about profits and think about humanity,” Dr Ayoade Alakija, co-chair of the Africa Union Vaccine Delivery Alliance. “The argument has to be for these big pharma to release the formula so we can save lives across the world.” Anna Marriott, Oxfam’s Health Policy Manager, added: “The horrific situation in India is a warning to all of us that if we don’t move urgently to share the vaccine technology and scale up manufacturing so everyone, everywhere can have access to these lifesaving vaccines, we will never get the upper hand on Covid anywhere.”But while Dr Fauci said he supports efforts to boost vaccine supply, he warned that a waiver could potentially end in a protracted legal battle as it needs to be agreed by the World Trade Organisation.“Going back and forth, consuming time and lawyers in a legal argument about waivers - that is not the end game,” he said. “People are dying around the world and we have to get vaccines into their arms in the fastest and most efficient way possible.”While Biden\u0027s backing adds political impetus to get a deal done, other countries with big pharmaceuticals sectors, including Britain, Japan, Switzerland and in the European Union, are opposed to the waiver and have the ability to block the proposal.What this decision will do, if it goes forward, is benefit countries like China that are aggressively trying to obtain US technology to bolster their own domestic champions, Republican Senator Mike Crapo said in a statement.Pharmaceutical companies also strongly oppose any efforts to do away with intellectual property rights. Companies argue that without the money patents bring in there is little incentive for them to undertake the expensive task of developing and bringing drugs to market. “This decision will remove the incentives and rewards for the innovators on who our very lives depend,” Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said on Wednesday. “If rights can be \u0027waived\u0027 away, they aren’t really rights. This is the wrong decision.”Big companies also argue that they are already operating at full capacity and that they have already taught manufacturers in other countries how to make their vaccines. While this so-called “tech transfer” has worked well during the pandemic so far, it uses up considerable resources.Industry experts say companies may not be able to produce the drugs quickly even without patent protections, pointing to supply chain issues and the wider technological know-how that is not included with patents.Thomas Cueni, the head of the pharmaceutical lobby group IFPMA, said at a panel recently that making vaccines isn’t like following a Mary Berry recipe. It is a far more complex process - and even if you do follow it recipe it does not always go to plan. Following the US announcement the IFPMA aded that the waiver is a distraction from the real challenges in scaling up production and distribution of vaccines globally: namely elimination of trade barriers, addressing bottlenecks in supply chains and scarcity of raw materials and ingredients in the supply chain, and a willingness by rich countries to start sharing doses with poor countries.Meanwhile, countries like India, which is now battling the world’s worst outbreak of Covid and has only fully vaccinated two per cent of its 1.4 billion population, need help now. Even campaigners for the waiver admit that it will not mean vaccines will be available overnight. Dr Fauci suggested that companies in the West should instead be encouraged to increase production and export excess doses, and countries should also donate any surplus, as some, such as Norway and Sweden, have begun to do. Pfizer has shipped some 10 million doses to Mexico, while the White House has promised to export 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.Many suggested that regardless of the effectiveness, such a decision would send a powerful message from richer countries and pharmaceutical firms that they are willing to forgo some profit for the greater good.“Arguably the strongest argument for a temporary waiver is that patents were never designed for use during global emergencies such as wars or pandemics,” wrote Nature magazine in a recent editorial.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"find local election candidates your","story":"NewsLocal election  candidates in full: Who is standing in your area Millions of people across the country will head to the polls today, Thursday  May, to vote in ious local elections.

The Labour leader on Wednesday toured the country campaigning for “every last vote” in the swathe of “Super Thursday” council, mayoral and national contests. As voters go to the polls today, he sets out his five-point plan to put Labour firmly on the path back to power, promising “a brighter, better future for you, your family and your community”. Writing in the Mirror, he says: “I’m driven by a burning desire to make this country the best place to grow up in and the best place to grow old in, whoever you are and wherever you live.” But he insisted that rebuilding the party after its worst general election defeat in more than  years under Jeremy Corbyn would take time. Out on the campaign trail, he said: “We’ve got to rebuild into the next general election – that is the task at hand.” Polls suggest Labour could be hammered in the Hartlepool ­by-election as the post-Brexit sht continues and the Tories benefit from a “vaccine bounce”. A defeat there would be a blow to Mr Starmer in what is being seen as a test of Labour’s appeal to its heartlands just over a year after he pledged to rebuild the “red wall”. But one senior Labour source said: “This was always going to be tough. There is a realignment going on that can’t be stopped in a year – especially during the pandemic.” Voters will have their say on English councils, the Scottish and Welsh parliaments as well as picking who holds power in city halls and regional mayoralties across England. It is the largest set of contests outside of a general election after last year’s polls were delayed by Covid. Boris Johnson, who campaigned on a bike on the Stourbridge canal in the West Midlands, claimed the elections would be “very tough”, despite the party being expected to make gains. Labour is expected to perform strongly in mayoral votes, including a victory for Sadiq Khan in London.  “King of the North” Andy Burnham is likely to hold Greater Manchester while the party should keep ­Liverpool, Bristol and a swathe of town councils. It is also hoping to take the West of England mayoralty. Other targets are seats in ­councils across the South. But it will be tested in the West Midlands, where Labour ex-minister Liam Byrne is snapping at the heels of Tory mayor Andy Street. Some insiders believe Labour could lose overall control of Sunderland and Durham councils for the first time.

The Labour Left has its knives out for Mr Starmer in the event the party suffers heavy defeats as some MPs warned he should “consider his ­position” and stand asidehe fails to make progress in “red wall” areas. But former deputy leader Harriet Harman said he should not resign no matter how badly the party fares. She said: “He’s has been trying to get the party sorted out and back on track so that we can win the confidence of British people.” The party has been closing the gap in national polls with Tory “sleaze” rows beginning to bite.  In Wales, Labour is expected to remain the biggest party but fall short of an outright majority. And in Scotland, polls suggest it is too close to call whether the SNP will get an outright majority. If they do, First Minister Nicola ­Sturgeon has said it would give a mandate for another independence referendum. Mr Johnson dismissed another vote as “irresponsible” given the pandemic.  Labour could overtake the Tories in Scotland to become the second biggest party under Anas Sarwar. On Thursday, ex-PM Gordon Brown lent his support in Glasgow. Mr Starmer – seen campaigning in Pontefract with Yvette Cooper and West Yorkshire mayoral candidate Tracy Brabin – said he will be a leader who “carries the can”. He said: “This is but a step on the road to the next general election.

Ballots are cast across Britain on Thursday for a series of local, mayoral and Police and Crime Commissioner polls, while electors in Wales choose members of the Senedd and Scots send representatives to Holyrood. But a study for the Compassion in Politics campaign has found huge support for making it a criminal offence for politicians to fib to the public. Some % would back the introduction of a new law to make it a crime for politicians to deliberately lie.  Support for the move was weakest among Lib Dem supporters with % giving it their approval. Backing was highest among Labour voters, % of whom wanted new legislation creating the offence, while % of Tory voters were supportive. Just three per cent of , people quizzed online by Opinium between April  and  opposed the idea – the same proportion who believed politicians routinely tell the truth. One in four polled thought no politician is ever truthful. Compassion in Politics co-director Jenner Nadel said: “We simply cannot continue to have a situation in which Parliament operates independently of every other workplace or business in the country. “If a company sells you a product and lies about it, you have the right to gain compensation. “The same should be true in politics:a politician wilfully lies about their achievements, views, or actions they should face real consequences - t hat way we can start to put some trust back in our political system and build a politics of integrity, compassion, and respect.” Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru have drafted legislation making it an offence for politicians to lie, which the party plans to table in Parliament later this year. Under its proposal, which is unlikely to become law without Government support, offenders found guilty could face an unlimited fine or two-year jail terms. Plaidaposs Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said: “Accountability lies at the heart of democracy – it is the foundation of trust in Government.

Chris King, , of Doncaster, lost both hands, except his thumbs, in an accident at work involving a metal-pressing machine. But now five years after having a pioneering operation at Leeds General Infirmarycarried out by Professor Simon Kay, he can use a pair of hand shears and his lawn mower. Talking to the Mirror about the “incredible gt” he was given in July , he said of his donor: “Because he died I’m made better and that still cuts into me now and again. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section “I still say to the Prof : ‘Do you know his nails are growing ’ and he tells me ‘Look Chris, they’re your hands’. “But he just doesn’t understand, I love it. I said to him: ‘We’re off to Scarborough. I’m taking the lad with me! He’s coming with me’. “I don’t know his family but he comes with me and it sits lovely with me.”  Chris said he doesn’t know who his donor was but believes he died in an accident and says he has written a “tear stained” thank you letter to his family. He said his donation has made him whole again and told how before his op he would hide his arms behind his back during trips out. “I always thought people were looking at me and some people were,” he said.  “But now I leave them by my side. “And then there was the time my niece just slipped her hand into mine and we just walked down to the sea together. She didn’t get scared or anything.” Chris said he has had to shield for most of the pandemic but has been kept sane because he loves “pottering around” in his garden.  “I bought myself a pair of hand shears because I can now use my hands a bit more, so I can cut my hedge in the back garden. “That’s what I used to do, I’d finish work and tidy the garden up a bit. It really boosted me up getting back to the garden. “I could still do little bits but I can pull start the mower now,too. It’s quite a lot of pressure to pull the cord, but I do that.  “I have to sometimes have a five minute rest with the shears because of the impact.” He joked: “My hands are perfect now. I can’t make a fist, butI have to defend myself, I can still give someone a severe handbagging. “And I’ve played pool and had a go at the kiddies ten pin bowling. ”  But he says the most “pleasurable” thing he’s been able to do with his new hands is to cut into a steak. “I used to go out and I’d order the steak and I’d say ‘look at that lovely meal there’ and I’d pass my meal to Mandyand say ‘Right Mandy, can you destroy it’ and she’d cut it up with a kne and fork for me. “You take your hands for granted, you really do.

We will all be affected by grief at some point – something that has proved all too true for many people as a result of the pandemic. There is of course no “right” or “normal” way to grieve – everyone will experience their own emotional journey following a bereavement. We shouldn’t be putting pressure on ourselves to experience a certain sensation – like anger or acceptance – at a certain time, says Andy Langford, clinical director at Cruse Bereavement Care. Instead, we should be giving ourselves time and space.But it can be particularly hard when you live alone. The following advice from Co-op Funeralcare might help:Keep talking One thing that can give comfort is talking about your feelings with friends or family, so it’s important not to become isolated. Stay connected Use video and phone calls and social media to stay in touch. Arrange times to chat with people – having this in your diary can add something to look forward to and purpose to your day.  Stick to a routine As much as possible, try to get up at the same time each day, and prepare and eat meals when you normally would. If you can, get outside to exercise. Don’t be too ambitious Set yourself manageable tasks. Sometimes that will simply be getting out for a walk. Getting the balance right between being busy as a distraction and taking the time to focus on your grief is key.

A flotilla of French boats headed towards the Channel islandaposs port of St Helier at about am, with angry fishermen lighting flares and waving banners calling for fishing access to the waters. They were still gathered in the harbour at .am as the row over post-Brexit fishing rights between the UK and France escalated on Thursday. Two local boats were said to have joined the demonstration as police and islanders watched the maritime stand-off. The Royal Navyaposs HMS Severn and HMS Tamar, armed with machine guns and cannon, were positioned some distance away after being sent to the islandaposs main port to “monitor the situation” following mounting threats from Normandy trawlermen. Furious David Sellam, head of the joint Normandy-Brittany sea authority, was quoted by French media as saying that Jersey had been taken over by an extremist fringe, who wanted to profit from Brexit.He added: Weaposre ready for war. We can bring Jersey to its kneesnecessary.Are you affected by the demonstration  Let us know at webnews@mirror. The row began after the island implemented new requirements under the terms of the UK-EU trade deal for boats to submit evidence of their past fishing activities in order to receive a licence to carry on operating in Jersey waters. French fisherman claim their rights are unfairly restricted. Jersey’s External Affairs Minister, Ian Gorst, who was optimistic that a solution could be found, said he and the local environment minister will be meeting French fishermen on Thursday morning. Dimitri Rogoff, head of fisheries for the Normandy region, told AFP the French boats would not try to block St Helier and wouldto France in the afternoon. The Commodore Goodwill freight ferry was initially unable to leave the harbour due to the arrival of the French fisheren. Condor CEO Paul Luxon tweeted: Sadly she is trapped, we tried to bring her in earlier so in - discharge, load - out, and on her way, but in dialogue with Jersey Authorities ‘safety first’ of course.apos  However, the protest leader later instructed the vessels to let the ship leave, the Jersey Evening Post reported. Two local boats from Jersey joined the protest, the report added. French fishermen were chatting via radio whether to push the protest further, but the consensus was no and they agreed to turn around and give the ferry room to leave the port, tweeted Paris-based Al Jazeera producer Tristan Redman, who was covering the scene in Jersey. aposLike an invasionapos Jersey fisherman Josh Dearing described the scene at the port of St Helier on Thursday morning as “like an invasion”, with the French fleet mostly made up of “big French dredgers and trawlers” of  metres or more. Mr Dearing, , said: “There were probably about  boats. There were a few hand-held flares and smoke flares going off and apparently a few maybe bangers and stuff going off from the French.“It was quite a sight. It was impressive, I looked from the shore this morning and it was just like a sea of red lights and flares already going off at sea. It was like an invasion.” Originally from Kent, the owner of The Jersey Catch fishing company said the fleet was mostly made up of “big French dredgers and trawlers” of about  metres or more.  There had been rumblings about a planned protest a few days ago, Mr Dearing said, but added that he had not been sureit was “serious or empty threats”. He said: “The French being the French, they don’t mess around. They can blockade their own harbours – they wouldn’t think twice about coming and doing it to us.” He was “absolutely” pleased to hear on Wednesday night that Royal Navy vessels were being deployed to patrol the waters around Jersey. He said: “We’re completely unprotected in Jersey. We’ve got nothing except for a few police officers. We don’t have a police boat, we don’t have a navy boat, we don’t have anything to protect us. “The French can be hostile. All of our livelihoods are in that harbour andthey wanted to they could cause damage.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

Mr Dearing, who said his fishing licence costs about £,, said French fishermen who have not been granted a licence to fish had “thrown their toys out of the pram”. He said: “Jersey fisheries has done nothing wrong. They’ve issued the permits to the French fisherman that were entitled to them and the ones that aren’t entitled don’t get the permits and that’s just le, that’s how it is. “The guys that have historical rights [to fish] have been granted them, as they should’ve done, and the ones that haven’t have just thrown their toys out of the pram.” Paris threatens to cut power Paris has warned it could cut off power to the island, which receives  per cent of its electricity from France through three undersea cables, in retaliation for the fallout. Franceaposs threats to cut off Jerseyaposs electricity were clearly unacceptable and disproportionate, the UK Government said. French fishermen launched their protest a day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Jersey Chief Minister Senator John Le Fondre and Mr Gorst they have his unwavering support. French maritime minister Annick Girardin warned on Tuesday that the country was ready to take retaliatory measures, accusing Jersey of dragging its feet over issuing new licences to French boats. Mr Gorst and the local environment minister were due to hold talks with the French fishermen on Thursday. He told BBC News: “He and I will, as I say, later this morning be going out to listen to the French fishermen. “It’s really important that we are able to work with those fishermen to help them provide the necessary evidence so that,required, their licences can be amended. “As I’ve said, it’s important that we respond to threats, but the answer to this solution is to continue to talk and diplomacy.” Mr Gorst said the demonstration had been peaceful, “which is what we would have expected”. UK aposmust respond firmlyapos to threats He said it is “important” that the Government responds “firmly” to “threats”. On Wednesday Mr Gorst held talks with Marc Lefevre, the president of the La Manche region of northern France, on the dficult set of issues relating to fishing licences. As the protest continued on Thursday, he said: “We’ve heard disproportionate threats from Paris and now with a potential blockade, but the answer to the issues that are being faced are without doubt talking and diplomacy.” Askedit was disproportionate to send Royal Navy vessels to patrol the waters around Jersey, he said: “A minister in Paris threatened over technical issues on fishing licences to cut off Jersey’s electricity. “We have to take such threats seriously and respond appropriately. “And fishing vessels threatened to blockade the main harbour into the island. “Again, we have to take that seriously and we’re extremely grateful to the Prime Minister for his full support and, as he said last night, those assets in Jersey waters are as a precautionary measure to monitor what’s happening in our waters and, as I’ve said, so far the protest has been peaceful, as we would expect.” Stephanie Yon-Courtin, a French MEP and member of the EU Fisheries Committee, called on Jersey residents and the UK Government to “understand that our fishermen need to carry on working”. “This situation is all the more sad because historically Jersey and the French fisherman have always had very cordial and pretty good relations for the past decade,” she told BBC Radio ’s Today programme. “Some of Jersey’s people need to understand, and Jersey’s government and UK Government, have to to understand that our fishermen need to carry on working. Askedshe supported the threat that power could be cut off to Jersey in the future, she added: “I’m just saying that at the last resort,we don’t have any other means to be understood, then we will have to consider that. “We don’t want to do that, I don’t think it’s good, I don’t think it’s good for anybody.”  Royal Navy crew on board HMS Severn, previously used to shadow Russian navy warships off the English coast, and HMS Tamar watched Thursdayaposs demonstration from a considerable distance. The ships are used for fisheries protection and sailors are allowed to board other vessels for spot checks. At one point, it appeared a French naval vessel, called Athos, was heading towards Jersey. However, it turned around and ed to the naval base in Cherbourg-en-Cotentinaposs harbour. A UK Ministry of Defence spokesman said: HMS Severn and HMS Tamar are deploying to Jersey to conduct maritime security patrols. This is a strictly precautionary measure and has been agreed with the Jersey Government. A Downing Street spokesman added: The Prime Minister and Chief Minister stressed the urgent need for a de-escalation in tensions and for dialogue between Jersey and France on fishing access. The Prime Minister underlined his unwavering support for Jersey. He said that any blockade would be completely unjustied.  As a precautionary measure the UK will be sending two offshore patrol vessels to monitor the situation. They agreed the UK and Jersey Governments would continue to work closely on this issue. John Healey MP, Labour’s shadow defence secretary, said the threats on Jersey are completely unreasonable, as he urged the Government to meet with their French counterparts and the islandaposs authorities. He added: The Navy’s experience in sensitive situations will help reassure residents and protect Britain’s broader national interests. “The British Government must now get round the table with French colleagues and authorities in Jersey and sort this issue out.” Don Thompson, president of Jersey Fishermen’s Association, said the “big question on everybody’s lips right now is whether the UK Government would give in to the tactics of the French.  He told Good Morning Britain: “The French fishermen out there want conditions removed from their licences so that they can fish with no constraints in our waters, whilst our boats are subject to all sorts of conditions about how much they can catch, where they can go.” He said it would be “grossly unfair”the Government does “capitulate to that” and said such tactics might be used “again and again in the future”. He added: “They’re not very happy fishermen down here this morning, suspecting that we probably will see our Government give in to that.” Mr Thompson said Jersey’s fishermen had told the Government they are prepared to ditch their fishing licencesthe French win their demands. He added: “We’ve already told our minister – our licences, some of our fishermen have paid a quarter of a million pounds for our licences – we’re going to get rid of our licences and fish without licences.

The reasons could often be described as trivial. A spat over a jacket , a smashed-up guitar . But there’s nothing trivial about singer Jesy Nelson’s decision to quit Little Mix. The star announced she was leaving the chart-topping band last December. When she pulled out of their BBC talent show The Search citing medical reasons I knew the writing was on the wall. This week she announced the reason for her decision. In an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine she revealed her departure was due to her struggles with weight. Like many of us, she says she’d gained weight during lockdown. She then went on an extreme diet to get in shape for a music video. It left her thoroughly miserable and on the day of the shoot she had a panic attack. Thankfully, someone took her aside and basically said what she was going through – the dieting, trying to change her body shape and being left unhappy and in tears – simply wasn’t worth it. It was a turning point and with courage she walked away. I really applaud her for taking that step and I applaud the person who told her “you can’t keep doing this to yourself”. When I covered showbiz, it was unusual for people in the music industry to put the wellbeing and feelings of the artist first. Too often people stay in unhappy situations, be it their professional or personal lives, for all the wrong reasons. I know I certainly have.

Matthew Simpson, , says that Covid- has meant he has been unable to sign up to a surgery in Hull, West Yorkshire. This is despite having chipped teeth, a missing filling - and even yanking out his own molar when he got particularly desperate.Matthew, a full-time carer for his we, told HullLive he has struggled through two lockdowns as he has been unable to get an NHS date.This has left him having to learn the safest way to eat - with it claimed he might not be seen by a dentist until October.Have you had to resort to emergency self-dentistry  Let us know, email webnews@mirrorHe acknowledges he could go private - but said he refuses to pay more out of principle. Matthew said: Once we hit lockdown the dentist wouldn’t touch anybody. When we unlocked I tried again but they were still saying the same thing that they weren’t taking on any NHS patients. I tried again this week since more restrictions were lted and with more shops opening and people going out, I thought I might have a chance but I keep on getting told the same things. I could afford to go and get a dentist but it is out of principle, why should I go and pay £ for a dentist plus more treatment on top of that. It is going to cost hundreds of pounds to get my teeth sorted out but I shouldn’t have to pay - they should be taking on National Health Service patients.  What is the dference between taking on a National Health Service patient and a private one  “If they can fit you in within in a weekyour willing to pay - why can’t they fit you in for an NHS appointment  Mr Simpson fears that waiting until September to register will delay his treatment further, concerned that many others will have been told the same thing and overload the system when the dentists are able to take on new patients. It could even be next year because you know what’s going to happen - everyone is going to start ringing upthey are telling that to every person that rings, he said. I donapost mind waiting a month or two for my treatment but I think it’s ridiculous that it is September, October time before you sign up.“I don’t understand, I have noticed that dentists and doctors are all using this Covid as an excuse.You can’t get in to see a doctor, you get fobbed off. You can’t get in to see a dentist – they are using Covid as an excuse and to me it’s just an excuse.  Things are getting back to normal now the numbers are coming down in Hull – I don’t understand why they can’t start taking on NHS patients. It is just general wear and tear and because I am diabetic type  you can have problems with your teeth. I couldn’t be bothered ringing around for a dentist with the NHS - my tooth was that loose and that cracked. When I was going into town I felt half the tooth come out in my mouth then when I came back it was a bit loose so I just got a pair of pliers, closed my eyes and just yanked it and it just came straight out. It was over within seconds, I didn’t feel any pain. I still have half a tooth there that needs removing and then there’s a filling next to it which has fallen out. It happened about three weeks ago actually, I felt a bit of tooth come out of my mouth and I didn’t realise until I swallowed it and then when I looked there was a big gap between two of my teeth on the upper right hand side.

I’m in a little pain where my little chipped tooth is,I eat on that side it irritates the gum so I try not to eat on that side but then I’ve got big holes on the other side so it is a no win situation at the moment. This is why I am trying to get into the dentist to get all this repaired but all they are doing is dragging it out - by the time I do go in there is going to be months of work to be done on my teeth. I have started to learn where about to eat my food sothere is anything hard I have to eat in the centre of my mouth butit is something soft then I can eat it on my left hand side with no problems. I can’t eat anything hard on the left hand side because I am worried it is going to break the half a tooth that is there. I have had to learn in the past  months the safest way to eat which I shouldn’t have to. A spokesperson for NHS England said: As a result of safety measures put in place to provide treatment in a Covid-safe way, regular and routine dentistry remains limited compared to levels of provision prior to the coronavirus pandemic.Progression to resume the full range of routine dental care is taking time and practices continue to prioritise seeing patients who have an urgent dental treatment need.

The Duchess of Sussex yesterday announced she has written a childrenaposs book about the relationship between a dad and a son which will be published next month. The book, titled aposThe Benchapos, features an illustration of a soldier, with ginger hair, who holds his little boy. Royal author Phil Dampier has claimed that with her new book Meghan wants to show that her husband is upset after losing his military titles - which were removed after the Sussexes stepped down as senior members of the Royal Family.  Mr Dampier told The Sun : Meghan is probably showing how much the Army meant to Harry and how upset he is to lose his military titles.For Harry, who put his le on the line and then founded the highly successful Invictus Games for injured servicemen and women, losing the titles was the bitterest part of ‘Megxit.’ Meghanaposs book focuses on the special relationship between a dad and a son as seen through the mumaposs eyes, publisher Random House said on Tuesday.  The Bench started as a poem I wrote for my husband on Fatheraposs Day, the month after Archie was born,aposapos Meghan said in a statement. That poem became this story. Meghan said: My hope is that The Bench resonates with every family, no matter the makeup, as much as it does with mine.”  The bookaposs cover features her royal title, the Duchess of Sussex. The picture book, published by Random House Childrenaposs Books, has been illustrated by award winning artist Christian Robinson, and the audiobook is narrated by Meghan. A press release describes the book as a “touchingly captures the evolving and expanding relationship between fathers and sons and reminds us of the many ways that love can take shape and be expressed in a modern family”.

Landlord Jonathan Armstrong claimed he had no choice but to take action, after the rude and obnoxious behaviour of younger drinkers. They were putting regular customers off by flouting social distancing rules at the Old Neighbourhood drinking venue since it’s reopening, Mr Armstrong explained, causing people in the local area to stop visiting. The pub, based in Chalford Hill, Stroud, was among those with beer gardens allowed to reopen and let customers drink outside after lockdown restrictions were eased. But Mr Armstrong said it had been an uphill battle from then on, trying to stop younger drinkers from table-hopping, ignoring social distancing rules and annoying neighbours. Regular customers had also stopped visiting the pub because they felt intimidated by the bad language, shouting and loud behaviour from customers under . Staff were constantly having to tell them to sit down, to stop hopping tables and to follow the guidelines,” he said. “You have to fight them about it and then they just start getting rude and obnoxious. We constantly have to apologise to neighbours because theyaposre making such a noise. Itaposs just not what we are about. Itaposs a shame, it really is. Weaposre really upset about it because itaposs something weaposre not used to and I think itaposs unnecessary.  He has even employed a doorman to try to help keep order at the pub. Itaposs unfortunate because there are youngsters who are really well behaved and I hate painting people with the same brush. With people under the age of  taking up all of the  outside seats on some evenings, Mr Armstrong said he thought the bad behaviour might have been caused by lockdown and fewer pubs in general being open. I think whataposs happened is that a lot of the pubs have closed because they havenapost got outside gardens, so anyone with a garden is attracting all these other people. I often wonderitaposs maybe because theyaposve come of age during lockdown and they havenapost been to a pub before. Iaposm not sure, they just donapost seem to know how to behave.

Laura Clarke took an image of a woman with a middle parting and a sweeping curtain fringe to her appointment for her hairdresser to recreate, but what she gave her was quite the opposite...In a TikTok video that has been viewed almost three million times, Laura revealed the blunt, block haircut sheaposd been left with.She said: Went to the hairdressers today to get a middle part and curtain bangs. This was the photo I showed them. The clip then cut to a very unimpressed Laura showing off the hairstyle sheaposd been given. Since being posted, the video has racked up more than , likes and , comments from viewers who were convinced sheaposd cut her hair herself because it looked so bad. Whilst a few people said she just needed to style the fringe properly, others said the hairdresser had botched it up.  One person said: I have this hair cut and I donapost style it. Stop saying itaposs all about styling. The hairdresser screwed this up big time. Another said: Hairdressers lives will be much easier when people realise the hair in these photos has all been styled.

It came from nothing, just a little clip pass out wide.“I’d never had an injury like this before and, at the time, it didn’t feel too bad.“I wasn’t sure what I had done. It felt almost like a cramp but I thought I was fitter than that!“It was only when we scanned it a few days later and found out how bad it was. Finding out I needed surgery was a shock.“It was only when I woke up from the surgery that it all hit me, how serious it was.“But I feel a lot stronger now and I just want to get back out there.”Almost four-and-a-half months passed between his injury in the Highlands to a substitute appearance in the - win over Raith Rovers.During that time Dundee have gone from revival to no hopers and then back to revival in their quest toto the Premiership.Now, though, they have found their groove and powered up the table to finish second after eight matches unbeaten.Jakubiak may only have been able to feature in four minutes of that run – and is critical of his own showing that day, too – but is delighted to be ing to fitness with Dundee in good fettle.mdash Alex JakubiakApril , He even credits the confidence around the camp as reason for making him work even harder to get back in.The Dark Blues are now four matches away from their goal of top-flight football.They await the winner of the Raith-Dunfermline play-off quarter-final this week.And Jakubiak says there will be no letting up from the Dark Blues, eventhey have a week off ahead of the semi-final.He added: “I was speaking to some of the lads and they said they couldn’t believe how quickly the season had gone but for me it’s the complete opposite.“Just being in the gym working, watching the games and seeing the guys train, as frustrating as it is, has helped me come through stronger.“I’ve got a more positive mindset coming back to training and the way the guys have been, it’s made me work that bit harder to get up to the fitness levels needed to match the rest of the lads.“It’s been a tough season physically but mentally as well. I do feel I’ve come out of what you might say is a dark place but can now see the light at the end of the tunnel.“The mood around the club has been very positive. We know the situation we’re in.#All season we’ve been going into games believing we can win because we are a big club and need to have that mindset.“We feel we shouldn’t be in this league but that’s the situation we find ourselves in.#Now we have got into this situation we don’t want to waste all the hard work we have put in till now.“So we’re going to push even harder from now till the end of the play-offs.”Jakubiak is pushing for ato action before the end of the season but knows how much is on the line for the Dark Blues.With that in mind, he’s aware game time will not come easily with promotion at stake.But he’ll do his part when called upon.“I’ve been desperate to get back out there from day one in the gym!” he added.“That’s my mindset, I’m just eager to play and show what I can do. It’s been tough and frustrating recently not being able to play.“It was good to get a few minutes at the end of the Raith game, it felt good.#Although I am very self-critical and I know their goal was partly my fault.#Even that, regardless of my injury, I know there are parts of my game I can work on and improve on. That will only come with playing games.“I will keep working hard and I will hopefully get a chance in these games.“It will be tough, though, because the lads have been doing so well.“The performance on Friday night at Queens was pretty comfortable. We were good all over the pitch, solid at the back and Jason got his two goals. He’s in great form.“It will be tough to get into the team but all I can do is keep working.“As much as I want to play every minute, the only thing that matters is we win the ties. Our ultimate goal is promotion.“So whichever team the manager picks, he has a lot of fit, strong, lads who are ready to go. Whoever he picks will do a good job.# Shaun Byrne is determined to relive the best moment of his career by helping Dundee to promotion # and he says the Dark Blues are a better side than his Livingston play-off winners\" title\"#Shaun Byrne is determined to relive the best moment of his career by helping Dundee to promotion #

and then some.Ten-time Scottish Cup winners # all before  # Scotland#s oldest club will find themselves in League One next season and, hopefully, playing at a redeveloped Lesser Hampden as a club resurgent in the professional game.For Dundee United defender Liam Smith, however, his experience of playing Queen#s Park is as an amateur outfit steeped in tradition.In a loan spell at East Fe in  , while on the books at Hearts, the right-back played against the Glasgow side in front of  or so fans at Hampden and was on the losing end both times.No doubt, it was an eerie experience for a young kid but one Smith, now , feels will stand him in good stead for United#s Scottish Cup semi-final against Hibs at a near-empty national stadium on Saturday.He said: “I never played at Hampden with Hearts# first team but I played there for East Fe against Queens Park!“It will be similar this time because it was empty so I know what that’s like.“I’m looking forward to it but just gutted it won’t be full because I’m sure both sets of supporters would’ve brought a great support.“Having seen what it means to the United fans from their send off for the quarters # and they’ve sold loads of season tickets # we know the support is there going into it.“Nobody needs to tell us how big a game it is and we’re all looking forward to it.”Although they are yet to get one over the Hibees since theirto the Premiership this season, Smith believes the Tangerines have as good a chance as anyone of going all the way.Smith, who captained the Jambos in a  Youth Cup Final loss to Motherwell at the national stadium, is hopeful for a positive result against his old Edinburgh rivals to set up a showpiece against St Johnstone or St Mirren.“I don’t think form, particularly, comes into it and they got beat on Saturday as well ,# the Fer added.“It’s just  minutes, two teams and the previous games against them don’t count for much.“It’s a one-off, the occasion takes care of itself.“We’ve done our research on them, we’ve played them a few times already as well so we know about them.“We’re building up to the game seeking a positive result.“It’s anybody’s cup now isn’t it “The Old Firm are always favourites but when they go out and it’s down to four teams everyone thinks: ‘What a chance we’ve got’.“I’m sure all the teams will be thinking that but, equally,we can put in a performance like we did against Aberdeen then why can it not be us ”Last weekend#s - Premiership defeat to Ross County at Tannadice wasn#t the ideal way for the Terrors to warm-up for Saturday#s massive clash # a repeat of the  semi.Although he is convinced the United squad weren#t distracted by the Hibs match as they failed to replicate their performance in a - quarter-final win over Aberdeen, Smith says they have to put the County disappointment behind them.“I don’t think so but you know it’s there because it’s a massive game.# he said when askedthey had one eye on the semi-final.“I think you’ve got to be professional and take one game at a time so there was no speaking about it through the week.Dundee United analysis: Ross County get it right against road-weary Tangerines unable to stop eyes wandering towards Hampden humdinger\" title\"#Dundee United analysis: Ross County get it right against road-weary Tangerines unable to stop eyes wandering towards Hampden humdinger# #

The former Dunfermline and Raith Rovers talisman has scored four goals in his last seven club games and was selected in Clarke’s last squad to face Austria, Israel and Faroe Islands last month.He made his international debut, coming on as a th-minute substitute in a - triumph over the Faroes.The news of his omission in favour of Nisbet would have undoubtedly landed like a tonne of bricks on Shankland, who had become a well-kent face in the Scotland set-up.He has only made four appearances, but has been a steady pick since his maiden call-up in October  always relied upon to graft, press and, when needed, convert a crucial penalty, as he did in last year’s Euro  playoff semi-final win over Israel.However, Shankland has only scored eight times this seasoncompared to Nisbet’s tally of . If it comes down to a straight shoot-out, there will only be one winner.The question is: will it  Or will Clarke take into account the areas in which Shankland has continued to thrive, even as the goals dried up.So often seen as a one-dimensional goal-getter in his youth, Shankland’s game has undoubtedly developed during United’s campaign in the top-flight. He has illustrated versatility and a fine work ethic in Micky Mellon’s demanding --.‘Defend from the front,’ is the oft-repeated mantra and heat maps from Shankland#s last six starts in the Premiership — provided by Opta Sports — underline his willingness to work across the midfield line and defend deep on the flanks.Nisbet, by contrast, is afforded the chance to do the majority of his work in central areas. The -year-old will occasionally drop deep to collect possession, hold the ball up and find a teammate, but will then dash for the box.His movements into wide areas are sparse and rarely go beyond a foray to the left channel. However, the wing is the domain of the excellent Josh Doig.The vast dference in amount of time both players actually spend in central areas due to the dferent shapes and priorities of United and Hibs make it unfair to compare the players solely on goals.If Clarke is looking for a player to throw on in desperate search of a late goal a predatory front-man whose instincts have been sharpened following a season of playing as an out-and-out ’No.’, then Nisbet is the safer bet.If he intends to select a player who has proved adept at contributing to the game, whether in or out of possession, then Shankland is back in the game — as statistics from both players’ last  Premiership starts illustrate.Shankland may not ripple the net with the same regularity as Nisbet, but he affects the game more, has more touches, makes more passes and creates chances for others at a higher rate.UEFA’s decision to allow national teams to select three extra bodies —  instead of the usual  — has created a fascinating new dynamic, as has the unfortunate injury to Oli McBurnie.Ché Adams, of course, is a certainty.Is Leigh Grfiths a wildcard that Clarke will be tempted to include And, depending on where he lands on his other attacking dilemmas, will he go for the arch goal-getter, Nisbet, or the versatile grafter, Shankland.One suspects Clarke’s mind is not quite made up — and a standout performance at Hampden on Saturday could quite literally be a game-changer for either man.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/GJEN4122_38857086-558x372.jpg ","title":"this is a big moment for scotland polling stations welcome voters across tayside and fife","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remAs Scotland went to the ballot boxes this morning, polling stations in Dundee were expected to be quieter than normal after a surge in postal votes.It is understood around % of voters in the city had already cast their ballots by post.There was only a trickle of people arriving at Craigiebank Church to vote after the polls opened at am.SNP councillor and Dundee City Council#s finance spokesman, Willie Sawers, was in attendance and said: #I have already cast my own vote by post along with around % of the people of Dundee.#This will inevitably lead to the ballot boxes in Dundee being quieter than normal.#Gregg Duncan, , was also at Craigiebank and said: #I think this is a big moment for Scotland.#Along at Forthill Primary School, Broughty Ferry, Alexander Smith, , said: #I#m here early to vote before I go to work.#It#s important that people vote #

bank has spoken of her disappointment after all the cash was taken and the shelves cleared out overnight.The Torry Community Larder on Wood Street is run by local residents and began operating at the beginning of the pandemic.It is regularly used by anyone in the area experiencing food poverty and has been a leline for some during this dficult year.But its shelves were left almost bare on Sunday morning after someone visited the larder during the night and cleared it out # leaving only some nappies and rice.“I check on it every day and on Sunday I saw that it had been totally cleaned out,” said resident Jayne Carmichael Norrie, who set up the larder last year.“The night before there were at least eight bags of dried pasta there and seven tins of veg and lots of other bits.“But the only thing that was left was a few nappies and a bag of brown rice, everything  was completely gone.“I leave a little tin of spare change in the larder too in case folk need to buy some fresh milk or something, but someone had taken the whole tin.“Not just the money, but the tin too. And I thought, ‘are you kidding me ’ it’s a bit ridiculous.“Obviously I don’t want to judge anybody for taking eight bags of pasta, maybe you are feeding an army, but I’m just a bit sceptical that someone needed all that.”This is the first time the community larder has been abused in this way since it was set up last year.However, after posting an appeal on Facebook, the shelves were fully stocked again within an hour with donations from other kind-hearted Torry residents.When lockdown began back in March , Jayne was concerned that residents in Torry might struggle to get enough food to feed their families, and so decided to set up a small food bank on her street.“A lot of folk do sht work and that kind of thing and I knew that lots of people had been made redundant or put on furlough,” she said.“I’d also heard that some of the normal foodbanks couldn’t open anymore because people weren’t allowed to be inside buildings together, so the normal ways people might get support weren’t open to them anymore.“I thought wellyou’re really stuck, there’s not a lot of choices for people.”She dug out an old set of shelves from the back of her shed and placed them on the street in front of her house, then went to Aldi and picked up a few basic items and put them out.Later Jayne posted a message on a Torry community page on Facebook, letting residents know that the service was therethey needed it.“I thought it would just be me and my husband who would maintain it, so I was really surprised at the response from others,” Jayne said.“People chat to me all the time and say they always keep an eye on the shelves to seeit’s running low.“It tends to get used a lot more at the end of the month.“I guess as people are waiting for pay day they are needing a little bit of extra help.“This first time I’ve been a bit down about it and thought someone was just taking advantage.”After discovering the empty shelves, Jayne posted a message to Facebook askinganyone had any spare food they could donate.Within the hour there was food on the shelves again and residents were as disappointed as Jayne to see the larder abused.One social media user said: “Shame when you get real genuine people needing a small bit of help.#Another wrote: “There seems to be a group of people in Torry that are spoiling things for others, damaging cars, giving folk verbal abuse, frightening people and stone throwing to name a few things. Come on parents, get the kids to respect others please.”The news of the ransacked larder comes as bus operators Stagecoach confirm they have pulled evening services in Torry after stones were thrown at buses driving through the area at night.It is understood that the incidents have involved windows being smashed.Councillor for Torry and Ferryhill, Audrey Nicoll, said: #The community larder has supported people in Torry for a long time thanks to local folks making sure it is always well stocked.“While this incident is really disappointing, the speed with which the larder was replenished

accelerate Aberdeen#s masterplan projects in an effort to turbo-charge the city’s economic recovery in the wake of the Covid- pandemic.Earlier this year Aberdeen City Council approved £ million of spending as part of a review of the city centre masterplan.The plans include a major revamp of the area around the beach, as well as key city centre sites, including the Bon Accord shopping centre and Norco House, occupied by John Lewis, which announced its intention to close in March.Now members of the local authority’s city growth and resources committee are being asked to approve the objectives of the revised plan and “accelerate” the restart of masterplan projects which are already underway.Elite cycling event the Tour of Britain will visit Aberdeen in .Councillors will also be asked to move ahead with those projects which are due to begin in the coming months to assist the city#s recovery.These include the development of a plan focusing on the beach and the surrounding area, the implementation of electric vehicle infrastructure and a review of which Spaces for People interventions should be retained in the aftermath of the Covid- pandemic.Earlier this week we also revealed ambitious plans to transform the former BHS building in the city, with proposals to turn it into a new market.A report to the committee by the council’s director of resources Steven Whyte reads: “Economic shocks tend to accelerate structural changes.“The high street and retail pre-Covid- were continuing to adapt to the structural change brought about by online shopping.“Pre-Covid, we witnessed the demise of BHS which occupied a prime site on Union Market Street. The pandemic has exacerbated the pace and scale of the decline of high street retail, with recent closure announcements by Debenhams and John Lewis.”The review of the masterplan will also see councillors decide on the long-term objectives for the document – including those more than five years in the future.A “green recovery” is key for the future development of the city, according to Mr Whyte’s report, while increased use of open spaces such as parks and the beach is expected to continue.Major works to revamp Union Terrace Gardens are already being carried out.And the regeneration of the beach area could include improved active travel links, as well as a new stadium for Aberdeen FC.Mr Whyte’s report adds: “Green and open spaces have been a haven for everyone during the lockdown whether that be the formal parks across the city, the coastal walks or within the neighbourhoods we live. And for many, these spaces have been discovered and enjoyed for the first time.“Within the city centre, Union Terrace Gardens are a signicant green and open space and their re-opening is very timely.“We should also consider the other green and open spaces within the CCMP boundary and the impact of maximising these from any existing parking provision.“The beach area has been the focus of leisure and active travel activity throughout lockdown, emphasising its importance to the city.“We need to understand the future requirements in this area, again on a short, medium and long-term basis.”Councillors will discuss the revised masterplan when the city growth and resources committee meets next Tuesday.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.59080986-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.59080986-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.59080986-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.59080986-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"woman denies breaching covid rules by allowing patrons inside aberdeen pub to drink","story":"A woman has denied breaching coronavirus regulations by allowing patrons inside Victoria Bar to drink alcohol in October last year.

It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

Hopefully with all of that we see light at the end of the tunnel for fans getting back next season.”On the encouraging start to season ticket sales the chairman added: “The response has been fantastic. After a few days as of last night we had sold , season tickets already and .% of those are new season ticket holders which is important as well as we drive forward with the aspiration of getting , season ticket holders.“If you help us get to , season tickets this year each season ticket holder will get five percent cashback to spend at the club. If we get , each season ticket holder will get % so it’s not to be snfed at.“I believe it is doable with the fan engagement Rob and the guys are putting in place and we have a strategy on the field for playing attacking and entertaining football.“We want to reward fans who cajole a family member or friend into giving us a chance to entertain them.” While Wicks oversees improvements off the field at Pittodrie Cormack is focused with manager Stephen Glass on bringing improvements on the pitch and expects to be busy supporting the new boss’ recruitment efforts in the weeks ahead.He said: “After bringing in Stephen Glass and Allan Russell # and with Scott Brown to join them – it was important we give them a period of time with the existing squad. They’ve only had a short period of time with the guys“We outlined a clear strategy for the club. How we greet fans here, how the food is considered is important. But on the field that attacking entertaining style of play is important. When I look back on my time when Aberdeen have been successful it has been down to a combination of an entertaining style of play, experienced professionals and young players coming through.“In the last few weeks Paul Sheerin and Stephen have given young players full debuts, not a cameo at the end of the game. That in itself is encouraging.“There are a number of players out of contract and Stephen will wait until these last two games. We’ve also talked about potential targets and you will see some announcements that Stephen and his team will make on players coming in for next season.“It’s an exciting time and everybody can’t wait to get back and experience the club. I’m realistic but optimistic about next season. This is not like a few years ago. Next season is going to be the most competitive in some time which is healthy for the league but also we need to be ready for that and I think we will be.”Cormack and Wicks also confirmed the club’s new kits for next season will be unveiled later than normal. The home kit should be launched next month or early July with the away kit following in August.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of .  The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we’re delighted this funding means they can continue. Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"argyll gardens bloom for 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It was not the practice to make public the particulars in cases where those responsible for criminal investigation were satisfied that no crime had been committed but he might mention, for the satisfaction of the honourable member and those on whose behalf the question was put, that on recovery of the body what was observed tended strongly to confirm the accuracy of the statements which had been made at the time by those who were with the deceased when the accident took place.#PICS:Alexander McNab, born Argyll in , at two stages in le. no_aMcNab_story_AlexClare#s great grandmother, Grace McNab Bridge, as a young woman in the early th century. no_aMcNab_story_GraceGrace in later years. no_aMcNab_story_GraceClare Frith has been researching her family history. no_aMcNab_story_ClarePrivate Andrew McNab, one of three McNab brothers killed during the First World War. no_aMcNab_story_Andrew"},{"url":null,"title":"shorter racing only scottish series planned","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Each route takes visitors on a real pilgrimage to ancient Christian landmarks, through remote and impressive landscapes.#Whilst Faith in Cowal is a Christian organisation, the routes are open to people of all faiths and none and provide the perfect way to connect with the wild beauty Cowal has to offer. Some of the sites that book-end each trail date as far back as the th and th centuries as well as more ancient landmarks such as Auchnaha Cairn that are thought to be Neolithic in origin.#The walks take in locations close to the major settlements and population centres of Cowal including Strachur, Dunoon, Kilfinan and Colintraive but they#re unlike any other path you#ll find. These are not all neatly manicured and waymarked trails. We have deliberately kept them dynamic and wild by making use of forestry roads and ancient heritage paths. Many of the routes require short, improvised hikes between paths so you#ll feel like a real pilgrim forging your way through the landscape.#There are detailed guides on our website as well as downloadable GPS tracks. We hope as many visitors to Cowal as possible will take this opportunity to step in the footsteps of ancient pilgrims and travellers, enjoy the wonderful scenery of Argyll and explore fascinating sites of genuine spiritual and religious importance,# added Dan.PICS:A map of the routes. no_aFootstepsFaithPhotos: subtlesensorHistoric Kilmun church, on the shores of the Holy Loch. no_aFootstepsFaith_©subtlesensor_Kilmorich graveyard, Cairndow. no_aFootstepsFaith_KilmorichGraveyard©subtlesensor"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

One of the highlights from last year’s event included celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by the lockdown for just over a year.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS. This will only be possible when Scotland is independent once more.Susan Swain, Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"self help bike workshop opens in tayvallich","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Our pretty Highlander girls have lost all interest in us now that the grass and rashes are a vivid, succulent green. They graze far and wide, ignoring their hay ring breakfast bar where they jostled and queued all winter.The sheep roam around the cattle’s hairy feet, no longer mooching for scraps from their breakfast table. So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond. Thanks to those techie neighbours who set up email networks and social media groups there is a fantastic bank of information and expertise shared locally.Whether you want to learn how to plant oak trees, acquire foraging skills or find out how to run your home on renewable energy, somebody local has been there, done it and is happy to point you in the right direction.Over the last few months this valuable mine of knowledge and enthusiasm for environmental projects has been formalised into the Tayvallich Sustainability Plan, a  for sharing information and taking action to create a more sustainable community.The plan has grown organically from a pilot scheme run through the winter months with Keep Scotland Beautul to a website, action plan and monthly activities.Open to everyone with an interest in achieving a healthy, sustainable future for the village and its surroundings, the plan will work on the whole gambit: from food growing to flood mitigation foraging to forestry and heat pumps to bike pumps # a new cycle repair work-stand has been installed outside the village shop.Joining the online meetings throughout the winter, I was amazed to see not just the number of locals involved, but also the extraordinary talents and interests they share.We only entrenched ourselves full time on this wild wee bit of Argyll a month or two before lockdown so we’re not well-kent faces and, likewise, the faces of many villagers I’ve only ever seen strangely pixellated thanks to my dodgy connection to the Zoom meetings.Hopefully the same is true for wi throughout the area and that my, now ubiquitous, Zoom-accompanying glass of wine has stayed safely out of shot."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Stand Up PaddleboardingSUP for short is a fast-growing outdoor activity and is ideal for all the family. You need to be able to swim but apart from that, the large and stable board, plus buoyancy aid for safety, allows people of all ages to paddle while standing up on calm waters.SUPs can be hired on Loch Lomond, which is the UKrsquos largest area of inland freshwater, as well as on the Isle of Arran, and Loch Morlich, near Aviemore.. CanyoningThis is another adrenalin-fuelled activity that sees participantsdescending a series of waterfalls and pools by jumping, sliding, crawling, climbing, swimming and repelling.The Falls of Bruar in Perthshire are famous for canyoning potential, as well as Tummel and Dollar canyons. Activity providers kit you out in wetsuit, buoyancy aid and helmet, and then lead the way.For a tamer alternative, try gorge walking in locations with easier descents and gentler river flow.. Mountain bikingHire a mountain bike at one of Scotlandrsquos many trail centres and ride routes that are graded green for beginners, through blue, red and black for the most experienced. There are also orange grades for the most technical downhill sections.Visit trail centres such as Glentress near Peebles Laggan Wolftrax near Newtonmore and Comrie Croft in Perthshire, where there are routes for all ages and aspirations.. Canadian canoeingThere are numerous rivers and lochs in Scotland that are ideal for a two-person paddle in an open-top Canadian canoe.To start with, choose a calm day and a waterway that is not choppy. There are plenty of providers that hire Canadian canoes, or you could join a guided trip in locations such as the Great Glen Canoe Trail, the River Spey or Loch Sunart, on the Ardnamurchan peninsula.:Staycation Scotland:  picturesque farm stays to visit this year.

Glasgow BMX Centre is Scotlandrsquos only world and Olympic standard BMX track. You can book taster sessions..

The aim is to navigate between checkpoints or controls marked on a special orienteering map.Permanent courses set up by Scottish Orienteering can now be used with the phone app MapRun.The only dference from a ldquotraditional course is that there are no physical markers on the ground. Instead, the phone tracks your location as you run and vibrates to confirm when yoursquove reached each control point.. Walk with an alpacaAn emerging trend in the outdoors activity world, especially for families with young children, is going for a walk with alpacas. The animals are a domesticated species from South America and very friendly.There are many places now offering walks and treks with alpacas, such as East Lothian, in the Pentlands near Edinburgh, Moray, Fe and on the Solway Coast in Dumfries  Galloway..

Most notably, throughout the pandemic, I have been supporting constituents and businesses with COVID- related matters such as sourcing financial help and dealing with concerns over vaccinations.I have delivered real results for the Borders. I campaigned for the poundm Borderlands funding for a Bordersrsquo Railway extension feasibility study, supported the successful re-instatement of Reston station and called for a fund to fix the crumbling roads. On the rural front, I put pressure on the SNP Government for more funding for agriculture and pushed for more resources to tackle rural crime and fly-tipping.As the Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Older People, I worked with the Scottish Conservative strategy team, to formulate new policies to support older people and matters relating to Social Security Portfolio, such as narrowing the disability employment gap and improving digital inclusion.Looking ahead to the election I will campaign hard for local issues. When it comes to our fantastic NHS, I want a focus on reducing waiting times, improving mental health services and protecting local GP surgeries.As we emerge from the COVID pandemic, we must attract high quality, well-paid jobs to the Borders and improve infrastructure and digital connectivity to bolster the rural economy.On education, I support a national tutoring programme to help pupils catch up, more rural teachers and free school breakfasts and lunches to all primary school children.My campaign, alongside Doddie Weir OBE, continues on automatic access for people living with MND to receive a Blue Badge.

Now, we need to put recovery from the pandemic first. From supporting tourism and local business to tackling the climate emergency, delivering a better education system, supporting the NHS, bettering mental health provision, and making the case for a truly federal UK, I will always stand up for the disadvantaged and will make fairness and tackling inequality central to everything I want to achieve. I want to remove the barriers to opportunity which face rural areas more than others. Everyone should have the chance of living the le they want and to be as successful as possible. During the last year the curtains have been pulled back on where the help is most needed and we need to have a needle sharp focus on getting help to all those in that position.

We must learn from this collective failure.Scientists have warned for decades that the world is heading towards climate breakdown. They also now speak of a ldquonature emergency ndash an era of mass extinctions caused by humans. Yet greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere relentlessly rise and our forests and oceans continue in dangerous decline. Nowadays, I see scientists practically weeping as they watch this unravelling accelerate, with no believable action plan from politicians.The Scottish Greens recognise that technology will play a huge part in stepping us back from the brink. Our co-leader Lorna Slater is a renewable energy engineer, and our proposed poundbn Green Recovery investment programme will fund thousands of high-quality, unionised Scottish jobs in renewables.

He has lived in the Scottish Borders for  years.Vanguard Party champions the Union and Brexit. The UK, four nations in union, will prosper as an independent country, outwith the EU. If Scotland were to leave the Union and join the EU, it would not be an independent country. It would be a rule-taker from Brussels. There would be a hard border with the rest of the UK. Scottish exports to the rest of the UK are currently worth three times those to the EU. Funding via the Barnett formula would end. Scots would lose British citizenship.Vanguard Party believes Scotlands future should be decided by the people, not the courts. However, independence is not practical without the support of a simple majorityof the registered electorate, not merely a simple majority of valid votes. IndyRef must require a simple majority of the registered electorate of the whole of Scotland, for the whole of Scotland to leave.

Most important was keeping in touch with you through my surgeries: in supermarkets, libraries, and my annual summer surgery tour through the villages. This past year of course has changed everything. We have all been stuck at home keeping in touch through emails. COVID has dominated and I have tried to help you with the problems it brought in its wake. Moving now through vaccination, queries arise as you await that appointment. At the same time other issues continue: unsuitable housing, planning concerns. This is the essential work and duty of an MSP to constituents no matter what their politics. I hope I have discharged that duty. I have also chaired the parliamentrsquos cross-party group on animal welfare for many years with two Bills to my name: The Control of DogsAct , now law, putting the blame on the owner not the dog and The Welfare of DogsBill which aims to end casual purchase of puppies. COVID prevented it proceeding butelected I intend to bring it back, especially with concern that some of those \"COVID\" puppies will end up in animal rescue centres. Yes, how le has changed, COVID has been hard: losing a business built over years, living with children trapped in a flat, not attending a funeral, delaying the wedding, the new baby not socialising with family. The list is endless of the sacrices, the losses. COVID has broken the link with the way we were, just as those World Wars changed society. Nicola Sturgeon has demonstrated true leadership and moving to recovery it must not be back to the same old, same old but to a socially just society, valuing people from cradle to grave, our public services, rejoining the EU as an independent nation. On May , I ask for your constituency vote on my record as your MSP and the list vote for the SNP, giving you and Scotland a democratic choice to move forward as a renewed nation.Shona Haslam Shona Haslam, Scottish ConservativesOn Thursday, May , voters are faced with a choice. Rebuild our communities after the pandemic by improving our childrenrsquos education, delivering record funding to our NHS and enhancing employment opportunities, or, once again, reopen the question of Scotlandrsquos place within the United Kingdom.Make no mistake: the next few weeks will see one of the most important elections of our letime.Nicola Sturgeon has demonstrated recently that she only cares about one thing, an independence referendum that most Scots do not want but one that she will still foist upon them anyway. The past year has been tough for us all. Many of us have struggled with the pressures of lockdown, myself included. But the way to recover from this pandemic is not to launch into another constitutional argument that threatens our livelihoods, our childrenrsquos futures and our way of le.As a mum to two lovely boys, I want to see a government that puts aside its own agenda and commits to focusing on whatrsquos best for the next generation of Scots. ldquoJudge me on my record said Nicola Sturgeon on education. Well, the attainment gap remains as large as it ever was, and Scotlandrsquos education system has plummeted in international rankings. It would seem the First Minister has been found wanting.Itrsquos not just our schools that under threat other public services are too. As leader of the Scottish Borders Council, I have fought tirelessly against repeated cuts to our budget, forcing councillors to make dficult choices simply because the Scottish Government finds it easier to pass the buck. After the strain of COVID, we need a Scottish Government that will step up, empower councils and work with them, not against them.Butthe SNP gain enough seats to form a majority in May then all that is at risk. Once again, they will push for another isive referendum.There is only one way to stop that: lend me your constituency vote, and the Scottish Conservatives your party vote, on May .ACMay AC May, Scottish Liberal DemocratsI intend to represent you the only way I know how - by working tirelessly with a keen eye on the future to ensure that there is investment and improvement in education, employment opportunities and business growth. I will stand up for better funded healthcare and demand that money is directed towards care homes, mental health and wellbeing to bring these up to the standards we all deserve. To do this will need a strong economy and the Scottish Liberal Democrats are putting recovery first ndash this must be Scotlandrsquos priority. A vote for me is a vote of confidence for a more secure future for you and your families.Its time for a change. The area needs someone who will heed the concerns of constituents, and voice these strongly in parliament, not just another person sitting in Holyrood applauding every word of the First Minister.Prior to the boundary changes, the Scottish Liberal Democrats had a long record of success here, and its high-time for ato rational, clear thinking on the issues that matter locally and nationally.Our high streets and town centres ndash the beating heart of our communities ndash need urgent help. This was apparent before the pandemic, but even more so now. Online commerce can bring tremendous benefits and is here to stay. Many businesses have transformed to the new normal, but many others have struggled. We need to focus on how growing online spend can coexist with a vibrant local economy, and work to restore community feeling.Im looking forward to getting stuck into the campaign. By their own admission, a ided Tory party has mishandled Brexit, driving Scottish voters in desperation towards nationalism, while the opportunist and populist SNP seeks to compound the disaster of Brexit by withdrawing from the UK completely, just at the point when we need economic recovery the most.A vote for me is a vote for progress through strong partnerships within Scotland, across the UK and with our European neighbours, so that together we can recover from the COVID crisis and move beyond the politics of ision.Katherine Sangster Katherine Sangster, Scottish LabourCOVID-rsquos impact on our families, our communities and our economy has been profound. We now need to start the hard work of rebuilding our country and that task needs new faces, fresh ideas and experience outside of Holyrood.I am a working parent who prior to  had never been involved in politics. However, I like many other parents soon realised that the SNPrsquos childcare policies sound good on the back of an election leaflet but donrsquot work in practice. So, in , I campaigned for fairer access to childcare and led Fair Funding for our Kids - a nationwide campaign that got childcare on to the national agenda, building a movement of mums that demanded action from Government. Our campaign secured more funded childcare from Government - a step towards equality, but there is still plenty to be done.Soon, I was speaking on television, writing for newspapers and lobbying politicians. All things I has never done before but I was speaking from the heart and articulating mine and othersrsquo experience. Now with five years plus experience in politics I still firmly believe that policy is best made by those with lived experience and the job of a politician is to listen and advocate on peoples behalf, and I will always put that at the heart of what I do.Working for an MP now, every day I support people with the issues that blight their lives from poor housing to an inhumane benefits system to bins not getting picked up. These are issues that affect people day in day out. Chatting to voters and speaking to constituents, I have experienced no appetite for debate on a second referendum just a desire from people that we as politicians and aspiring politicians listen to their concerns and respond to those concerns.We need to elect MSPs to Holyrood who understand these concerns and will fully use the powers of the Scottish Parliament to make peoplersquos lives better. Holyrood is one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world lets start using those powers. As Donald Dewar said at the opening of the Scottish Parliament in  ldquoA Scottish Parliament, not an end but a means to greater ends.On May  please use your vote carefully and letrsquos start the task of uniting our country behind our national recovery."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-bank-holiday-offers-big-mac-mcchicken-sandwich","story":"Have you enjoyedthe Bank Holiday weekend a bit too

out of a second lockdown is madness.But local business owners Della Murray and Artur Budenko say it is a leap of faith they are willing to make after taking over the reins of Ramblers Cafeacute in Peebles.The couple, who run a small take-out nestled on Peebles High Street, have been serving the Peeblesshire community throughout the coronavirus pandemic, even going as far as using a taxi

came, we furloughed again and have now brought them all back, and thankfully, we have had no job losses.After surviving the second lockdown, Della said she and Artur were looking to expand as the lease for Ramblers became available.With so many high-street stalwarts collapsing, we asked Della how she felt about taking on a second business during a very uncertain time.She replied:

And now, more than a week later and despite updates in the interim about the reopening of schools, they#re still waiting – and it#s not acceptable.Like everyone , islanders are desperate to know when they can reconnect with family and friends. Island businesses are equally frantic to know when and how they can make plans for the weeks ahead.But, unlike everyone , our islands are at a complete disadvantage. They still don#t know what is happening, or when. They deserve better. The Scottish Government needs to respond to our islands# call for clarity and let them, like the rest of the country, start to think and plan ahead.Now in its nd year, the Big Garden Birdwatch is a chance for people of all ages to count the number of birds that visit their garden helping the Royal Society for the Protection of Birdsto build up a picture of how they are doing.This year, more than a million people across the UK, including more than , in Scotland, took part, counting  million birds.The event, held over the last weekend in January, revealed the house sparrow held on to its number one spot.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past thirteen dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland#s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days.The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best — serving their customers.Reopening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain. Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.The reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints. Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers. Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.The national charity for older people is encouraging people to get moving every day next month as part of a new fundraising activity challenge.Throughout May, Age Scotland is asking people across the country to Spring into Action to help support older people in Scotland.Fundraisers can take part however they choose, but the most important thing is to make sure they are active every day.All funds raised by Spring into Action participants will go towards Age Scotland#s vital services, including the national friendship line, which offers a place older people can turn tothey are in need of support, comfort and reassurance or even just missing a friendly voice.Running and walking events have always been a great way to help raise vital funds and, even with many regular events unfortunately cancelled over the past year, we#ve been overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity shown by fundraisers still going above and beyond.We hope to see as many people as possible taking up our challenge to Spring into Action this May. With nights getting lighter and better weather on the horizon, this is a great excuse to get out and about and support a worthy cause at the same time.#Whether you run one mile, walk five, or design your own challenge, your fundraising efforts will be making a real dference for older people in Scotland.#The money you raise will fund vital services like our friendship line.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  — one of a family of three brothers and four sisters — and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s. In Lancashire in , he married Janet Wardrope, who came from Milngavie outside Glasgow, and they went on to have  children.Going back a few generations, Clare#s research has traced Alexander#s great grandfather, John McNab, born in Kilbrandon in the area around Loch Melfort in .His son Peter, born around , went on to farm in Connel and is recorded in the  census as an -year-old, farming  acres at South Ledaig, though is described as a #smith# in an earlier record.Born in , Peter#s son Alexander grew up to work in farming around Glenorchy. In the  census he is recorded as a ploughman at Barbreck.#Our# Alexander seems to have been a blacksmith when he moved from Argyll to Burnley to start a new le.Sadly, two of Alexander and Janet#s family died as young children.Later, however, they found themselves — like so many other families — caught up in the horrors of the First World War.They lost three sons — Andrew, aged , missing in action,  Alex, , missing in action,  and John, , missing in action,  — during the war.The grief the family must have borne is unimaginable. The boys# names are recorded on three separate First World War memorials in Belgium and France.Clare said: #What a tragedy losing your sons. Andrew, Alex and John were brothers of my great grandma, Grace McNab Bridge.#Alexander died in  at the age of , after being hit by a tramcar in Blackpool during the blackout. He was living with daughter Grace and her family at the time. A short newspaper report from the time describes him as a #retired blacksmith#.Clare was born in Blackpool and moved to Tees-side, via a spell in Dumfries, through her husband David#s employment.Though her great grandmother Grace passed away in , Clare believes she can detect echoes of the past in her own family today.She explained: #My son, who is in army, has just trained in music and learnt the bagpipes.#Little bits keep popping up. My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area.

A big decision has been swept under the carpet.#The budget was reduced by £,, from £, to £,.Douglas Hendry, executive director of customer services, said: #Our process is not to fund routes where there is alternative transport available or where there are less than , people travelling annually.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPiper#s march wins prizeThe Campbeltown piper who won a competition to compose a tune to mark a battle in which many of his comrades fought was presented with his prize on Tuesday # the battle#s rd anniversary.Mr George McIntyre from Meadowburn won a competition run by the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to compose a   march in memory of the Battle of Longstop Hill in .On Tuesday, Longstop Day, Major Hamish Clarkof the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders travelled to Campbeltown to present George with a specially engraved quaich at a ceremony at the Argyll Hotel.Many Kintyre men fought at the battle which was one of the decisive moments in the Second World War against the Germans in North Africa.Major Duncan McMillan, who won the Military Medal at the battle, attended the ceremony along with many of George#s other old army friends.Before he handed the quaich to George, Major Clark said: #I really can#t think of anyone more appropriate to have won the competition than George McIntyre himself.#If George had not been taken prisoner in  he may well have fought at Longstop.#Receiving the quaich, George said: #It gives me great honour to achieve this.#Then Mr Ian McKerral from Kintyre and District Pipe Band gave the first public performance of the tune.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe end of the road for PaulPaul McCartney, who is at the moment staying at High Park Farm, Campbeltown, has just made one giant step forward towards severing all his connections with the other three Beatles.John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr abandoned their appeal against a High Court order on Monday, putting the affairs of their company, Apple, in the hands of a receiver. The three now face a legal costs bill estimated at £,.Mr Morris Finer, QC for John, George, Ringo and Apple, told the appeal court on Monday that they now considered it was in the common interest to explore ways of allowing Paul to free himself from the partnership by agreement.Mr David Hurst QC on behalf of Paul said: #He will most willingly enter into the proposed negotiations to achieve his freedom from the partnership by consent rather than by court action.#Well, it looks very much like the end of the #long and winding road# to quote a well known McCartney ballad.What does Paul himself feel about the rise and fall of the Beatles Two Courier men drove up to High Park Farm — which has a long and decidedly bumpy road leading to it — to find out what the man in the centre of it all felt about things.Apart from being obviously excited about his latest and most important success, Paul did not like saying anything about the matter.Though very polite and friendly, he made it quite clear that he does not see any point in giving interviews or saying anything remotely sensational.After ten years of being harried and hustled by journalists and photographers never having a minute#s peace to himself always having been the centre of attraction never having been able to pop in to the #local#, is it any wonder that Paul is determined to live as quietly as possible He seemed as happy as a sand-boy, out there in the wilds.When we approached him, he had obviously been brushing down one of his horses because he still held a horse brush in his hand.His we Linda looked the essence of happiness as her golden hair mirrored the warm sunshine. The children yelled and gurgled contentedly and even Martha, the English sheepdog, seemed happy.The farm house itself has been extensively renovated, a new roof having been constructed and the farm work appears to be progressing normally.Paul himself has changed. Outwardly at any rate. Gone is the Beatle mop, the style which was copied the whole word over. Gone is the boyish grin, which once sent screaming thousands into ecstasy.What has taken the place of these characteristics  Paul now sports a beard the hair remains longish but it is brushed back, revealing the full extent of his forehead the smile is no longer boyish.The former bass-guitarist song-writer with the most influential and certainly most famous foursome the world has ever known has changed.Paul will probably continue to compose such brilliant songs as Maybe I#m Amazed and Another Day but to millions of people, from Campbeltown to Honolulu, pop music will certainly never be the same again.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and flashesThere would be some fluttering this week among the ladies in the town who are liable to serve on a jury, summonses to appear on the occasion of a forthcoming jury trial having been issued to  ladies and  gentlemen.

If you are taking a long-term view then a garden full of reliable flowering shrubs is also an option.Whatever garden you have, watering and weeding are the key watchwords for May. It is essential to water newly planted fruit trees, roses and shrubs regularly to help their root systems get established.It is also the time of year when many plants# demand for water increases as they start their major growth period. Top watering tips include – every time you plant something, water it in well, make a moat of soil round newly planted plants so that water doesn#t run off and goes to the roots, water pots and containers so that water appears right to the top of the pot and get a water butt.If you have a drainpipe, you have a natural water supply so a simple garden solution for May is to ensure that you have adequate water storage. If you buy and fit a water butt, it will provide you with water for the garden in an environmentally friendly way and on a regular basis.Annual weeds will be popping up now, so weeding borders once a week to prevent weed seedlings establishing is a good idea. The problem with the most common weeds such as nettles, dandelions and bindweed, is that they are very, very tough. They can continue to grow in conditions that make most garden plants simply fade away – and they do that, in part, by using the moisture, nutrients and light of the plants around them.A great plant to get you into the summer gardening spirit is the pretty petunia – perfect for containers and hanging baskets and a great choice for instant colour. It can flower all summer long, providing you deadhead regularly, and comes in a iety of colours to suit any garden palette.Petunias are also available in dferent blooms including single, double, ruffled or smooth petals. They can be striped, veined or solid in colour and most sold today are hybrids developed for specic design purposes such as fragrance.They need full sun and can#t tolerate frost but can grow in a wide range of soils and thrive in multipurpose compost when planted in containers.Keeping on top of garden maintenance is crucial in May. The garden is coming alive so there is plenty to keep you busy. Here are some jobs you should be thinking about this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"calls for patience as vaccination programme continues","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Community benefit and shared ownership must, they say, be made a requirement of all future wind farm projects.They also believe residents are at a disadvantage when dealing with complex, jargon-filled planning proposals, and called for the Scottish Government to enforce better community engagement and provide funding towards professional advice for community councils affected by larger developments falling under section  and  of of the Electricity Act .The government must explore alternative arrangements, added the group, for the re-opening of the Machrihanish wind turbine factory.The height and number of turbines is of increasing concern, with recent applications proposing towers up to  metres high # some  per cent taller than many existing structures.The group believes the cumulative effect will negatively impact the area#s scenic beauty and therefore tourism.Bob Chicken, planning convenor for Tarbert and Skipness Community Council, said: #Our communities# needs are being ignored. We believe that our proposals will strike a fairer balance between the need for greener power and the needs of the remote and rural populations who live and work in the lands used to generate it.#The group#s specic concerns were put to renewable energy industry body Scottish Renewables.Claire Mack, chief executive of Scottish Renewables, replied by saying that rural Scotland had a #central role# to play in delivering clean power for climate change targets.She continued: #The latest UK Government figures show that only  per cent of Scots are opposed to the development of onshore wind farms. That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#Renewables now provide the equivalent of  per cent of Scotland’s electricity consumption, with onshore wind delivering the bulk of that power, employing , people across the country and supporting a thriving supply chain of businesses from the central belt to the Borders, Highlands and Islands.#"},{"url":null,"title":"man drove on forestry road whilst disqualified","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Any forward player will tell you that. If you have a terrible game and score a goal or play fantastic and not score ndash you are judged on your goals as a forward.ldquoHopefully, I will get another goal but I need to make sure I am in the team. I would love another goal and I love the Scottish Cup. I loved it with East Kilbride and Gala Fairydean Rovers ndash it is great and you love those big moments in competitions.Paton moved from Dublin to East Lothian after signing for Hibs around his th birthday.He lived with Helen Leslie and her two sons, Darren and Jonathan, off Tranentrsquos Waterloo Road and attended Ross High School, where he studied physical education, English and sports leadership.The striker was quick to praise both the family and the school for helping him develop. He said: ldquoThey took me in asI was part of their family.ldquoThey were absolutely fantastic to me and made me feel so welcome.ldquoI went for dinner with them and they were brilliant.ldquoIn my first year, I spoke to Sean McPartlin, education and welfare officer, and he askedI wanted to do something. I agreed to it and they said I would train some days.ldquoIt is the best thing I ever did.That saw Paton ide his time between attending school and training at Hibernian Training Centre at East Mains on the outskirts of Ormiston.The -year-old spent two years at the secondary school and told Courier Sport how much he enjoyed the experience. He added: ldquoIt was brilliant ndash the best thing I ever did, honestly.ldquoI was not too keen going to school at that age with football andI had not then I would not have made many friends. The amount of people I met through school was unbelievable.Paul Reynolds, headteacher of the Tranent secondary school, said: ldquoNot only was Ruari a standout footballer, he was a true gentleman.ldquoHe was always extremely polite and his positive attitude was infectious. I have rarely met someone so filled with optimism.ldquoWith his lsquogo get lsquoemrsquo attitude, he settled into Ross High School very quickly and it was a pleasure to have him here.

Still unable to control his weeping, he began to crawl backwards. Izzy opened the door and cradled him as he crumpled onto the floor in the corridor outside the room.Izzy glanced quickly inside, checking Finn was still asleep. He moved for a moment, then turned over. She slowly and carefully closed the door and sat down with Ewen, putting her arms around him.She had no words, but knew words were not what was needed. She just held him in a hug as he wept his soul out.A fellow guest walked by on the way to the showers. He paused for a moment with a towel hanging over his right shoulder.ldquoYou all right  he asked.ldquoMy friend has just had some bad news, said Izzy.ldquoOK, yeah, I can see that, hope it works out, he said awkwardly and headed for the showers.Finally, Ewen began to compose himself and appeared from behind his hands, his face a sodden mess. Izzy took her arms away, gave him a sympathetic look and stood up.ldquoLetrsquos find a place we can sit and talk, she said.Ewen nodded and pulled himself up off the floor with Izzyrsquos help. When they entered the kitchen area, everyone instinctively moved away and left them alone. Ewen sat at a table and Izzy put the kettle on.Then she came and sat next to him, putting a supportive hand on his left arm. They both sat, not speaking. Ewen finally stopped crying and Izzy got up and brought some paper kitchen towels so he could wipe his face, then went to make tea for them both. She ed with two steaming mugs and sat by him again, still not speaking, just being there for him, her best friend.He stared at the mug of tea, lted it to his lips, then spoke before he drank.ldquoI hardly recognised him, he said.He took a gulp of tea and looked up at Izzy.His voice began to break as he tried to explain: ldquoItrsquos been four years since I saw him ndash last time was just before his eighth birthday. Hersquos changed so much. But then I heard his breathing as he slept, thatrsquos the same, I recognised that.He drank some more tea, took in a deep breath, then exhaled loudly with a sigh.ldquoHe used to fall asleep after Irsquod told him a story and I would stay for a while and listen to him breathe.He could feel tears welling up again. ldquoSorry Izzy, I canrsquot help it, so embarrassing.Tears streamed down his cheeks again and he lowered his head.Izzy walked to the sink, tore some more kitchen towels from the rack and gave them to him. She sat by him.ldquoI canrsquot imagine what it feels like, Ewen, all those years of pent-up emotion missing your son, there is no need to apologise. I should have realised how hard that would be for you. It was my mistake.Ewen looked up. ldquoGod no, Izzy, thanks to you Irsquove seen Finn, close up, in the moonlight and sleeping. I was able to whisper to him under my breath that I loved him, just before I lost it and made that scene.Izzy looked round the empty kitchen.ldquoI think everyone in here thinks wersquore a couple whorsquove fallen out, she said. ldquoIrsquom a bit concerned that people will talk about it tomorrow morning and Finn could overhear.

It was just one of the things we used to do. I dunno how we started it.

Izzy wasnrsquot sureshe was making things worse or better for him by telling him such things.ldquoDoes he like his boots  he asked.ldquoLoves them and they fit perfectly.Ewen nodded, then clenched his hands together on the table. Izzy could feel his pain. She placed her hands on top of his.ldquoEwen, you are doing amazing, this must be hell for you, I know how much you love Finn and want him to know it. But please, be careful. He could have seen you at the Falls of Leny, and he definitely saw you talking to me at Balquhidder. Hersquos seen your car.

Izzy wanted to say yes but the womanrsquos concern and kind words triggered a flood of tears. It was her turn to be comforted, by a stranger who knew nothing of the burden she carried, of her guilt and overwhelming feeling of responsibility.ldquoThank you for being so kind, she said to the woman. ldquoI feel much better now after a wee greet.ldquoNo man is worth such upset, my lovely, the kind woman said.

Izzy felt emotionally exhausted and hoped shersquod fall asleep quickly, but as she lay in her bed after a hot shower, she couldnrsquot stop her mind racing it had been so close, whatFinn had woken  She trusted Ewen to be careful. But she must be careful too. Finally, under the gaze of MacFarlanersquos Lantern, sleep overtook her.Finn was first to wake in the morning.ldquoAunty, aunty, itrsquos morning! he said while looking out of the window. It was daylight but the sky had clouded over and thick mist hung on the hills.ldquoA typical Highland morning, he said cheerfully.Izzy got things packed as Finn had his shower and they left the hostel before most of the other residents were out of their beds. After a phone call to Finnrsquos mum, they set off.ldquoWhere we having breakfast  asked Finn.ldquoVery close by, on the banks of Loch Dochart.They drove for just a few minutes and pulled into a layby. Izzy performed her usual routine of bringing her rucksack. They walked through some woodland and arrived at the waterrsquos edge.ldquoWow, is that an island with a castle on it  asked Finn.ldquoIt is, said Izzy, ldquoand what stories are here! Irsquoll tell you some over breakfast.Finn helped Izzy set up her stove and they took turns stirring the porridge. There were midges in the air, at times annoying, but it was late in the season and their biting was minimal. A breeze from the loch kept them away most of the time.She told Finn of the castlersquos history, how the island was once a MacGregor stronghold, but that lsquoBlack Duncan Campbellrsquo built the castle they saw now after he took the land.Then Izzy told an ancient legend: ldquoIt was here that Fionn MacCoul met his death, at the hands of a giant named Taileachd.Finn scooped more porridge into his bowl but he nodded, showing he was listening and wanted Izzy to continue.ldquoThe giant lived with his sweetheart, who was a beautul faery maiden.ldquoOf course, said Finn, smiling cheekily.Izzy ed the smile and continued: ldquoSome versions of the tale say they had their home on an island on Loch Lubhair, just downstream, while others an island here on Loch Dochart, maybe even that one.Finn studied the castlersquos ruins, which peered out from the trees which covered the island. It looked so mysterious.ldquoOne day, Taileachd discovered that his sweetheart had met Fionn and they had fallen in love.ldquoSo Fionn ran off with her, thatrsquos ironic! laughed Finn.ldquoNo, you see she loved them both, maybe in dferent ways, but she was now torn between them. They were going to fight over her, and she knew one of them would be killed, so she came up with an idea.Finn put his bowl down and listened as Izzy acted out the tale.ldquolsquoPlease put your anger awayrsquo, said the faery woman. lsquoI love you both, but whoever can leap the furthest I shall be with.rsquoldquoA jumping competition! exclaimed Finn.ldquoExactly!Izzy dramatically described how the two competitors leapt from the island trying to outperform each other. They were equally matched but when they jumped backwards, Fionn momentarily lost his balance and the giant, fearful he was going to lose his sweetheart, took the opportunity to cut off Fionnrsquos head!ldquoAw, ouch, foul! cried Finn.Izzy nodded and spoke with a solemn tone.ldquoIn that moment of violence, they all lost everything. The faery woman fled: she no longer loved Taileachd because of his brutal act, and Fionn, whom she loved, had lost his le. His body floated down the river, and was found by the Fiann, his band of warriors. They buried him at Killin and now they were full of vengeance, so went to search for Fionnrsquos murderer.ldquoDid they find him ldquoWell, Taileachd fled to Rannoch Moor and Irsquoll tell you what happened when we get there, later today.ldquoAw, aunty!Finnrsquos protest was interrupted as his attention was suddenly caught by the sight of a man in a dinghy rowing out into the loch. They watched as he struggled a bit in the current, then vanished behind the eastern side of the island. A few minutes later, the man appeared on top of the ruined tower, half hidden by branches. He sat there.Finn waved and the man waved back.ldquoI really want to go onto that island and see the castle and where the giant lived. Maybe that man will lend us his dingy ldquoHersquos probably going fishing, Finn, and is just looking at the water to see where the fish are. Hersquoll be there all day.ldquoWe could swim ldquoThe current is too strong here Finn, but we could swim at out next stop: St Fillanrsquos healing pool, itrsquos part of the river, just upstream from here.Finn stood by the waterrsquos edge looking out to the island, disappointed.

It seems very unfair that we should no longer be able to use a road that we pay for to access the hills.I noticed a picture on Facebook, taken on a sunny Sunday when people would normally be out enjoying a walk around the reservoir, but only one car seems to be using the car park.As East Lothian grows, we should be utilising as much of our outdoor space as possible to help our population exercise and take pressure off coastlines and popular woodland areas. The Lammermuir Hills are underused for recreation and have a superb network of paths, but woefully inadequate parking.Overriding everything in the letter you printed is the Scottish Governments Land Reform Act of , which clearly states the Right for Responsible Access in Scotland.. The overall framework of land rights, responsibilities and public policies should promote, fulfil and respect relevant human rights in relation to land, contribute to public interest and wellbeing, and balance public and private interests. The framework should support sustainable economic development, protect and enhance the environment, help achieve social justice and build a fairer society.. There should be a more erse pattern of land ownership and tenure, with more opportunities for citizens to own, lease and have access to land.The landownerrsquos decision to heavily restrict parking prejudices families, those with disabilities and groups who take people walking in the hills and need an access point. I understand that during the last year, the countryside has suffered littering, fires and irresponsible parking, but to punish responsible visitors because of the behaviour of a minority is a knee-jerk reaction and will only create animosity towards the estate at a time when public opinion is turning against grouse shooting. Instead, the landowner should be working with local residents, East Lothian Council and interested parties to help improve access and educate visitors on how to visit responsibly.Name and address supplied"},{"url":null,"title":"builders-merchant-built-instead-hotel-former-raceland-site","story":"The former Raceland karting site, between Gladsmuir and Longniddry, closed in early .Work is due to start later this year on a petrol station, two drive-thru restaurants and a drive-thru cafe on the southern section of the site.Initial proposals suggested a hotel could be built on the northern part of the former karting site, where the outdoor track was located, but that could now be ditched for a buildersrsquo merchants.The karting centre was given planning permission in  and also operated a paintball centre.

Olsen Renewables, their Reporters ruled none of the objections were strong enough to support refusing planning permission for the turbines.The operators had argued that the case for renewable energy outweighed concerns over the giant turbines.They said: ldquoThe need case for renewable energy development is greater than ever before. Consequently, it would take a local impact of overwhelming importance to justy a refusal of consent, and there is none.East Lothian Council objected to plans to extend the Crystal Rig windfarm project, which straddles its border with the Scottish Borders, over plans to put red lights on top of them to meet CivilAviation Authority regulations.They said: ldquoThe Lammermuirs form the backdrop to East Lothian. The skyline, especially where unbroken, characterises East Lothian.ldquoThe area is characterised by a lack of lighting, creating the perception of an undeveloped area at night.Objecting to the need to put aviation lights on the new turbines because of their height, the council said: ldquoA good example for red lighting when views from East Lothian are the lights on the cranes at the St James Centre. These show how clearly red light travels and that the intensity of the light and weather conditions makes little dference to the distance it can be viewed at. The lighting here is easily visible from the Garleton Hills, a similar distance as the proposed Crystal Rig turbines are from Tranent.Representatives from Mayshiel and Cranshaws Estates also lodged objections, saying the inclusion of -metre-high turbines in the latest plans should be very carefully considered.Comparing them to the height of the Queensferry Crossing towers, they said: ldquoIt is a stalking horse prelude to the proposed re-powering of the early phases of Crystal Rig with turbines of this height.The proposals for Crystal Rig IV will see a further  wind turbines placed in the Lammermuir Hills.The latest phase of the Crystal Rig project will take the number of turbines on the site to more than .The Reporters said of the lighting concerns: ldquoWe find that very few people would be affected by visibility of the lights to a signicant degree, including those living in the small number of residential properties located within, or just beyond, three kilometres of the application site.And they dismissed claims by East Lothian Council that ldquoa memory of a familiar view should be taken into account in an assessment of landscape impact.They concluded: ldquoWe are satisfied that the applicant has had regard to the potential signicant effects of the proposed development.ldquoWe have considered the responses and found no grounds on which to disagree with [the applicantsrsquo] assessments of the application.Scottish Ministers issued consent for the turbines."},{"url":null,"title":"polling-station-scottish-election-2021-details-explained","story":"The scale of ldquoSuper Thursday means that every voter in Great Britain will be able to take part in at least one type of poll, making it the biggest event of its kind outside a general election.How does the voting system work Scots will elect  MSPs, the outcome of which will give an indication of the level of support for the SNPrsquos push for a fresh referendum on independence.People will cast two ballots under the additional member system ndash a form of proportional representation ndash electing both constituency and regional MSPs.Votes for the inidual candidates in the  constituencies are counted first.The  regional MSPs ndash split across eight regions ndash are elected using a formula aimed at ensuring that the number of seats a party gets in total across a region is about the same as the percentage of votes it receives.And with more than . million people registered to vote in the upcoming Holyrood election, voters are now being encouraged to make sure theyre ready to vote on  May.The final total of voters registered for the Scottish Parliament election has been confirmed at ,, ndash the highest electorate ever for a Scottish Parliament election.You can find out where your local polling stationis by checking with your local council or by entering your postcodehere.Polling stations are open from am to pm onThursday May , .You must vote at your assigned polling station, however you dont need your poll card to vote.If you are registered to vote, but you dont have your poll card, you can go to the polling station and give them your name and address.In England, Wales and Scotland, you dont need any form of ID.However, in Northern Ireland, you must bring photo ID.Local election teams located at polling stations across the country will be doing everything they can to ensure polling stations aresafe for everyone.Certain safety measures will be in place in order to prevent the spread of Covid-, including the following:"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-second-substation-former-cockenzie-power-station-site-lodged-council","story":"The latest planning application, from Seagreen Wind Energy, shows a substation built on top of a former gasholder site stretching across paths which the firm admits may have to be erted.Seagreen sparked local concern when its initial consultation appeared to put the entire Greenhills in its proposed site.However, the plans now lodged with the council show the substation across the road from the former Cockenzie Power Stationrsquos main footprint on an old gasworks area now being used for a temporary car wash business.Acknowledging concerns raised by community councils over the loss of green space, Seagreenrsquos application says: ldquoAs far as possible, the proposed substationwill be sited to avoid any areas of habitat value.

Officially revealed at the  Geneva Motor Show, the Mini took the motoring world by storm, thanks to its retro looks and classy interior. Then, when they hit the road, it soon became clear BMW had crafted a car that wasnt just great to look at, but great to drive too.Prices started at pound, for the Mini One, rising to pound, for the more powerful Cooper iant, with both being built in Oxford and hitting the market in the UK two months before anywhere  in the world.Arrival of the Cooper SHot on the heels of the One and Cooper iants came the Cooper S. With performance in mind, it combined a .-litre petrol engine with a supercharger, resulting in a lot more power than the standard version. It had a more focused suspension set-up too, while the bonnet air intake became a design feature for all future Cooper S models.Production ramps upIncredibly, by May  ndash just over a year since it went on sale ndash the ,th Mini was produced at BMW Groups Oxford plant. It was a testament to the success of the design and execution of the Mini, thats for sure.The Mini goes drop-topFlash forward to  and the Mini Convertible arrived, bringing that wind-in-your-hair experience to the already-popular model. It still retained space for four, but used a fabric roof that folds up behind the rear seats and didnt require a cover.The boot may have been small at  litres with the roof open, but as with the rest of the range, the Convertible sold like hotcakes.Arrival of the GPThings took a turn for the more serious, with the arrival of the GP in . Limited to just , models worldwide ndash with  made available to UK buyers ndash the lighter, faster and meaner GP sold out before a single customer had even driven a car.Arriving as the most powerful production Mini to date, it used the same .-litre supercharged petrol engine as the Cooper S, but it was boosted for more power while plenty of weight was stripped from the cabin to make the GP even more exciting to drive.The dficult second albumIn August , Mini chose to reveal its second-generation car. It retained the same retro look like the original but was bigger and more efficient than before. The .-litre engine was changed, while the Cooper S used turbocharging instead of supercharging for the first time. Prices increased, too, with the One starting from pound, and the Cooper commanding pound,.Here comes the ClubmanMini took its first step in expanding the range with the introduction of the Clubman in . Debuting a new, estate car-like layout, the Clubman offered more space than the conventional hatch but retained the standard cars nimble handling and punchy range of engines.The start of electricationAt the  Los Angeles Auto Show, Mini presented the E, an electric concept. It created  Mini E vehicles, which were shipped for testing by private customers in Calornia, New York and New Jersey, with the results from this trial relayed back to Mini. It also helped BMW to develop its electric i model.The Countryman hits the roadNot content with the Clubman, Mini expanded the range in  with the Countryman. Taking advantage of the growing appetite for SUVs, the Countryman effectively took the Mini recipe and raised it further off the ground.It had seating for five, four doors and a reasonably large boot. It also retained the same funky styling that you got from the standard hatch.The Roadster and Coupe add even more styleMoving along to  saw the introduction of the Mini Coupe, a two-seater version of the standard hatch which was famously styled to resemble a backwards-facing baseball cap. It was joined by a soft-top version ndash the Roadster. It used a fabric roof like the standard convertible, but had a sleeker, more aerodynamically focused design.A change of pace for MiniIn , Mini introduced the Paceman, which represented a mash-up of an SUV and hatchback. In truth, it was a slightly odd combination, as it had an upright body style but just three doors. Sitting alongside the rest of the Mini line-up, it saw the firms range of cars swell to seven.Third times the charmShortly after the introduction of the Paceman came the introduction of a third-generation hatch. It debuted a new interpretation of the cars classic styling, but was still built in Oxford and was centred around that fun-to-drive experience. Arriving in , the third-generation hatch was bigger in every sense and utilised .-litre three-cylinder engines ndash though the more powerful Cooper S benefitted from a four-cylinder, .-litre petrol.The Mini gains a set of doorsShortly after the arrival of the third-generation Mini came a new, five-door iant, which brought improved rear legroom, a third rear seat, and a more accessible cabin. It has continued to be a great option even today.The Clubman ndash betteredMini followed on from the revitalisation of its hatchback with the introduction of a revised Clubman. It was bigger than before but retained the useful split rear doors, which gave access to a larger boot than before.An electried CountrymanIn , Mini showcased a real attempt at electrication with its Countryman Plug-in hybrid. The first hybrid model to be offered by the brand, it combined a three-cylinder petrol engine with an electric motor and batteries. Capable of driving for up to  miles on battery-power alone, it was easily the most economical car in Minis stable.The Mini goes electricThe year  proved to be a big deal for Mini, as it was when the companys first EV arrived in showrooms ndash the Mini Electric. Its styling was largely unchanged over the regular petrol and diesel models, while a zippy electric motor ensured it delivered the same winning driving experience. The Mini Electric has gone on to prove popular, despite its relatively short range of  miles.The present dayIn January , Mini presented the latest incarnation of its famous hatchback, delivering a new look and a range of technology updates. Though the styling was classical Mini, some key refinements ndash such as a new body-coloured front grille ndash ensure that it has remained looking sharp and up to date."},{"url":null,"title":"gardening-squirrel-proof-bird-feeders-actually-work","story":"Gardening: Do squirrel-proof bird feeders actually work A squirrel feederI have long had a problem with grey squirrels. They feast on birdseed in trays, play acrobatics to jump on fat ball feeders and make light work of scaling metal poles to steal the peanuts from my bird feeders.So, is there really a squirrel-proof feeder which works Matthew Tume, RSPB product manager of birdcare and optics, says that in reality, no product on the market is totally squirrel-proof.\"Squirrels are very intelligent and very determined, and they will find ways around things.\"However, Rachel Schofield, of birdfood and wildle product specialist CJ Wildle, says: \"Theres a great number of really good squirrel-proof feeders on the market, as far as adult squirrels are concerned. Juveniles, however, can squeeze through protective cages.\"What material should you go for \"Metal and preferably powder-coated. Plastic feeders wont last very long. You can buy protective cages for many feeders, but its cheaper to buy an integrated unit,\" says Schofield.\"Squirrels can chew through plastic ports, so we would recommend you use metal feeders, rather than plastic ones,\" Tume agrees.What about birdseed Youre best off with a no waste seed mix, says Schofield, which will help deter pigeons and squirrels from picking up the discarded husks which smaller birds deposit on to the ground. You can buy huskless seeds and sunflower hearts.\"De-husked ieties will be more expensive, but you get what you pay for. Reputable companies which sell good quality seed mixes wont pack them full of wheat or maize. And using de-husked ieties means that birds dont lose time trying to get to the nutrients,\" says Schofield.Where should I put the feeders \"Set them away from jumping-off points, such as fences and hanging trees. However, there is a balance. You want your feeders to have a degree of cover, as the further out in the open they are, the easier it is for predators - such as birds of prey - to spot them,\" says Tume.Are there any other ways to deter squirrels Some people suggest dusting the birdseed with chilli powder or hot sauce like Tabasco, which apparently doesnt bother the birds, but the squirrels dont like the spice, says Tume.Others recommend smearing your bird feeder poles with Vaseline to stop the squirrels climbing up them.Or, you could always try putting up a squirrel feeder at the other end of the garden, away from your bird station, and give visiting squirrels some peanuts of their own.On test: Which squirrel deterrents should I consider Feeder s\"There are feeder s, which are effectively cages which go around your feeders. You hang your feeders inside the cage. The idea is that the cage holes are big enough for small birds to enter and exit safely, and small enough to act as a deterrent for squirrels. They make it more dficult for squirrels to access, but juveniles will be able to squeeze through,\" says Tume.\"Smaller birds - such as blue tits, goldfinches and greenfinches - will be able to fly in and out of the cages, but larger birds - such as jackdaws and magpies - may be deterred, although magpies have long necks, so may be able to reach through to get the seed, depending on the gap between the cage wall and the feeder.\"They should be made to the exact specication which allows small birds in safely, but also deters adult squirrels and large birds,\" he adds.Tried  Tested: The Squirrel  Port Adventurer withThis was the only item which really stopped the squirrel in its tracks. It managed to jump on to the top of the feeder from a tall shrub but was too big to get through the metal guard. It even tried to open the lid of the tubular feeder, but couldnt get in.Squirrel bafflesThese are plastic domes which fit either over the bird feeder, or half way up the poleyou are securing the feeder from the ground, but under the feeding stations. They aim to prevent squirrels from descending on to or climbing up to the feeders.\"If they manage to climb on to the baffle, the baffle often rocks the squirrels loose, so they fall off,\" says Tume. \"We get mixed feedback on them.\"Tried  Tested: The Squirrel Guard Baffle This cone did stop the squirrels from climbing up to reach the feeder, but one managed to get on to the feeder from above, and then accessed the food. However, once Id moved the pole away from tall shrubs and trees from which it could gain access, the baffle worked very well.The weighted feederSquirrel Buster feeders are weighted devices which shut off access to the feeding points when a squirrel or heavy pigeon lands on them, via a metal shutter. These are widely available and one of the most popular deterrents.Tried  Tested: The Squirrel Buster Peanut Birdfeeder I made the mistake of hanging this weighted feeder from a bracket on my garden fencepost, which enabled the squirrel to access the peanuts by taking its weight on its back legs on the fence and then gently placing its front paws on the feeder.It didnt manage to get much food though, as the feeder bobbed up and down as its weight distribution changed. Place the feeder in a clear space with no other balancing points nearby, and it will be much more effective."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-election-2021-scotlands-voting-system-differ-uk-elections","story":"But what does it all mean and how does Scotland actually elect a parliament Heres a look at Scotlands voting system and how it dfers from a Westminster election Scottish Elections: The voting systemScotlandis ided into  constituencies and each constituency elects one MSP.

One of the main issues with the Westminster system and First Past The Past is that it is not proportional. In theory, the combined vote against the winner is often more than voted for the winner, and Scotlands voting system attempts to tackle this by bringing in a second vote.The Second VoteThe Additional Member System , based on the German mixed-member proportionalsystem, is used in Scotland and is signicantly more proportional than FPTP. Such an election system is known as a hybrid electoral system. AMS means that the overall number of MSPs elected for each party is roughly proportional to their electoral support. This system is used to electthe  additional members.The second vote is used to elect  additional members that will complete the political landscape of Holyrood. Scotland is ided into  parliamentary regions and each region elects  regional MSPs. In the second vote the voter votes for a party rather than a candidate.

We cannot manage what we cannot measure, which is why it is often left out of the carbon equation.:Claire Taylor: Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureThis could all be about to change. Last week saw the launch of a global farm metric ndash a common benchmark to measure the sustainability of food and farming. I attended a TEDx event hosted by the Sustainable Food Trust which is leading a new coalition to establish a standardised approach for assessing the sustainability credentials of dferent farms. A common toolkit which will be rolled out internationally and will allow us to present a harmonised approach to measuring and managing agriculturersquos global emissions.Finally, the role our grasslands play in storing carbon will be properly recorded and recognised for their valuable contribution towards our journey to net zero emissions. It is now up to the next Scottish Government to embrace this global farm metric and start recognising farming as part of the solution.Farming practices will have to change to be part of this journey and I believe from speaking to farmers and reading the manestorsquos of dferent farming organisations that they are ready and up to the challenge, but this sht in production will require long term commitments over future funding.If farmers are going to be tasked with producing more environmentally friendly food which comes with a higher price tag, this has to be reflected in the value of food or  farmers will continue to need subsidies in order to keep food affordable for the public.Farmers today are producing food which is sold at the same price as it was  years ago. The same certainly canrsquot be said for the price of clothing, petrol or house prices.If we as consumers really value a future where low carbon produce becomes a staple in our shopping baskets, then we might have to start footing some of the bill.We all go into our local supermarket with the moral intentions of choosing food which supports good animal welfare and boasts environmental protections, but % of us go in and buy based on price.Food is cheap and we are so disconnected from the way it is produced that we often donrsquot value it and think nothing of throwing it away. Why  do we allow % of UK food to end up in the bin But are we lazy consumers with a disregard for seasonality and the origins of our food, or is it simply that we are overwhelmed by too much choice on the shelves that we canrsquot begin to understand the impact of our purchases :Claire Taylor: Blue Peter has no right to push an anti-meat agendaWe all might recognise a free-range egg label or red tractor assurance mark, but do we really feel equipped to make informed choices on the sustainability of our purchases  I back the proposals by the Scottish Greens and the SNP to introduce carbon labelling, but will it not all ultimately come back to a case of price During the TEDx event, the Chief Executive of Morrisonrsquos explained: ldquoChoice often means the balance between price and quality, price and provenance, price and healthier ingredients, but it always comes down to price.Morrisonrsquos have a clever solution to remove the pressure from consumers and place the onus on themselves to provide sustainable produce on their shelves. In March they announced that they would only be supplied by net zero carbon farms by  and will be working with their  farmers and growers to produce affordable net zero carbon meat, fruit, vegetables, and eggs. This takes away the uncertainty and ambiguity for its customers.As a nation emerging from a pandemic with rising levels of poverty and social inequality, we cannot expect the public to be putting sustainability at the top of their list, but longer term the responsibility will have to be shared by consumers.We as the public need to play our part in tackling the climate emergency and committing to responsible food choices is a good place to start. We need to start valuing the produce on our shelves and nipping in the bud the throwaway culture which has resulted from our disconnect.There is an urgency to rebuild our relationship with food and our understanding of how it Is produced. All roads lead back to education, and by introducing sustainable food production as part of the national curriculum will equip the next generation with the knowledge to make responsible food choices.Constitutional issues cannot be allowed to dominate and ide discussion over the next five years. A collaborative approach is needed to properly address and tackle the looming climate emergency and how our food is produced, purchased, and consumed has to be front and centre of policy decisions."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-high-fliers-down-to-earth-attitude","story":"WRITER and producer Mark Millar is one of the most in-demand hotshots in Hollywood, constantly developing high-profile films and TV shows.Jupiterrsquos Legacy, his latest series, hits Netflix this Friday, and the Coatbridge-raised mover-and-shaker celebrated in style, like a true movie mogulhellip by enjoying a day in Ayr with the family.The weather was freezing and the kids complained piteously while icy rain hammered their faces as they shuddered on the beach.ldquoBut theyrsquoll look back on all this with fond memories, claims Mark, who also enjoyed a deep-fried pizza and chips at a local cafeacute.Game fellaITrsquoS a torrid tale of a chap shedding his inhibitions.

The Michelin star has brought great joy and while it was disappointing that we couldnrsquot share it with people at the time in lockdown, it makes it all the more exciting when we do open the doors and welcome people in, said Ms McNee, who trained with the late Andrew Fairlie at his two Michelin star restaurant at the five star Gleneagles hotel.ldquoI donrsquot think there is any feeling like it having a Michelin star. It is amazing and for me as a young chef starting out that is what I strived for. It is quite surreal.ldquoReopening will be about a celebration and it is a time when people will once again be able to mark important milestones and come together in a way they have not be able to recently. It is not just about making great food, it is about being able to bring people into the restaurant and to start to enjoy themselves again.Read more: Covid Scotland: Pandemic set to open floodgates for damages claims, says legal expertWhile diners have still be able to connect with Cail Bruich through the hugely successful dine at home menus, reopening as a Michelin star restaurant while undoubtedly spark a lot of interest.ldquoI think we will get a iety of people through our doors. There are people who travel to Michelin star restaurants from all over the UK, we have our loyal customers and then there might be people in the Glasgow area who havenrsquot had the opportunity to go to a Michelin star restaurant before and will come along, added the -year-old from Morayshire. ldquoWe know that what we do wonrsquot be to everyonersquos tastes, but there will be people who will want to come now because we have the Michelin star.Congratulations came in from the Glasgow hospitality industry and further afield when the announcement was made. There was also messages from fellow Michelin starred chefs now that Ms McNee and Cail Bruich have joined the elite club. Following on from the Michelin star, champagne house Krug invited Ms McNee to become an Ambassade, part of a network of top chefs who develop dishes paired with the fine brand.ldquoGlasgow was very supportive of us when we received the award and we had lots of lovely messages,\" said the head chef who was just five months into her new role when they were awarded the star. \"We really felt that the city had got behind us. The Michelin star is a great boost to the city and the hospitality industry in Glasgow. It can make others more competitive and to strive to be as good as they can and it also made people happy that someone had brought a Michelin star back to the city.Menu planning has been underway for some time and the restaurant opened its reservation book last Friday, April , to welcome people back on Wednesday May . And while not giving too many secrets away, there is a little hint of what diners can expect.Ms McNee added: ldquoIt will be a tasting menu we have on offer when we reopen. There wonrsquot be a massive change, but we want to continually get better and better in everything we do.ldquoWhen we closed our doors before lockdown, it was autumn and as someone who is passionate about seasonal produce, so the menu is going to reflect summer and late spring. Scottish asparagus will be in season when we open so expect to see that on the menu along with langoustines which are my absolute favourite. We are also experimenting with duck dishes and how long we are going to age it.ldquoThe team have been tasters, from the kitchen to front of house. Their input and opinion is important. With young chefs they might not have a fully developed palate yet so it is about bringing them on and with front of house it is important they know about the suppliers, how it tastes, to be able to help diners make their informed choice.The Cail Bruich team already had a good relationship with suppliers in the area and across Scotland when they were awarded the Michelin star, but it did lead to some people getting in touch with them direct.ldquoThere have been some places who got in touch such as Blackthorn Scottish Sea Salt [from Ayrshire] who sent their product which is phenomenal. So we will be using that because I think it is a great product and offers something in terms of taste.When bookings opened on Friday, general manager Chris Donnachie said they werenrsquot quite sure what to expect following lockdown closures. However, they werenrsquot left disappointed as by the end of the day they were fully booked to near the end of June, the period of time they had opened bookings up for.ldquoI think there was a little apprehension as we had been closed for some months now, but the response has been quite unbelievable, said Mr Donnachie. ldquoWe are fully booked through to near the end of June which was the point we wanted to get to as covid restrictions may well ease further from then.ldquoWhen Cail Bruich was awarded the Michelin star earlier this year, we would have loved to have been able to open the next day to mark that but it was a time of lockdown. Such a huge part of what we do and revel in is the social interaction with our guests. Scotland has such a warmth in the sense of its hospitality and we love providing that experience.Working in partnership with Scottish brands to develop their own offerings has seen Cail Bruich work with Glasgow-based The Garden Shed Drinks Company to stock their own gin, a collaboration with beer firm Pilot and they are also planning to stock their own tonic water through a link up with Walter Gregorrsquos handcrafted tonic firm.As for the future the Cail Bruich team believe a second Michelin star is not an unrealistic expectation and they have also added to the team with the addition of two new front of house staff and two new kitchen staff.ldquoWhen we reopen we want to smash it out the park and exceed expectations and we certainly do have aspirations for a second star, added Mr Donnachie. ldquoWe believe we have the capability to do that with a fantastic team."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-referendum-wont-happen-neither-side-wants-one","story":"Boring because there has been no contest ndash everyone knows the winner already. Signicant because it could mean the end of the United Kingdom. At least, that is the view of the London media. The reality is both boring and signicant: there is not going to be a referendum because neither side actually wants one right now.Curiously, the expectation of a referendum seems to be greater in Westminster than in Holyrood. Weve been hearing muffled cries of panic from Whitehall for months. Former Cabinet Office mandarins like Ciaran Martin insist that following this victory for the parties of independence there is ldquono democratically legitimate basis to refuse a referendum. Boris Johnson is still minded to say ldquonow is not the time, but his constitutional insecurity is demonstrated by the fact that hes afraid to show his face in Scotland to defend the Union at this critical juncture.There is talk of a court challenge against the SNPs forthcoming independence bill. Thatsthe Scottish Government doesnt get there first. Theres also going to be ldquobillions on road and rail spending with a Union Flag on it ndash even a ldquofixed crossing to Northern Ireland, or so were told. The Internal Market Act will allow the UK Government to spend over the heads of Holyrood and win hearts and minds. Well, perhaps.Read more: WhatBoris Johnson rejects second referendum Yet curiously, Nicola Sturgeon has insisted that this election ldquois not about independence. The very idea! Its about her ldquosensible leadership and recovery from Covid, under the only political leader who seems to want the job. A referendum will not happen until ldquothe crisis is over, which could be many years since the economic Covid crisis has yet to begin.This may seem like a remarkable about-face for the SNP leader. For the past two years, she has talked of little  but a referendum on independence. Even Covid was expressed in constitutional terms: ldquoAn independence referendum is an essential priority, she said repeatedly,Scotland was to build back better after the pandemic.As recently as November, her Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, insisted that there would a referendum ldquonext year by which he meant . The Constitution Secretary, Michael Russell, said in January that the referendum would happen by Christmas, with or without a Section  Order from Westminster. ldquoThe Franchise Act was approved last year, he said, ldquoso the nuts and bolts are there.Buttomorrows election is really all about ldquoseeking a clear endorsement for a referendum on independence as Ms Sturgeon told parliament in September, you might have thought it would be right up there, centre stage. Yet two words absent from the SNP leaflet that came through my door last week were ldquoindependence and ldquoreferendum. It seems it no longer regards it a necessary precondition for Covid recovery or for keeping Mr Johnsons grasping Brexit hands off the fragile powers of the Scottish Parliament.The UK Government regards all this as devious down-playing of indyref rhetoric, all the better to propel Scotland into holding one. On Saturday, it thinks, she will suddenly declare that this election had ldquoof course been about an independence referendum, and that the mandate for holding one is now unanswerable. Ms Sturgeon will no doubt say something like this, but I dont think that means there will be a referendum on the timescale her minions had been suggesting. Ms Sturgeon isnt a loser, and her recent silence on crucial post-Brexit issues of border, currency and debt betrays her lack of confidence in winning any early referendum.Read more: Sturgeonrsquos border problem could possibly kill Yes vote stone deadThe First Minister made clear this week that she favours turning indyref into a battle in the courts. When ldquothis crisis is over Holyrood will pass a bill declaring a referendum and then defy Westminster to strike it down. Actually, it doesnt have to because no act of Holyrood, especially one on the constitution, can pass without the express endorsement of the UK Parliament.It was clear in the Miller case in  that the UK Supreme Court, which would ultimately decide this matter, takes a maximalist view of parliamentary sovereignty. It believes that Westminster can safely ignore any act of the Scottish Parliament. The Sewel Convention, which supposedly requires Westminster to consent to acts of Holyrood, is just that: a convention. The constitution is one of the reserved powers retained at Westminster under the  Scotland Act.In response, the Scottish Governments lawyers will argue that, while Holyrood cannot legislate for a legally-binding referendum on independence, it can legislate for and hold a consultative referendum. Ms Sturgeon has long accepted that a full-fat referendum would require a Section  Order from Westminster, but an indy-lite plebiscite, just asking the views of Scottish voters, is probably within Holyroods powers. Local authorities are empowered to hold referendums on water privatisation and road pricing, so why shouldnt Holyrood Whether she would actually want such a non-binding referendum is of course another matter. I seriously doubtshe would because it would likely be meaningless. Since it carries no constitutional weight, most unionists would likely boycott it. It would be like the  Catalonian referendum in which  per cent voted Yes on a % turnout. It might carry even less meaning than a series of opinion polls, which are probably a more accurate reflection of what Scotland actually thinks.So why bother with pursuing this through the courts  Well, perhaps because it would be a way of parking the whole independence issue. Indeed, fighting a phoney war about a referendum that will never happen might suit both sides. Passions would overflow in the synthetic world of social media while lawyers exchanged abstruse formulations of a problem that doesnt actually exist about a referendum that would never happen.Its something a French post-modernist, like Jean Baudrillard would instantly recognise: a meta-battle fought over signs and signiers of independence rather than self-government itself. A simulacrum of political reality. Meanwhile, le goes on until Ms Sturgeon departs to write that book she has promised.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

It would be easy to point out that in that same year we also got Brexit, and as Sir Tom Devine says: ldquoI cannot recall any issue of such magnitude since  [the Act of Union] where the manest will of the Scottish people, as confirmed explicitly by virtually all the nationrsquos MPs in the UK Parliament, and overwhelmingly by a democratic vote in a UK referendum, was not only rejected, but treated with such brazen contempt by a British Government.David Cameronrsquos am announcement on the day after the referendum vote, of Evelwas not a good start. This is particularly so as Scotland, during successive Conservative governments, had become used to legislation which the majority of Scottish MPs had voted against . However, since then there have been a iety of actions by the UK Government which confirm, without a shadow of a doubt, Sir Tomrsquos view of Brexit.In particular the Internal Market Act is contrary to devolution powers in a number of areas, including food and environmental standards because of the Actrsquos requirement of ldquomutual recognition of standards, so that, for instance, food produced to lower standards where can still be sold in Scottish shops, irrespective of legal requirements in Scotland. Moreover, the Actrsquos ldquomarket access principles could lead to the privatisation of the Scottish NHS, again irrespective of the views of the elected Scottish Government.But perhaps the current high-water mark of contempt for Scotland from Westminster concerns two Holyrood bills, which have cross-party support, incorporating the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Charter of Local Self-Government in Scottish Law. However, Holyroodrsquos competence is being challenged at the Supreme Court by our Secretary of State, Alister Jack, claiming: ldquoWhat [Holyrood] cannot do is seek to make provision that constrains the UK Parliamentrsquos ability to make laws for Scotland.As Ciaran Martin, a former constitution director at the Cabinet Office has pointed out, ldquothere are no limits to which Westminster can go to block Scottish independence, even on matters that Westminster agreed to devolve.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.* PETER A Russell takes me to task for failing to cite the setting up of the Smith Commission as the response of the UK Government to the Scottish independence referendum of . This was a completely inadequate response, but do not take my word for it.I refer Mr Russell to the article today by Andy Maciver, former Head of Communications for the Scottish Conservatives , and I quote an extract: ldquoUnionismrsquos response to the SNP winning the  election was the meek extra powers of the Calman commission its response to nearly losing the first referendum was the Smith Commission. Each time, Scotland wanted a slice of cake and was given a crumb.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.SEATS MAJORITY IS NOT ENOUGHIN  the SNP won  per cent of constituency votes and with the Greens accounted for % of list votes on a turnout of %. This time it seems likely that the turnout will be lower eventhe joint SNP plus Green vote exceeds % of those voting it seems highly likely that the votes in favour of parties backing another referendum will have the positive support of under % of the electorate. To my mind that is far too weak a base on which to build a huge constitutional change.I recall the  devolution referendum where the devolution effort was scuppered by the requirement to muster the support of % of the electorate. I thought that was unfair. But independence is a far bigger step than devolution. The idea that independence could be gained on the basis of a % plus  majority seems to me to very isive.Nicola Sturgeon has acknowledged that she needs to persuade a convincing majority of the Scottish electorate before she goes for another referendum. It is good that she says this, but it would be bettershe laid to rest the claim that a majority of seats in the new parliament,gained on a vote of well under a third of the electorate, represents an unanswerable democratic demand for a new referendum.Geoff Cohen, Edinburgh. YEARS FOR EU MEMBERSHIPIT may be acceptablefor the SNP to refuse to address questions surrounding the economic case for Scotland leaving the UK until it publishes its case in the run-up to a referendum.However, it tends to present Scotland in the UK and Scotland in Europe as though they were immediately-viable alternative outcomes. This is simply not the case.There would appear to be four sequential stages to Scotland becoming an independent country in the EU.The first stage covers the period from reaching agreement in principle with the UK Government about holding a referendum until that referendum takes place. For the  referendum this took . years.Then, following a vote in favour of Scotland leaving the UK, there would be a period of negotiation on the terms of the separation. The issues are much more complex than for Brexit, so it is hard to see that period being less than the . years that took.At this point Scotland becomes an independent country but outside the UK and outside the EU.To join the EU, Scotland must demonstrate that it has a properly ing market economy. This is very unlikely to be achieved until Scotland has a central bank controlling its own currency. The SNP Sustainable Growth Commission suggested that thiswould take  years, though other commentators consider this optimistic.Finally, the process of applying for EU membership, negotiating the terms and EU member states ratying that agreement can be expected to take four to five years.So in total, Scotland appears to be around  years away from EU membership.This would be a period of continued uncertainty and, with border friction affecting all international trade, it is hardly an environment to encourage investment.It would aid the debatethose in favour of seceding set out the timescale to achieving their objective of an independent Scotland within the EU and concede that there will be some very challenging economic issues to address to get from here to there.George Rennie, Inverness.GIVEAWAYS ARE UK-FUNDEDTHE SNP election manesto is a cornucopia of giveaways. Another pound billion for the Scottish National Investment Bank, free dental care, a pay rise for NHS staff, free laptops and bikes, bonds of up to pound, for families to remain in or move to underpopulated areashellip the list of monies to be spent is almost limitless. And in among them, a commitment not to raise income tax and to freeze LBTT. For a country already deep in deficit, how is this to be achieved Ah, the largesse of HM Treasury will pay for it.

A final Ipsos Mori poll for STV yesterday put the SNP on course to win  seats, but up to one-fth of likely voters also said they could yet change their minds.Emily Gray, managing director of Ipsos Mori Scotland, said: ldquoWhether there will be an SNP majority or not hangs in the balance.ldquoThe election result may come down to how the parties perform in a small number of key marginal seats, as well as the regional vote, which is likely to prove particularly important in determining which party is in second place.ldquoWith a relatively high percentage of voters still saying theyrsquove not definitely decided, all the parties still have something to play for.Professor Curtice also highlighted the importance of nine marginal seats currently held by the opposition parties, where the SNP need to make gains for a majority. Although the Unionist leads are small, tactical voting is already well-established in the seats, meaning the SNP will find them tougher to take on the ground than on paper.A YouGov poll for The Times also put support for independence down, at  per cent among decided voters, suggesting there may be a hardening of the anti-SNP vote. As all the parties embarked on a last frantic bout of campaigning, the most intense battle was among Unionists for regional list votes, as the SNP is so strong in constituencies.In her final message to voters, MsSturgeon stressed her experience through the pandemic.:What is Scotlandrsquos voting system and how does it dfer from UK electionsShe said: ldquoTodayrsquos election is the most important in the history of the Scottish Parliament. ldquoAfter a year of unprecedented challenge for all, the country needs experienced leadership to take Scotland through the pandemic ndash only the SNP are offering a serious programme for government to keep Scotland safe and into a recovery.ldquoPolls show that, when it comes to the balance of the new Parliament, the result is on a kne-edge.

Emma tells her story and explains why: “After achieving my Bronze and Silver Duke of Edinburgh Awardswithin the Cadets, I couldn’t wait to start to work towards my Gold. I chose netball as my sport and singing as my skill – two activities which I really enjoyed and will keep up. “The residential section of my DofE was run at Ballykinlerin County Down, but it involved Cadets from right across the UK. Together we took part in all sorts of outdoor activities and we earned leadership qualications. “As a bonus, when I completed that residential training, I discovered that I had been selected to represent the Army Cadet Force UK as the Queen’s Cadet at her th birthday beacon lighting at Windsor Castle. I would be walking by the Queens side representing Northern Ireland at the official birthday party in Windsor Castle!”AWARDSThe Queen’s th birthday was marked on st April  with a nationwide chain of beacons when Her Majesty lit the first beacon at Windsor Castle Great Park accompanied by members of the Royal Family including the Duke of Edinburgh. The event was heavily televised and with lots of media coverage.“On that day the Duke was speaking to myself and another RAF cadet. He asked us bothwe had done the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme  “I replied that I had, it was one of the reasons I was here whilst the other cadet truthfully said he had not. The Duke of Edinburgh responded by saying I was now his favourite cadet!“It was one of the best experiences of my le and meeting HM the Queen and HRH Duke of Edinburgh issomething I will never forget and would never have achievedit were not for the Army Cadet Force.“As a Cadet I gained many qualications and had many great experiences - which included a six week Canadian exchange. This all proved incredibly useful when I was compiling my personal statement when applying to universities.” Emmalee was presented her Gold Duke of Edinburgh Award at St James Palace, London.Congratulating her at the time the Colonel Adrian Donaldson, Commandant of stBattalion Army Cadet Force, said:“Emmalee put a huge amount into the ACF and it was a pleasure to have such a great asset in the Detachment.

However,they are given on a daily basis they are no longer ‘treats’ they are part of the child’s diet and can then contribute to long-term health risks,” he said.The new campaign is already winning support from parents, with % saying treat-eating is the behaviour they most want to improve upon.“This past year has not been easy for parents and has had a signicant, negative impact on what we eat and how active we are as families,” said Joana da Silva, chief specialist in Human Health and Nutrition at Safefood.“But as measures are slowly being eased, it brings the hope that parents can restart those healthy habits at home for all the family.”David Tumulty from the Public Health Agency added: “By having fewer treats available in your home and offering healthier snacks, this makes it easier to bridge the gap between wanting to do the right thing and feeling we have to give in.”Charlene Brooks, boss of Parenting NI said the START  stepsshould help parents and families get back on track.- Avoid the treat aisle in the supermarket when shopping —they aren’t at home it reduces temptation.- Get the children involved in planning healthy snacks. Start a family challenge  Star chart to increase your fruit and vegetable intake.- Use non-food treats, such as a trip to a new children’s playground or to the beach.- Make healthy swaps. Offer crackers and cheese instead of chocolate biscuits, choose plain popcorn or breadsticks instead of crisps, offer a low fat yogurt or fruit straight after school instead of a chocolate bar.- Celebrate success.

There is no sign that a similarly comprehensive blueprint is on the horizon from nationalists here.Our poll indicates that the strongest argument unionists could employ is that Irish unity would hit people in their pockets on both sides of the border.More than half in Northern Ireland think they#d be worse off with just % believing they#d prosper. But % of people were unsure, meaning that the economic arguments on both sides really need to be formed and aired.!fordocument.querySelectortIn the Republic, four in  thought they#d be worse off in a united Ireland, one in five disagreed, and a staggering % didn#t know. If RTE hasn#t already planned it, another Claire Byrne Live to shed light on this part of the debate would be warmly welcomed.A majority on both sides of the border said they wouldn#t be prepared to pay more taxes to fund Irish unity.!fordocument.querySelectortNorthern Ireland currently receives a £bn annual subvention from Westminster. Almost half of people in the Republic said they#d match thator pay some of it . A third were totally opposed to doing so.But the £bn figure is disputed. It#s the UK statistical calculation that encompasses costs which nationalists believe wouldn#t transfer to a new united Ireland. Those costs include UK government debt interest, contributions to the UK armed forces and pension liabilities.!fordocument.querySelectortStill, Northern Ireland#s low cost of living and high number of public sector jobs will be extremely successful weaponsunionists are forced to do battle in a border poll.The jewel in the crown will of course be the NHS. Six in  voters here would be uncomfortable about transferring to the Republic#s health service.Changing it to a system similar to the NHS with free access and no prescription charges would surely be essential for nationalists in a future referendum. The British Treasury footing the bill during the pandemic for the furlough scheme also gives unionists strong ammunition.However, nationalists will be able to use Northern Ireland#s poor infrastructure, low wages, and very small private sector in their arguments. They will also suggest that considerable economic opportunities and potential investment could open up in the event of Irish unity.This poll gives Irish unity campaigners many reasons to pause for thought. Yet it also counters claims made by those who oppose constitutional change. The idea that the south doesn#t want the north is contradicted.More than two-thirds of people in the Republic support Irish unity with just % against.In Northern Ireland, there was a clear pro-Union lead - % to %, with % undecided.Some % of people here want a border poll compared to % opposed in the Republic two-thirds want one. Among referendum supporters, seven in  on both sides of the border want one now or within five years. Those figures suggest that the Taoiseach, who has dragged his feet on the issue and ruled out a border poll in coming years, is out of step with voters.The th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement in  is the date many nationalists are now speaking of for a referendum.The economic recovery of both the UK and the Republic post-pandemic will be key to the unity debate. If one state fares remarkably better than the other that will sway a signicant amount of Northern Ireland voters.Belfast Most ReadBobby Sands burial wishes ignored in favour of ‘political beneficial’ Belfast funeral‘Tough loss’ for Belfast as Holohans at the Barge restaurant announces closureFormer Fermanagh businessman James Balmer  charged with historical sexual abuseRevealed: the BBC NI presenters paid the most for external workAstonishing antics of NI hospital medic revealed: Doctor Tsakov admits to lewd and racist outbursts and showing porn to colleaguesTop VideosPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayPro-united Ireland poster removed from Divis Tower in Belfast PlayTrial of two veterans accused of IRA leader murder collapsesLatest The CentenaryThree young voices... why I feel Northern Irish, why I feel British and why I feel IrishCentenary poll: Public ided on terror amnesties as pardons for terrorists and troops leave people tornSuzanne BreenOpinionNorthern Ireland#s a powderkeg... but will of people must always prevailCentenary poll: #Irish unity would jeopardise peace in Northern Ireland# - survey confirms hardening of views in unionist communityCentenary poll: People from NI more likely to cross Irish border than southern counterparts LatestLiam BeckettOpinionPortadown striker Lee Bonis proves that the magic of the Irish League is still alive and wellServices firms boosted by pent-up demand as lockdown ltsHolidaymakers offered £ Covid testsMissing Lurgan schoolboy found ‘safe and well’Nearly just isn#t good enough for Linfield#s league title hopes, warns David Healy,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Those who favour a united Ireland have responded in a number of ways to this situation:Deny the figures - yes, about £bn of the transfer is an attributing to NI of spending done by the UK central government . But, in a united Ireland surely some of such spending would continue Claim taxes could rise - they could, but, as this poll shows, there would be considerable opposition to that, especially in the Republic.Claim public spending in NI could be scaled back - it is one thing to argue our public sector is too large in relative terms, but any sudden adjustment would probably provoke a major recession. Claim a united Ireland could out-grow the problem - true, in recent years the Republic#s economic growth rate has surpassed that in NI, even discounting the tax-avoiding behaviour of multinationals, but can we really assume that unity per se would have a sudden transformative impact on NI#s economic performance Claim that the Dublin government could borrow to keep NI afloat - at the moment, interest rates are very low, but that won#t always be true.Argue that the UK Government would leave its cheque book behind - in the s, the London government wrote off the Irish Free State#s obligation for part of the UK#s public debt, but can we really imagine a UK government being so generous as to wipe out debt and continue to pay for some welfare benefitsand subsidise NI#s infrastructure To be fair, this existence of the big fiscal deficit is also problematic for unionists. They could claim other UK regions have deficits. They do, but none are so large. They could try to argue this is a form of UK solidarity payment, but will that really wash with taxpayers in south-east England The biggest danger is that a long-term dependency on subsidy from Great Britain has actually distorted economic behaviour. As RHI exemplied, free money trumps making necessary reforms.One particularly interesting area of Northern Ireland-Republic comparisons is healthcare: a major focus of the Kantar Belfastpoll.The south uses a mixture of state provision and private insurance. The polling response shows a very strong preferences in NI to continue with the NHS model. That said, the advantages of free at the point of use are blunted by our ening waiting lists.OECD data implies healthcare spending per person in the Republic now exceeds that in NI and the UK average.Of course, as indicated by US experience, very high spending does not necessarily bring better quality. We know the dference in Covid vaccination rates.To finish with a health analogy, for all its points of strength, the NI economy remains in need of intensive care - a period of recuperation, rather than a major constitutional shock is probably the priority.Dr Esmond Birnie is senior economist at Ulster UniversityBelfast Most ReadBobby Sands burial wishes ignored in favour of ‘political beneficial’ Belfast funeral‘Tough loss’ for Belfast as Holohans at the Barge restaurant announces closureFormer Fermanagh businessman James Balmer  charged with historical sexual abuseAstonishing antics of NI hospital medic revealed: Doctor Tsakov admits to lewd and racist outbursts and showing porn to colleaguesRevealed: the BBC NI presenters paid the most for external workTop VideosPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlayPro-united Ireland poster removed from Divis Tower in Belfast PlayTrial of two veterans accused of IRA leader murder collapsesLatest The CentenaryThree young voices... why I feel Northern Irish, why I feel British and why I feel IrishCentenary poll: Public ided on terror amnesties as pardons for terrorists and troops leave people tornSuzanne BreenOpinionNorthern Ireland#s a powderkeg... but will of people must always prevailCentenary poll: #Irish unity would jeopardise peace in Northern Ireland# - survey confirms hardening of views in unionist communityCentenary poll: People from NI more likely to cross Irish border than southern counterparts LatestGlentoran have made path to Europe all the harder after ‘bad four days’, says MillarLiam BeckettOpinionPortadown striker Lee Bonis proves that the magic of the Irish League is still alive and wellBlack adults aged -plus least likely to have received Covid jabServices firms boosted by pent-up demand as lockdown ltsHolidaymakers offered £ Covid tests,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He outlined plans for a unionist convention ahead of next year#s election to maximise unionist representation.Read MorePoots vs Donaldson: Tale of the tape as DUP heavyweights square off for party leadership Read MoreNelson McCausland:OpinionDUP must recover its passion... and new leader has to deliverThe Agriculture Minister promised an extensive outreach programme across unionism and loyalism to address issues of marginalisation, disadvantage and to rebuild communities. He said that he would set up a pro-Union think-tank including civic and political figures to broaden support for the Union to avoid a border poll.He would engage in international outreach to better explain the unionist cause in Brussels, London and North America. Mr Poots confirmed that he would split the positions of DUP leader and First Minister as one person simply cannot do justice to both demanding jobs. Instead of acting as First Minister, he would oversee the work of a new ministerial team and the day-to-day running of the party. Vowing to transform it totally, he said he would put democracy back into the Democratic Unionist Party.He pledged to order an independent review of the DUP with a view to creating a new, fit-for-purpose modern political party. He also announced plans to reach out to the grassroots of the party and to attract new members.The Agriculture Minister, who is expected to remain in that posthe becomes leader, said he wanted to ensure the effective running of the Executive through constructive engagement, but he would challenge republican propaganda and shameless populism”.He said he would lead a campaign against the “undemocratic protocol”. He also pledged to bridge the gap, and ensure “effective collaboration”, between DUP representatives in the Assembly and at Westminster in all policy areas.Meanwhile, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill has said she felt sorry for Arlene Foster over the way she was treated by her party colleagues. She repeated her view that misogyny played a part in the internal DUP revolt that forced Mrs Foster to resign as DUP leader. Ms O#Neill would not be drawn on who she would prefer to win the leadership contest between Edwin Poots and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.However, she said her relationship with whoever emerged victorious had to be one that was based on mutual respect and delivering outstanding political commitments from the New Decade, New Approach deal to restore powersharing at Stormont, including Irish language legislation.She said: I am joint head of government, I want to work with the leader of unionism but that needs to be on the basis of mutual respect, it needs to be on the basis of delivering political commitments that have been made.We had three years of hiatus, we had a political agreement in New Decade, New Approach. There are many outstanding commitments that haven#t been delivered, some because of Covid, some because there hasn#t been a full agreement to deliver in terms timeframe.

The commission is a very progressive body and hearing a range of perspectives will be invaluable.There is so much work to do. If there’s a future referendum, people need to know what sort of Ireland they’re voting for.”Dr Hamilton said: “I am delighted that the SDLP have reached out beyond the usual political activists to people of faith like me. I didn’t hesitate for a second in agreeing to come on board.I will be sitting on the commission as a Christian minister, and not as an armchair politician.”Dr Hamilton said he would “be surprised”he didn’t face criticism for joining the commission. “Some people will struggle to understand why a former Presbyterian moderator would want to be part of a discussion on Irish unity,” he said.“It’s important to remember that Presbyterians weren’t always unionists. It may seem strange, and a bit unpalatable now, but historically Presbyterians have been on both sides of the constitutional question here. The United Irishmen were radical Presbyterians.”Askedhe was a unionist or a nationalist, the former moderator said: “The unionism I come from is being changed by what is happening in London and Edinburgh. The underpinnings of the Union are being challenged by a rising English nationalism.

All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Loughshore Lingo, by poet and writer Antaacuten Oacute Daacutela an Riacute, contains more than  alphabetical entries documenting the unique phrases and sayings of Lough Neaghs western shores. A series of  local stories are also included in the book, which gives a flavour of the areas native wit and ability to find humour in all situations. Originally from Killetra, near The Loup, Oacute Daacutela an Riacute said the book is a unique linguistic record. “This essential book will be a godsend for anyone intending to visit this famed region, just a good stretch a the legs from the City of Derry,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “It may also cause those from the area covered to scratch their heads in disbelief at the way they speak to one another, but carry on regardless with a wry smile. “In a world of increasing homogenization, Loughshore Lingo will stand as a valuable and detailed record of the lingual idiosyncrasies to be found in one small part of Ulster. “It might also make you laugh until you cry, and hiccup until you eventually pass out.” Ballinderry is one of the Loughshore villages on which the book centres. The following is an extract from one of the books many tales A Toast to Eternal Rest. googletag.cmd.push “Two local wags were carefully navigating their way home after closing time having enjoyed the free-flowing hospitality of a neighbouring licensed premises,” it reads. “With a thirst for more drink upon them, they approached the darkened form of the parish pub, above which resided the sleeping proprietor and his family. “After throwing stones at his bedroom window, the two managed to waken the weary innkeeper. “We just wanted to tell you that poor John James has gone to his rest, they exclaimed with grief-laden voices. “The landlord expressed shock and dismay at such a turn of events and immediately rushed downstairs, whereupon he admitted the messengers and set them up a whiskey each.     “After a few respectable minutes of quiet reflection the pub owner decided to tackle the elephant in the room. “So, when did John James die  he tenderly enquired. “Die , said one, We never said he was dead, only that hed gone to his rest. He went to bed about an hour ago. “They didnt get to finish their drinks.” Loughshore Lingo is available to purchase on eBay, Facebook Marketplace and via the online shop of Rebel Voice magazine, priced at pound..  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His daughter and SDLP Causeway Coast and Glens councillor, Helena Dallat OrsquoDriscoll, reflects on the past year.Just weeks before my fathers passing, with the COVID death toll rising, Northern Ireland had entered lockdown in a bid to limit the spread of coronavirus. The Health Minister, Robin Swann, had described the potential scale of the impending surge as being of biblical proportions and for the next year, people would live a new normal - no unnecessary journeys, no mixing with other households, working from homepossible and many other restrictions on daily le. Two days after the announcement of the restrictions, we were hit with the news that my father’s cancer treatment had met an unexpected twist and he had weeks to live. googletag.cmd.push Like many families in Northern Ireland, we were to care for and say goodbye to a loved one in lockdown. It is hard to believe that a year has passed since dad died, in some ways time has stood still. I think most families bereaved in the last year will be experiencing a similar feeling. A lack of closure comes with a lockdown death, especiallyrestrictions were at their height. Although a small number of us were privileged to be with dad at the moment he died, we missed the rituals that we had all come to expect as normal. googletag.cmd.push As a society, we have such a respect for the dead and the bereaved, regardless of culture or faith but COVID upended all those customs and comforting gestures. As was the case for many families, we had no wake and we were unable to keep his remains at home. We didn’t carry his coffin. The church was almost empty for his funeral. The only physical touch at his graveside was from our very immediate family. From that moment, I realised that, even as a mum of two tactile daughters, I had totally underestimated physical touch and how it comforts and modulates emotions.     Having no visitors in the months following a death also adds to the feeling of isolation and I have felt particularly for those who might be living in remote areas or who don’t have their families close by.  All things considered, we were one of the luckier families. Although there was a feeling of isolation and loneliness due to the restrictions, at least the conditions were sufficiently safe for us to be with dad at the end. Thanks to first-class medical care from his consultant, our GPs, district nurses, carers and our NI Hospice community hospice nurse, we were able to care for him at home. Our community hospice nurse, in particular, taught us invaluable lessons. We quickly learned about symptom assessment and pain relief but also the preciousness of le and how to let someone with so precious little time left live as fully as possible until the end. He also died with nothing important left unsaid. Many other families never got a chance to nurse or say goodbye to their loved ones because of COVID circumstances and I find that unimaginably heartbreaking. It was a first lesson in just how vital our hospice services are. However, despite their critical nature, their futures are frequently faced with uncertainty. The demands on our palliative and end-of-le care services are steadily increasing but funding has not kept pace. The present funding methodology is flawed and operates without evidence base or up-to-date benchmarks. Last week at Stormont, cross-party support was achieved for the inclusion of death, dying and bereavement in the Programme for Government and I very much welcome that. It is progress but we have a long way to go. We need to give much more sustainable support to our end-of-le care providers. We must not forget that these organisations are lting the burden from the NHS which is why core funding is so important. Given the exceptional nature of this year, there is also a need for additional mental health resources to help deal with COVID’s psychological toll, especially for those grieving in our rural areas and those who have a limited network of support. This pandemic has reminded us that palliative and end-of-le care is a vitally important part of our care system and I believe it has opened up an important conversation around dying and bereavement.  Grief is a normal, albeit sad and challenging, part of le. We will all experience the pain of losing a loved one at some point. However, I believe there is no doubt that the current pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to the grieving process, setting the stage for more complex and prolonged reactions for many who have lost loved ones. My SDLP colleagues and I will continue to press for more sustainable provision for the dying and bereaved and call for urgent, additional resources to tackle the poor mental health some of our bereaved families are likely to suffer as a result of loss in what have been traumatic conditions.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His daughter and SDLP Causeway Coast and Glens councillor, Helena Dallat OrsquoDriscoll, reflects on the past year.Just weeks before my fathers passing, with the COVID death toll rising, Northern Ireland had entered lockdown in a bid to limit the spread of coronavirus. The Health Minister, Robin Swann, had described the potential scale of the impending surge as being of biblical proportions and for the next year, people would live a new normal - no unnecessary journeys, no mixing with other households, working from homepossible and many other restrictions on daily le. Two days after the announcement of the restrictions, we were hit with the news that my father’s cancer treatment had met an unexpected twist and he had weeks to live. googletag.cmd.push Like many families in Northern Ireland, we were to care for and say goodbye to a loved one in lockdown. It is hard to believe that a year has passed since dad died, in some ways time has stood still. I think most families bereaved in the last year will be experiencing a similar feeling. A lack of closure comes with a lockdown death, especiallyrestrictions were at their height. Although a small number of us were privileged to be with dad at the moment he died, we missed the rituals that we had all come to expect as normal. googletag.cmd.push As a society, we have such a respect for the dead and the bereaved, regardless of culture or faith but COVID upended all those customs and comforting gestures. As was the case for many families, we had no wake and we were unable to keep his remains at home. We didn’t carry his coffin. The church was almost empty for his funeral. The only physical touch at his graveside was from our very immediate family. From that moment, I realised that, even as a mum of two tactile daughters, I had totally underestimated physical touch and how it comforts and modulates emotions.     Having no visitors in the months following a death also adds to the feeling of isolation and I have felt particularly for those who might be living in remote areas or who don’t have their families close by.  All things considered, we were one of the luckier families. Although there was a feeling of isolation and loneliness due to the restrictions, at least the conditions were sufficiently safe for us to be with dad at the end. Thanks to first-class medical care from his consultant, our GPs, district nurses, carers and our NI Hospice community hospice nurse, we were able to care for him at home. Our community hospice nurse, in particular, taught us invaluable lessons. We quickly learned about symptom assessment and pain relief but also the preciousness of le and how to let someone with so precious little time left live as fully as possible until the end. He also died with nothing important left unsaid. Many other families never got a chance to nurse or say goodbye to their loved ones because of COVID circumstances and I find that unimaginably heartbreaking. It was a first lesson in just how vital our hospice services are. However, despite their critical nature, their futures are frequently faced with uncertainty. The demands on our palliative and end-of-le care services are steadily increasing but funding has not kept pace. The present funding methodology is flawed and operates without evidence base or up-to-date benchmarks. Last week at Stormont, cross-party support was achieved for the inclusion of death, dying and bereavement in the Programme for Government and I very much welcome that. It is progress but we have a long way to go. We need to give much more sustainable support to our end-of-le care providers. We must not forget that these organisations are lting the burden from the NHS which is why core funding is so important. Given the exceptional nature of this year, there is also a need for additional mental health resources to help deal with COVID’s psychological toll, especially for those grieving in our rural areas and those who have a limited network of support. This pandemic has reminded us that palliative and end-of-le care is a vitally important part of our care system and I believe it has opened up an important conversation around dying and bereavement.  Grief is a normal, albeit sad and challenging, part of le. We will all experience the pain of losing a loved one at some point. However, I believe there is no doubt that the current pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to the grieving process, setting the stage for more complex and prolonged reactions for many who have lost loved ones. My SDLP colleagues and I will continue to press for more sustainable provision for the dying and bereaved and call for urgent, additional resources to tackle the poor mental health some of our bereaved families are likely to suffer as a result of loss in what have been traumatic conditions.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The guidelines, spread over two documents, offer bespoke advice depending on the category of care setting involved. “I fully recognise the importance of visiting for those who are receiving care. I hope this guidance will be widely welcomed, said Mr Swann. “It is also important to remember that the threat from COVID- remains very real. Everyone has a vital role to play when it comes to safe visiting. That includes social distancing, hand hygiene and not visitingyou are feeling unwell yourself.      Visiting was only ever restricted because it was absolutely necessary to do so to protect patients and residents from the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV- virus and subsequent development of COVID- infection. Given the progress that has been made against the virus, the time is now right to take steps to carefully re-introduce visiting. I welcome the work completed to draw up these updated guidance documents and hope that by implementing them we will take another step along the road to recovery.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The bars had been planning to open for outdoor eating and drinking as part of the latest easing of Covid- restrictions. However, they have now been told that they cannot reopen due to guidelines what constitutes an outdoor space. The Department of Health said the general rule of thumb is that outdoor premises should not be more than % enclosed. The definition of enclosed and substantially enclosed comes from the smoke-free legislation from  and is directly referenced in the restriction regulations, a spokesperson said. This was the same definition that was in place since last July and is not part of the recent amendments which will allow outdoor hospitality to open from  April. googletag.cmd.push Among the local pubs impacted are the Magnet Bar at Culmore, Molly Malones in Ballymagroarty and the Happy Landing in Eglinton. They have had to inform customers that they will not be able honour bookings made for Friday. These pubs will now have to wait until May  when indoor bars will be allowed to reopen. Colin Neill, the chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said the interpretation of regulations was far too stringent. The idea of outdoor [hospitality] being opened again is meaninglessonly a relatively small number of venues can actually make it work, he said. Many will have prepared for reopening by buying thousands of pounds worth of stock to replenish their empty bars, only to be told that their set up does not meet the regulations, despite being open to the same standard in previous failed reopening phases. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This marks the latest stage of the easing of the coronavirus restrictions. Hospitality businesses can also reopen but must only operate outdoors, with table service and limited numbers per table. Gyms and swimming pools, including those based in leisure centres, can only open for inidual training or for one-to-one coaching with a personal trainer. Restrictions on meeting up outside have also been slightly further eased, with  people from three households allowed to meet in a private garden. Earlier closing times for takeaway businesses and off-licences have also been removed. googletag.cmd.push Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr BrianTierney, has asked the public to support local businesses as more prepare to reopen today. He said that it has been an incredibly challenging year for so many businesses within the district, and he asked that the public do what they can to support them while also adhering to health guidelines. I know there will be many businesses across our city and district really excited to open their doors today after a turbulent and dficult past year. I hope that everyone will support those businesses in the weeks and months ahead as they try toto normality, said MayorTierney. googletag.cmd.push In doing so, I would ask everyone to please make sure theyre following the health guidelines in place including wearing a face mask where required and always maintaining social distancing. It really is brilliant to see businesses reopen, but we also have to be mindful that the COVID- virus is still in our community so the best way that we can help our local businesses is by following the guidelines while in stores and out and about.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In March , Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee refusedClanmil Housing Association permission to build a four-storey complex comprised of  apartments at Victoria Road. However, Clanmil appealed the decision and it has now been overturned. Local planning officers had described the location as ‘possibly the most dficult regeneration site’ in the city. However, the officers had recommended that councillors approve the application for the Victoria Road apartments as the application was ‘entirely compliant’. In their report, planning officers stated that they believed it would reinvigorate the riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. googletag.cmd.push  Among the objections raised by councillors had been that there was no parking provided within the plans for the Victoria Road apartments. At the meeting in March , local councillors said they believed a parking ban ‘discriminated’ against people with disabilities. At last year’s meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group said the apartment complex design looked like a ‘horric brutalist East German style eyesore’. Mr Hegarty said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in ‘hazardous parking’ on Victoria Road and he envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. googletag.cmd.push In response, a representative for Clanmil said it is a ‘highly accessible’ location with bus stops and train travel nearby. The housing association claimed that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. A report by the Planning Appeals Commission into the matter has now found that the objections were not sustained and overturned the decision to refuse planning permission. The decision to overturn the councils refusal decision has been criticised by local rail campaigners, Into the West. The land at Victoria Road was previously part of the Derry to Strabane railway line which closed in .     Into the West has been campaigning for the line to be reopened and they have described the decision to allow the apartment complex to be built on the site as a disaster. A building there will make it impossible to restore a railway line along that route in future – making it extremely unlikely we will ever see rail from Derry to Strabane or Letterkenny again, said Steve Bradley, chair of Into the West. Without a route to Strabane, there can be no direct rail services form Derry or Donegal to Dublin. And as Derry has a bigger population than every other town on the former Derry-Portadown rail route,our city can no longer be included in that proposed reopening then the viability of restoring rail to places like Omagh, Strabane, Enniskillen, Dungannon and Letterkenny also collapses. In short – building  apartments in that location will destroy any future for rail across the west of Ulster and prevent it being ed to Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh.

Planning officers have recommended refusing planning permission for the  new apartments within a six-storey building on a vacant plot on Northland Road between Clarence Avenue and the Magee campus of Ulster University. However, the final decision on the proposal rests with councillors on Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee.

Dr Glynn said he is hopeful that additional measures will not be required for the county in the coming weeks and he is confident that the situation in Donegal will improve quickly. He was speaking at a press briefing for the media in Donegal on Wednesday following the fallout from comments made by chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan last Friday about the high incidence of Covid- in the county. googletag.cmd.push There has been a backlash in Donegal to the tone of the comments Dr Holohan made when he said there were concerns about things happening in the county that “even the dogs on the street” know shouldn’t be happening. Figures released at the press briefing put the national incidence rate in the county at  cases per , people compared to a national rate of . The highest rates are in the Milford local electoral area at . and the Letterkenny area where the rate is .. The lowest rate in the county is in the Donegal LEA at .. The briefing was told there were  GP referrals for testing in the county on Tuesday, an increase of % on the same day last week. googletag.cmd.push Dr Glynn said the concerns were raised last week so that people can take protective measures and ensure the situation does not get worse. He said there is a bigger number of smaller clusters in Donegal than in other parts of the country. “It was not meant as blame. It certainly was not made as a threat,” he said. “It would be very strange for us to preside over a situation where incidence is very high and increasing in a county and not draw attention to that.” At the briefing, director of public health for the HSE in the north-west, Dr Anthony Breslin, highlighted a number of clusters that have occurred due to events in the county in recent weeks, including awake, a family gathering and an th birthday party.     The events resulted in dozens of cases and infections in workplaces, in families and at a school. One social gathering has been linked to  cases of Covid-, he said. Dr Glynn said that there are concerns about the situation in the county and that some people in Donegal have “pushed the boundaries”. “We are concerned about the current incidence. That is not to say that Donegal has not come a very long way over the past number of months, just as the rest of the country has, and that can only have happened because the majority of people are trying to do the right thing,” he said. “This is not in any way a reflection on the majority but clearly there are a number of incidents where people have pushed the boundaries. “We have seen that in other counties, it is not just in Donegal. But I suppose the dference at the moment versus some other places where we have particularly high incidences, is that there are large clusters driving incidences. “In Donegal, it seems to be a little bit more widespread with a bigger number of smaller clusters which makes it that little bit harder to control. Sowe can continue to emphasise, andwe can get people who have been pushing the boundaries a little bit just to comply that bit more over the coming weeks, we should see incidence drop quickly in Donegal.” He said we can not get away from the fact that the high incidence rates in parts of the county are due to the fact the disease is being transmitted from person to person. “It gets transmitted from person to person when people come into contact with one another and when for whatever reason masks are not worn, distance is not kept, people who are symptomatic don’t self-isolate. “Right now we are seeing a higher incidence in Donegal than we have in other parts of the country and in that regard, it is incumbent on us as doctors to point out our concerns so that people can take proactive actions because there are many people who remain very vulnerable to this disease over the coming weeks,” he said. “All we are asking people in Donegal to do is to protect themselves and their families. We are not proposing any dferent measures for any one part of Donegal as things currently stand, and I would be hopeful and optimistic given the level of engagement over the past number of days that we wont be looking at some sort of additional measures for the county or any part of the county over the coming weeks.” He said the priority for people over the coming weeks is to meet people outside. “As far as is possible at all, do not meet up with friends or extended families or do not have parties inside. Inside gives this virus such an advantage in terms of transmission,” he said. “Last January Donegal had an incidence of , per ,. It is now  per ,. It is the highest in the country but it’s an order of magnitude lower than where it was and that’s down to the work of the majority doing most of the right things most of the time.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dr Glynn said he is hopeful that additional measures will not be required for the county in the coming weeks and he is confident that the situation in Donegal will improve quickly. He was speaking at a press briefing for the media in Donegal on Wednesday following the fallout from comments made by chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan last Friday about the high incidence of Covid- in the county. googletag.cmd.push There has been a backlash in Donegal to the tone of the comments Dr Holohan made when he said there were concerns about things happening in the county that “even the dogs on the street” know shouldn’t be happening. Figures released at the press briefing put the national incidence rate in the county at  cases per , people compared to a national rate of . The highest rates are in the Milford local electoral area at . and the Letterkenny area where the rate is .. The lowest rate in the county is in the Donegal LEA at .. The briefing was told there were  GP referrals for testing in the county on Tuesday, an increase of % on the same day last week. googletag.cmd.push Dr Glynn said the concerns were raised last week so that people can take protective measures and ensure the situation does not get worse. He said there is a bigger number of smaller clusters in Donegal than in other parts of the country. “It was not meant as blame. It certainly was not made as a threat,” he said. “It would be very strange for us to preside over a situation where incidence is very high and increasing in a county and not draw attention to that.” At the briefing, director of public health for the HSE in the north-west, Dr Anthony Breslin, highlighted a number of clusters that have occurred due to events in the county in recent weeks, including awake, a family gathering and an th birthday party.     The events resulted in dozens of cases and infections in workplaces, in families and at a school. One social gathering has been linked to  cases of Covid-, he said. Dr Glynn said that there are concerns about the situation in the county and that some people in Donegal have “pushed the boundaries”. “We are concerned about the current incidence. That is not to say that Donegal has not come a very long way over the past number of months, just as the rest of the country has, and that can only have happened because the majority of people are trying to do the right thing,” he said. “This is not in any way a reflection on the majority but clearly there are a number of incidents where people have pushed the boundaries. “We have seen that in other counties, it is not just in Donegal. But I suppose the dference at the moment versus some other places where we have particularly high incidences, is that there are large clusters driving incidences. “In Donegal, it seems to be a little bit more widespread with a bigger number of smaller clusters which makes it that little bit harder to control. Sowe can continue to emphasise, andwe can get people who have been pushing the boundaries a little bit just to comply that bit more over the coming weeks, we should see incidence drop quickly in Donegal.” He said we can not get away from the fact that the high incidence rates in parts of the county are due to the fact the disease is being transmitted from person to person. “It gets transmitted from person to person when people come into contact with one another and when for whatever reason masks are not worn, distance is not kept, people who are symptomatic don’t self-isolate. “Right now we are seeing a higher incidence in Donegal than we have in other parts of the country and in that regard, it is incumbent on us as doctors to point out our concerns so that people can take proactive actions because there are many people who remain very vulnerable to this disease over the coming weeks,” he said. “All we are asking people in Donegal to do is to protect themselves and their families. We are not proposing any dferent measures for any one part of Donegal as things currently stand, and I would be hopeful and optimistic given the level of engagement over the past number of days that we wont be looking at some sort of additional measures for the county or any part of the county over the coming weeks.” He said the priority for people over the coming weeks is to meet people outside. “As far as is possible at all, do not meet up with friends or extended families or do not have parties inside. Inside gives this virus such an advantage in terms of transmission,” he said. “Last January Donegal had an incidence of , per ,. It is now  per ,. It is the highest in the country but it’s an order of magnitude lower than where it was and that’s down to the work of the majority doing most of the right things most of the time.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

While a student in St Patricks Maghera, she played on the schools first Ladies Gaelic Football team. She is a walking advocate for ladies sport, getting involved and trying to promote it.There is no hiding her enthusiasm. A break from her studies to talk all things football lts the lid on her sporting knowledge and an obvious passion for the exciting developments at Draperstown Celtic.“Sport is great, not just for the physical aspect, but there are the mental health benefits too,” explains Niamh.Student le in Belfast gave her an opportunity to try her hand at soccer with Queens, something she had longed to do. A grand-daughter of former Draperstown Celtic player Malachy McGuigan, Niamh qualied as a Level  coach in the autumn and is now coaching the underage players in the clubs Diamonds Ladies team and is part of the recently formed senior team. googletag.cmd.push Niamh, back row second from right, pictured before a QUB game. Her placement has already been secured in the Dublin branch of international pharmaceutical giants Alexion secured for next year. Sunday mornings are the perfect getaway from the stresses of revision.“I even had an exam on a Monday and I went to DC on Sunday, the buzz you get ,lts your mood so much...that escape from everything ,” Niamh points out.Her camogie career took her up the underage ranks to senior level. An injury forced her out of action and with her A-Levels on the horizon, study took preference.With no soccer clubs on her doorstep, travelling to Cookstown-based Mid Ulster Ladies wasnt feasible.“It was a great team and they were lovely there, but I just couldnt balance it,” Niamh adds. “Now I have got involved with DC, it is only down the road and my Granny and Granda live in Draperstown.”It wasnt until the age of  that she began her soccer career with Queens.“I just thought I have the opportunity now to start something I wanted, I joined their team in  and I havent looked back since,” Niamh points out.“Every evening, you were looking forward to training. You make friends for le and it is such a great sport.”When Chairman Paul McCallion floated the idea of a ladies team in Draperstown, she jumped at the chance. There was no second thought required.“I want to give the younger ones the opportunity from that age to be able to play football instead of waiting until they are . The atmosphere around DC, you couldnt get nicer people,” Niamh enthused. googletag.cmd.push COACHING Despite having her coaching qualication tucked away, the sporting lockdown kept her itching to get started. Enthusiasm morphed into frustration.“I was raging because there was no sport and I wanted to get straight out into it,” Niamh adds.“For me, coaching is so rewarding. Even when you are taking the session, at the start the players are a bit timid, but by the end of the session, especially the young ones, you can see how much they have progressed. For me, that gives me a real buzz.”“They are playing with their own age group,with girls. Through the years, theyll build a team with each other. “I have learned so much from the last two years, so imagine young girls learning the game from a young age. The love of the game and even building a team with each other.”In her younger days, she remembers her Granda Malachy taking her to the St Colms Draperstown school and Ballinascreen camogie teams he was involved in. There is a photo doing the rounds of a young Niamh, as a mascot, perched at the front of a team photo.Niamhs love for soccer came from watching the US womens national team and their promotion of the game. The Los Angeles based Angel City team, starting up in , will be the th team in the National Womens Soccer League.     Tobin Heath inspired Niamhs interest in football.  “When you look at the US team, they are a successful team with big players like Tobin Heath. She is such somebody I would look towards,” Niamh adds.Her engineering background comes to the fore as she number crunches the rise of the game. The most watched game, the USAs - win over Holland in the  World Cup Final had an increase of  percent in just four years.Add in the Northern Ireland ladies qualication for a first ever European Womens Championships. Local heroes. Niamh was starstruck when Northern Ireland ladies captain Marissa Callaghan came to DC Diamonds first senior session recently.“Those are the types of people, idols youd want to be, those you see on the TV,” Niamh said, while remembering some of the advice.“Marissa told us to aim to play on the Northern Ireland team. It is about having expectations and always wanting to better yourself....dont doubt yourself.”The first session brought excitement. Others have declared an interest in joining the senior squad, coached by Chloe McPeake and Alice Bradley. Niamh will also weigh in with a helping hand.“It was such a great session, they had it down to a tee,” Niamh stated. “It was a fun session, we played a fun and competitive game. There is a balance, it is recreational and there is a chance to play more seriously.”Niamh urges others to come along. The door is open to everyone.“I have made friends for le, people from America and England and just down the road,” she concludes of her soccer involvement so far.“Even the confidence you get from being on a team, you build so much as a person and you are out there getting fit. It is a great release.“It is a bit of fun and it can be competitiveyou want. It is about getting out there, enjoying the game, the great game that it is.” The Draperstown Celtic Senior Diamonds train every Sunday morning at .am at the Back Row G pitch in Draperstown.

Sunday mornings are the perfect getaway from the stresses of revision.“I even had an exam on a Monday and I went to DC on Sunday, the buzz you get ,lts your mood so much...that escape from everything ,” Niamh points out.Her camogie career took her up the underage ranks to senior level. An injury forced her out of action and with her A-Levels on the horizon, study took preference.With no soccer clubs on her doorstep, travelling to Cookstown-based Mid Ulster Ladies wasnt feasible.“It was a great team and they were lovely there, but I just couldnt balance it,” Niamh adds. “Now I have got involved with DC, it is only down the road and my Granny and Granda live in Draperstown.”It wasnt until the age of  that she began her soccer career with Queens.“I just thought I have the opportunity now to start something I wanted, I joined their team in  and I havent looked back since,” Niamh points out.“Every evening, you were looking forward to training. You make friends for le and it is such a great sport.”When Chairman Paul McCallion floated the idea of a ladies team in Draperstown, she jumped at the chance. There was no second thought required.“I want to give the younger ones the opportunity from that age to be able to play football instead of waiting until they are . The atmosphere around DC, you couldnt get nicer people,” Niamh enthused. googletag.cmd.push COACHING Despite having her coaching qualication tucked away, the sporting lockdown kept her itching to get started. Enthusiasm morphed into frustration.“I was raging because there was no sport and I wanted to get straight out into it,” Niamh adds.“For me, coaching is so rewarding. Even when you are taking the session, at the start the players are a bit timid, but by the end of the session, especially the young ones, you can see how much they have progressed. For me, that gives me a real buzz.”“They are playing with their own age group,with girls. Through the years, theyll build a team with each other. “I have learned so much from the last two years, so imagine young girls learning the game from a young age. The love of the game and even building a team with each other.”In her younger days, she remembers her Granda Malachy taking her to the St Colms Draperstown school and Ballinascreen camogie teams he was involved in. There is a photo doing the rounds of a young Niamh, as a mascot, perched at the front of a team photo.Niamhs love for soccer came from watching the US womens national team and their promotion of the game. The Los Angeles based Angel City team, starting up in , will be the th team in the National Womens Soccer League.     Tobin Heath inspired Niamhs interest in football.  “When you look at the US team, they are a successful team with big players like Tobin Heath. She is such somebody I would look towards,” Niamh adds.Her engineering background comes to the fore as she number crunches the rise of the game. The most watched game, the USAs - win over Holland in the  World Cup Final had an increase of  percent in just four years.Add in the Northern Ireland ladies qualication for a first ever European Womens Championships. Local heroes. Niamh was starstruck when Northern Ireland ladies captain Marissa Callaghan came to DC Diamonds first senior session recently.“Those are the types of people, idols youd want to be, those you see on the TV,” Niamh said, while remembering some of the advice.“Marissa told us to aim to play on the Northern Ireland team. It is about having expectations and always wanting to better yourself....dont doubt yourself.”The first session brought excitement. Others have declared an interest in joining the senior squad, coached by Chloe McPeake and Alice Bradley. Niamh will also weigh in with a helping hand.“It was such a great session, they had it down to a tee,” Niamh stated. “It was a fun session, we played a fun and competitive game. There is a balance, it is recreational and there is a chance to play more seriously.”Niamh urges others to come along. The door is open to everyone.“I have made friends for le, people from America and England and just down the road,” she concludes of her soccer involvement so far.“Even the confidence you get from being on a team, you build so much as a person and you are out there getting fit. It is a great release.“It is a bit of fun and it can be competitiveyou want. It is about getting out there, enjoying the game, the great game that it is.” The Draperstown Celtic Senior Diamonds train every Sunday morning at .am at the Back Row G pitch in Draperstown.

That acted as a comfort as I was in similar surroundings when we played France, said Hogan.Ireland started the match strongly, with the game plan of keeping the ball tightly in control until the hour mark. The green and white outfit betted on having the superior stamina over their Italian counterparts which would ultimately help them see off the game comfortably.ldquoWe certainly kept them into the middle of the field throughout the first half, said Hogan.ldquoWe knew coming into the game that we had to be patient andwe wanted the result we needed to be in control until at least  minutes had went on the clock.ldquoWe knew our test fitness is better than Italyrsquos and we would have the legs to get over the line.Ireland faced an early scare when they lost their captain Ciara Grfin to a head injury assessment within the opening quarter of the game. Grfin was subsequently replaced with Hannah OrsquoConnor.ldquoWe had prepared foranyone got a yellow card whilst in training, so when Ciara went off the field we had an idea on how to manage, said Hogan.ldquoWe had Hannah come on the pitch and with her leadership she showed great composure and intelligence. I think we did really well considering we lost our captain.Ireland maintained in control and comfortably seen out the contest to secure third place in this yearrsquos Six Nations. After the final whistle blew Griggs briefly congratulated Hogan on her performance. The local rugby ace said she was lsquomostly happyrsquo with the sht she put in.ldquoIn the first  minutes I made a few silly errors, but i just had to bounce back from that and I was happy with my defensive work.

However, he did not make it through to show his impressive main course and dessert to the judges.Both chefs threw their all into devising four courses, including an appetiser and pre-dessert mdash based on the theme celebrating British innovation.Hopes were high for East Down given that Dundrum chef Alex Browne Greene, from EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, got two dishes to the national final last year and narrowly missed out on being crowned champion of champions at the banquet.Gemmarsquos starter was a twist on gammon, egg and chips, inspired by Kegomatic from Queenrsquos University students and for her fish course, the innovation shown in the building of the Titanic inspired her sea bass fish dish.She used William Clannyrsquos invention of the safety lamp for miners for her main course of lamb and the influence of astronomer Alice Everett as the first woman to work for the Royal Observatory to inspire her dessert, Out of this World.The dessert was her favourite course and she was delighted to have been scored a ten by chef Daniel Clford.ldquoIrsquom known for my desserts so I was really delighted to have got that score from Daniel, said Gemma.ldquoI also took his advice on my main course as therersquos no better person to take advice from and generally scaled back my dishes and made them more refined as the comments back were that there was too much on the plate.While Gemma was proud to have made it through to the regional final, she said she was not disappointed at not going through to the national judging.ldquoTo be honest, it was a bit of a relief as I did not know how I was going to go up against all the other chefs in the national final as I have only been cheffing for seven years and am mostly self-taught, she revealed.Gemma went into the competition, which was filmed last November, full of confidence and determined to do her best.ldquoI think I just went into a zone and concentrated on my own dishes and not to get too caught up in what the other chefs were doing, she said.ldquoPhelim was brilliant on the day and deserved to win and I remember saying on the programme that the better chef won. I hope that he goes on to get a dish to the banquet.While she has been receiving fantastic customer feedback from her popup, A Peculiar Tea, which she has been operating during the lockdowns, Gemma admitted that cooking was not her first career choice.ldquoWhen I left school I actually went to Queenrsquos University to do a nursing degree but a medical issue I experienced meant that I couldnrsquot complete it, she said.She then studied Bio Medical Sciences for a while before going to Ulster University to complete a software engineering degree.Her love of food and cooking mdash inspired by her chef mother mdash was strictly a hobby until the age of  when she took her first job at Slims Kitchen on the Lisburn Road in Belfast where she cut her teeth for a year while doing a Culinary Masters course.For four years Gemma continued studying and working full-time at a iety of great establishments, such as the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast where she rose to head pastry chef, before moving The Old Inn, Crawfordsburn, where she worked all the sections and eventually became sous chef.She has been in Alexanders for the last two years and got the opportunity to become an owner last year.ldquoIt may have taken my several attempts before I found the right career but I was determined not to do any job that I did not absolutely love and was passionate about.Like Gemma, Brunels chef Paul Cunningham hopes to be invited back next year after his disappointing showing this year.The  year-old had hoped to get to the regional judging to please his six-year-old daughter, Farrah.ldquoFarrah and I are massive fans of the show, we watch every year and of course, I wanted to further than I did but Irsquove got over the disappointment now and concentrating on getting the restaurant ready for re-opening, Paul told the Recorder.Paul is known for only using local produce from within a -mile radius of Newcastle and foraging for herbs and plants.His menu reflected his locality and passion for pioneers including Belfast-born Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Isambard Kingdom Brunelrsquos refloating of the SS Great Britain in Dundrum Bay mdash an incident which led him to name his restaurant by the great engineer.Paul only got to cook his starter and main course on the show but said his main course and dessert were showstoppers, with the main course of lamb called Healthy Heart made without using any salt or butter, inspired by Frank Pantridge who invited the portable defibrillator.He also collaborated with Doran Precision Engineering to create a model of the Titanic for one of his dishes and a special dish to show off his dessert, the Atom Smasher, inspired by Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Condemnation.jpg","title":"Condemnation over Murlough vandalism  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have criticised vandals responsible for setting fire to a gate at the Murlough Nature Reserve two weekends ago as  firefighters were battling a huge blaze in the nearby Mournes.The vandals also left behind a trail of rubbish at the internationally acclaimed area with their actions condemned by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.They say it ldquobeggars belief that while the raging wildfire destroyed  acres of rich habitat across the Mournes, there were people who thought that it was appropriate to start a fire at the Nature Reserve.The politicians also revealed that National Trust staff had to remove  bags of rubbish from the Reserve location on the Sunday the fire in the Mournes was eventually extinguished.Cllr Devlin said as young people drank alcohol and watched the blaze raging across the mountains, they set fire to a pedestrian gate which is also used to prevent Exmore ponies at the Reserve from escaping.ldquoI am really shocked at this behaviour, she said. ldquoBy the Saturday evening, everyone in the locality had an idea of the widespread damage in the Mournes but these iniduals thought it appropriate to cause more damage and potentially risk another blaze.ldquoI have no idea who these iniduals were and how old they are so I am appealing to people young and old.

That controlling impulse is in place in this current election for the DUP leadership. Candidates for the top position have been banned from doing interviews during the contest.This is not only an unreasonable bar, it is an unwise one for the DUP. It will make it easier for the party to select a replacement to Arlene Foster who has avoided saying something they later regret, or indeed that the whole DUP regrets. But it means the candidates cannot be grilled their thinking.This is problematic at any time, but above all now. For example, yesterday Mrs Foster attended a North South meeting, again raising doubt as to DUP policy on such meetings.And the latest troubling development on legacy, relating to the RUC , coming a day after the disturbing case around the killing of the IRA terrorist Joe McCann collapsed, means that we do need to know what the DUP believes about how to proceed legacy.Opacity will not help the party. It will merely, for example, lead people to assume that the DUP is going to take a positiononly later to be disappointedno such action is forthcoming.It would be better for the key positions of the two candidates to be made clear to both the DUP and the wider population before they are chosen.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...A diagram in one of the documents issued by the department, entitled: ‘Appendix a: Review Cycle for Moving towards Normalised Visiting in Care Homes in NI Pathway’The new changes to visiting rules for care homes take effect from today.The web page where the department announced these changes gives almost no details of what they involve.Instead, readers are re-directed to two separate files:gt “Visiting with Care: A Pathway” gt And “A Pathway to Enhanced Visiting” Both files begin by stating: “This document replaces, in its entirety, the Care Homes elements of the Department of Heath’s visiting guidance COVID-: Regional Principles for Visiting in Care Settings in Northern Ireland, which was originally published in June  with the most recent version taking effect from st March .”“This goes to the very heart of what I’ve been saying for weeks,” said Mr Buckley.“The messaging and communication from the Department of Health in relation to these issues is far too complex.“It’s in riddles, tied up in large documents. They need to spell it out very clearly.“I’ve been shouting quite loud at the committee that we need a really consistently clear articulation in relation to these issues.”He said many people who have loved-ones in care homes have not got the time – or perhaps even the ability – to read through  pages of documentation.“You think that after a year-long of this nonsense, the department would realise they need to have clear, consistent guidance...“Sadly these latest documents show they just haven’t learned the lesson.”Perhaps the main changes kicking in tomorrow which the News Letter has gleanedis that the number of visits allowed per week will be upped from one to two– with the new guidance stating that such visits should be “accessible over a seven-day period as well as after pm”.These visits will be capped at two people at one time , for one hour.Handwashing will replace the use of gloves to enable handholding, but aprons and masks will remain. In addition to the two visits allowed above, church ministers and faith groups may book a visit. All visitors are to be screened for Covid-.This will be followed by another set of relaxations four weeks later.Read more from this reporter at the links below: Click here – Sinn Fein man: NI state’s law was the envy of racist apartheid regime  Click here – NI centenary celebrations ‘a far cry from Republic of Ireland extravaganza’——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Unlike many other retailers, Poundland had a relatively steady  in the face of coronavirus restrictions, thanks in part toits status as an essential retailer and strong demand for expanded clothing and homewares ranges.It opted to temporarily close certain sites despite being allowed to remain open, and said sales among stores that traded throughoutthe year rose.In October, it bought frozen food retailer Fultons Foods as it looks to ramp up its food offering, and hasaccelerated the roll-out of chilled and frozen food to  stores.Barry Williams, Poundland managing director, said: ldquoThis is the biggest transformation in our history as we look to secure our future for another  years.Earlier this month, the owner of Poundland announced plans to list its shares in Warsaw instead of London, in its multibillion-pound stock market float.Pepco, which also runs the PepCo and Dealz brands, had previously said that it was considering stock exchanges in the UK and Poland.The listing price and total valuation has not yet been disclosed, although it is reported by Sky to be worth about pound billion.Pepco trades from , stores across  European countries, including more than , stores in Poland.A version of this article originally appeared on our sister title, NationalWorldGet involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

No. claimed the ‘short, controlled procession’ was followed by a large police presence including eight police vehicles and ‘no less than three police cameramen videographers.However the PSNI pointed out that the Health Protection Regulations remain in place adding: “It is important that people continue to adhere to them.” Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor said: “Police were in attendance at a notied parade at Main Street in Markethill on Monday rd May.PSNI officers at the Markethill Protestant Boys Flute Band parade in the town to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland, on May , .“In relation to potential breaches of the Health ProtectionRegulations NI , warnings were given and an evidence gathering operation put in place. We will now review all the footage gathered.”In a statement on Facebook the Lodge said Markethill Protestant Boys Flute Band had concerns prior to the event as the Parades Commission had classied the parade as ‘sensitive’.On top of issues with the Parades Commission, which had determined the parade legal, the Lodge described the actions of the PSNI as ‘intimidatory’.“Before this short, controlled procession began several police officers began to gather around the band. No less than three police cameramen videographers were focused directly on the band. As they formed to start parading, a loudspeaker rang out directly at the side of the band. They were informed that they must disperse! PSNI officers at the Markethill Protestant Boys Flute Band parade in the town to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland, on May , .“As they moved off, several PSNI cameramen followed the parade akin to the ‘blocks’ of soldiers some will remember from past bad days. One PSNI cameraman continued to take  video for about half of the procession.“If that were not intimidating enough, it was observed that there were at least, at least eight marked police vehicles present in and in the vicinity of the town!“Tonight’s events are deeply disturbing for many in the local community. Over and above all Parades Commission and Covid related issuesthe proportionality observed this evening is hugely concerning. To have this single band of young men, women and children videoed and photographed in what many would consider as an overtly intimidatory manner, is worrying enough, but to have eight police vehicles present for an event of a few dozen people is blatantly disproportionate! “What possible reasoning and justication can be given for such an approach  “These issues need immediately addressed. Our political representatives locally and beyond need to make representation now and get questions asked.“All efforts to get the PSNI to officially detail the restrictions upon legally notied parades and the related legislation in advance, have been ignored. We are in the situation that so-called ‘illegal’ protests are not permitted, travelling with legal events not being permitted! For any outsider it would appear that these exercises are not about the law or health. To any outsider it would appear we are in the midst of an attempt to ensure Unionism and Loyalism voices are silenced.”TUV leader Jim Allister said: “The actions of the PSNI last night around a band parade in Markethill have further damaged confidence in policing within the Unionist community.“How it was thought that it would be a good idea to interfere in a small parade marking the centenary of NI in an overwhelmingly Protestant town well known for its parading culture is beyond me. It is certainly hard to square with the police approach to Republican funerals!“Outdoor band practices have been taking place across the country in full compliance with the law in recent days. Yesterday, in many parts of NI, inidual bands paraded in a manner which was compliant with the restrictions to mark NI’s th birthday without any interference from the police. Why was a dferent approach adopted in Markethill “It is important to note that this was a legal parade. Although it was marked as sensitive by the Parades Commission – a bizarre decision given the history of parading in the area – the organisers made every effort to keep within the law. This is, of course, in stark contrast with the actions of Republican lawmakers at a terrorist funeral last summer.“The issue is compounded by the fact that the PSNI were able to deploy no less than eight patrol cars and officers with cameras in an area where visible policing is often thin on the ground. “Frankly the PSNI need to take a hard look at how this matter was approached and the damage they have done to their image, not just in the Markethill area but across Northern Ireland.”  \"       \"  Most PopularLodge criticises policing of band parade celebrating NI centenaryJamie Bryson to address Markethill protest - urges next DUP leader to ‘break a little delph’New job transforms the le of dog lover JoshuaTeenage girl taken to hospital after crash in NI townAppeal to help locate ‘high risk’ missing personMost Popular found ‘safe and well’\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.portadowntimes news urgent-appeal-to-find-missing-ni-schoolboy- itm_sourceparsely-api\" found ‘safe and well’\" \"\" width\"\"Missing NI schoolboyfound ‘safe and well’Application for eight new dwellingsCouncil goes behind closed doorsWedding plans afootafter girlfriend said ‘yes’ to MLA’s proposalLoyalists claim PSNI approach to Markethill parade was ‘intimidatory’ due to scale of officers filming and vehicles                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kafWEX sc-feJyhm dbjzDR\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFollow us          "},{"url":null,"title":"application for eight new dwellings ","story":"Minister visits town as restrictions eased   Teenage girl taken to hospital after crash in NI townNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoHomes and GardensLestyleCarsHomes and GardensPublic NoticesAdvertise My BusinessNewsPoliticsApplication for eight new dwellingsA planning application has been submitted that,successful, will bring eight semi-detached dwellings to Portadown.By The NewsroomWednesday, th May , : am  \"       \"  Agent Gray Design Ltd has submitted an application on behalf of applicantManx, to bring eight, three bedroom, semi-detached properties to a site m NW of no  Ballybay Meadows, off the Loughgall Road.The . hectare site is currently identied as vacant development land, says the land is not in a flood plain and that the surface water created by the development will be disposed of via the mains.Submitted on Monday, March , the application was validated on Monday, April .The neighbour consultation period expires on Wednesday, May , while the standard consultationperiod expires on Monday, May .

NoticesAdvertise My BusinessNewsPoliticsCouncil goes behind closed doorsArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council has taken the decision to conduct the majority of its businesses behind closed doors in May.By The NewsroomWednesday, th May , : pm  \"       \"  With the exception of its planning committee, the rest of Council’s committees will not meet this month.Instead, four working groups – one for each committee, made up of the members of each committee, will meet behind closed doors to discuss Council’s business.Any decision reached at these working groups will require unanimous support before the outcomes are adopted by Council with Council’s Chief Executive, Roger Wilson, signing off on them through powers given to him under delegated authority.Roger Wilson, Chief Executive, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council.When asked why the decision was taken to conduct business in this fashion, a Council spokesperson said it was a result of the change in legislation regarding virtual meetings.The regulations allowing for meetings to take place virtually came into effect on May , , but are due to expire on May  of this year.The Department for Communities has confirmed that new regulations will not be in place for a seamless continuation of remote meetings but has advised the regulations should be in place in early June.At least one other Council is continuing with its programme of virtual committee meetings, streamed live to the public, with the decisions reached implemented by the Chief Executive under delegated authority.With this in mind, it is unclear why Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council has decided that stopping the general public from viewing these meetings is the best option.Attempting to explain that situation, a Council spokesperson said: “This decisionwas taken due to the change in legislation regarding virtual meetings.“In the absence of formal committees for the month of May , it has been approved by Council that it will operatea delegated authority approach for the implementationof decisions.“However, council officers will continue to brief elected members on key issues and seek their direction through a series of working groups.“As Council will operate under delegated authority for this period, the livestreaming of meetings will not take place.”When asked to explain why, given the ongoing COVID- pandemic and the planned roll out of the vaccine, the time limited legislation permitting the holding of virtual council meetings was allowed to expire, a spokesperson for the Department for Communities offered little in the way of explanation.“The action needed to extend this legislation is currently being progressed,” said the DfC spokesperson.Editor’s message:Thank you

Had these been paid for, as they would have been in the   financial year, this could have generated £, for Council.Speaking at March’s meeting of Council’s environmental services committee, Council’s head of environmental services, Barry Patience, accepted  was not a “normal year” for data on the use of the service to be collected.Although he did note that prior to the introduction of free bulky waste collections, the service had been generating £-, in revenue for Council.SDLP Councillor Ciaran Toman made a proposal at that meeting for officers to bring a report back to the committee on the possibility of an extension of the fee free bulky waste collection service.The proposal was seconded by his party colleague, Councillor Thomas Larkham.Speaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service this week, Cllr Toman welcomed the working group’s ability to speak with one voice on this matter.“It has been a tough year for everyone,” said Cllr Toman. “While Council carried out , bulky waste collections over the past year, the recorded fly-tipping incidents jumped from  in   to  in  .“This suggests some form of direct correlation between the closing of our recycling centres and the postponed bulky waste collections which were affected by the pandemic.“I very much see bulky waste collections as an essential service in Council’s efforts to tackle fly-tipping and keeping our streets and countryside clean.“I am pleased there was unanimous agreement to maintain the system as it is, fee-free and review it again in a further  months.”Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
